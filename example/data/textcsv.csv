1,"Sideways  dominates  Spirit  awards  |||    The  comedy  Sideways  has  dominated  this  year's  Independent  Spirit  Awards,  winning  all  six  of  the  awards  for  which  it  was  nominated.  |||    It  was  named  best  film  while  Alexander  Payne  won  best  director  and  best  screenplay,  along  with  writing  partner  Jim  Taylor.  It  also  won  acting  awards  for  stars  Paul  Giamatti,  Thomas  Haden  Church  and  Virginia  Madsen.  Sideways  is  tipped  to  do  well  at  Sunday's  Oscars,  with  five  nominations.  |||    The  awards,  now  in  their  20th  year,  are  given  to  films  made  outside  the  traditional  studio  system,  and  are  traditionally  held  the  day  before  the  Oscars.  Other  winners  included  Catalina  Sandino  Moreno,  who  took  best  actress  for  her  role  as  a  drug  smuggler  in  the  Colombian  drama  Maria  Full  of  Grace.  Moreno  is  also  nominated  for  best  actress  at  the  Oscars.  The  best  first  screenplay  award  went  to  Joshua  Marston  for  Maria  Full  of  Grace.  Scrubs  star  Zach  Braff  won  the  award  for  best  first  feature  for  Garden  State,  which  he  wrote,  directed  and  starred  in.  Oscar-nominated  euthanasia  film  The  Sea  Inside  from  Spain  won  best  foreign  film,  while  Metallica:  Some  Kind  Of  Monster  was  awarded  best  documentary.  Actor  Rodrigo  de  la  Serna  took  the  best  debut  performance  prize  for  The  Motorcycle  Diaries.  The  awards  are  voted  for  by  the  9,000  members  of  the  Independent  Feature  Project/Los  Angeles,  which  includes  actors,  directors,  writers  and  other  industry  professionals.  Last  year's  big  winner,  Lost  In  Translation,  went  on  to  win  the  Oscar  for  best  original  screenplay,  for  writer-director  Sofia  Coppola. "

0,"Reliance  unit  loses  Anil  Ambani  |||    Anil  Ambani,  the  younger  of  the  two  brothers  in  charge  of  India's  largest  private  company,  has  resigned  from  running  its  petrochemicals  subsidiary.  |||    The  move  is  likely  to  be  seen  as  the  latest  twist  in  a  feud  between  Mr  Ambani  and  his  brother  Mukesh.  Anil,  45,  has  stepped  down  as  director  and  vice-chairman  of  Indian  Petrochemicals  Corporation  (IPC).  The  company  was  not  available  for  comment.  IPC  is  46%-owned  by  Reliance  Industries  which  in  turn  is  run  by  Mukesh.  Mukesh  has  spoken  of  ownership  issues  between  the  two  brothers,  who  took  over  control  of  the  Reliance  empire  following  the  death  of  their  father  in  July,  2002.  |||    Reliance's  operations  have  massive  reach,  covering  textiles,  telecommunications,  petrochemicals,  petroleum  refining  and  marketing,  as  well  as  oil  and  gas  exploration,  insurance  and  financial  services.  The  brothers'  spat  has  hogged  headlines  in  India  during  recent  weeks,  despite  a  denial  from  the  family  that  there  was  anything  wrong.  Speculation  has  been  rife  about  what  has  triggered  the  stand-off,  with  some  observers  blaming  Anil's  political  ambitions,  others  the  heavy  investment  by  Mukesh  and  Reliance  in  a  mobile  phone  venture.  Shares  of  IPC  dipped  on  the  news  in  Mumbai,  but  recovered  to  trade  almost  6%  higher.  Reliance  shares  added  1.7%,  while  Reliance  Energy,  headed  by  Anil,  jumped  7%. "

0,"Business  confidence  dips  in  Japan  |||    Business  confidence  among  Japanese  manufacturers  has  weakened  for  the  first  time  since  March  2003,  the  quarterly  Tankan  survey  has  found.  |||    Slower  economic  growth,  rising  oil  prices,  a  stronger  yen  and  weaker  exports  were  blamed  for  the  fall.  December's  confidence  level  was  below  that  seen  in  September,  the  Bank  of  Japan  said.  However,  September's  reading  was  the  strongest  for  13  years.  ""The  economy  is  at  a  pause  but  unlikely  to  fall"",  the  economy  minister  said.  ""It  will  feel  a  bit  slower  (next  year)  than  this  year,  and  growth  may  be  a  bit  more  gentle  but  the  situation  is  that  the  recovery  will  continue,""  said  economy  minister  Heizo  Takenaka.  In  the  Bank  of  Japan's  December  survey,  the  balance  of  big  manufacturers  saying  business  conditions  are  better,  minus  those  saying  they  are  worse,  was  22,  down  from  26  in  September.  |||    Japan's  economy  grew  by  just  0.1%  in  the  three  months  to  September,  according  revised  data  issued  this  month.  With  the  recovery  slowing,  the  world's  second  biggest  economy  is  now  expected  grow  by  0.2%  in  2004.  The  Tankan  index  is  based  on  a  survey  of  10,227  firms.  Big  manufacturers  were  even  more  pessimistic  about  the  first  quarter  of  2005;  their  views  suggest  the  March  reading  could  go  as  low  as  15  -  still  in  positive  territory,  but  weaker.  The  dollar's  decline  has  strengthened  the  yen,  making  Japanese  exports  more  expensive  in  the  US.  China's  attempts  to  cool  down  its  fast-growing  economy  have  also  hit  Japanese  industry's  sales  abroad.  Confidence  among  non-manufacturers  was  unchanged  in  the  final  quarter  of  2004,  but  it  is  forecast  to  drop  one  point  in  the  March  survey.  Nonetheless,  Japanese  firms  have  been  stepping  up  capital  investment,  and  the  survey  found  the  pace  is  quickening.  Companies  reported  they  expect  to  invest  7.7%  more  in  the  year  to  March  2005  than  the  previous  year  -  up  from  expectations  of  6.1%  increase  in  the  September  Tankan. "

0,"BMW  drives  record  sales  in  Asia  |||    BMW  has  forecast  sales  growth  of  at  least  10%  in  Asia  this  year  after  registering  record  sales  there  in  2004.  |||    The  luxury  carmaker  saw  strong  sales  of  its  three  marques  -  BMW,  Mini  and  Rolls-Royce  -  in  Asia  last  year  after  the  launch  of  three  new  models.  The  company,  which  is  vying  with  Mercedes-Benz  for  the  title  of  leading  premium  carmaker,  is  confident  about  its  prospects  for  the  region  in  2005.  It  is  launching  a  revamped  version  of  its  3-Series  saloon  class  next  month.  |||    BMW  sold  nearly  95,000  cars  in  Asia  last  year,  up  2.6%  on  2003.  |||    BMW-brand  sales  rose  2.3%  to  80,600  while  sales  of  Mini  models  rose  3.6%  to  14,800.  There  was  also  a  significant  increase  in  sales  of  Rolls-Royces  on  the  continent.  BMW  sold  more  than  100  of  the  iconic  models  compared  with  just  ten  the  previous  year.  The  German  carmaker  is  aiming  to  boost  annual  sales  in  Asia  to  150,000  by  2008.  ""Here  in  Asia,  we  consider  a  double-digit  increase  in  retail  on  the  order  of  10  to  15%  to  be  realistic  on  the  basis  of  current  features,""  said  Helmut  Panke,  BMW's  group  chief  executive.  |||    China  remains  the  main  area  of  concern  for  BMW  after  sales  there  fell  16%  last  year.  However,  BMW  is  hopeful  of  a  much  better  year  in  2005  as  its  direct  investment  in  China  begins  to  pay  dividends.  The  company  only  began  assembling  luxury  high-powered  sedans  in  China  in  2003.  2004  was  generally  a  good  year  for  BMW,  which  saw  revenues  from  its  core  car-making  operations  rise  11%.

2,"Police  chief  backs  drinking  move  |||    A  chief  constable  has  backed  the  introduction  of  24-drinking,  saying  police  had  a  responsibility  to  ensure  people  could  benefit  from  a  law  change.  |||    However,  Norfolk  police  chief  Andy  Hayman  also  warned  that  a  great  deal  of  preparatory  work  was  still  needed.  ""I  don't  subscribe  to  the  views  of  some  of  my  colleagues  who  are  coming  out  and  objecting  to  it,""  he  said.  His  comments  come  after  the  Liberal  Democrats  backed  Tory  demands  that  the  government's  plans  be  put  on  hold.  Andy  Hayman  said  he  did  not  agree  with  politicians  and  senior  police  officers  who  have  objected  to  the  plans,  which  come  into  force  on  7  February.  ""I  feel  that  is  a  premature  position  to  be  taking,""  he  said.  Among  those  who  have  criticised  the  plans  are  the  UK's  top  policeman  Sir  John  Stevens.  |||    The  Metropolitan  police  chief  said  last  week  that  the  plans  for  24-hour  drinking  should  be  re-examined  because  of  a  binge  drinking  ""epidemic"".  However,  Mr  Hayman  said:  ""It  would  be  totally  unacceptable  in  my  view  for  a  chief  constable  to  say,  'I'm  very  sorry'.  He  said  that  police  should  make  sure  that  responsible  people  who  wanted  a  change  could  benefit  from  more  liberal  legislation.  ""My  view  is  that  I  have  got  a  responsibility  to  create  an  environment  where  that  can  happen,  ""  he  said.  However,  he  believes  a  lot  of  preparatory  work  is  still  needed  to  be  done  by  police,  local  authorities  and  the  drinks  industry  before  the  nation  was  ready  for  24-hour  drinking.  But  he  is  confident  problems  in  the  early  days  can  be  ""ironed  out"".  He  believed  the  majority  of  people  favoured  this  law  change  and  ""we  have  to  accept  that  lifestyles  are  changing"".  But  aspects  such  as  transport,  and  basic  things  such  as  making  sure  public  toilets  are  open  all  night  had  to  be  taken  into  account.  |||    Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  has  defended  the  Licensing  Act,  saying  it  is  wrong  to  deny  people  the  relaxed  hours  enjoyed  elsewhere  in  Europe  because  of  a  ""tiny  minority""  of  violent  binge  drinkers.  A  six-month  transitional  period  starts  on  7  February  during  which  time  venues  can  apply  for  extended  licences.  The  Conservatives  have  called  for  24-hour  drinking  to  be  shelved  until  the  problems  of  binge  drinking  are  solved.  On  Monday,  the  Lib  Dems  also  called  for  a  delay.  Lib  Dem  Home  Affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  said:  ""It  would  clearly  be  prudent  to  allow  the  police  and  local  authorities  more  time  to  prepare  for  flexible  drinking  hours.""  Chief  constable  Mr  Hayman  acknowledged  that  binge  drinking  did  cause  problems.  ""If  you  come  to  Norwich  on  a  Friday  or  Saturday  night  you  will  see  things  going  on  that  will  you  make  you  feel  ashamed.  ""However,  I  want  industry  to  succeed  in  Norwich  and  I  want  Norwich  to  be  the  recognised  nightspot  of  East  Anglia.  ""There  is  no  way  I  want  to  say  we  cannot  manage  it  or  police  it.  We  can."" "

1,"Critics  back  Aviator  for  Oscars  |||    Martin  Scorsese's  The  Aviator  will  win  best  film  at  the  Oscars,  according  to  the  UK's  leading  movie  critics.  |||    But  several  of  those  surveyed  by  the  BBC  News  website  think  the  veteran  film-maker  will  lose  the  best  director  prize  to  Clint  Eastwood.  Most  of  the  critics  tipped  Jamie  Foxx  and  Hilary  Swank  to  scoop  best  actor  and  actress  for  Ray  and  Million  Dollar  Baby  respectively.  The  jury  comprised  experts  and  critics  from  the  top  UK  film  publications.  The  panel  also  revealed  which  nominees  they  would  personally  prefer  to  win.  |||    All  expect  The  Aviator  to  win  best  film,  but  many  think  it  will  be  a  close  race  between  Scorsese's  Howard  Hughes  biopic  and  Eastwood's  boxing  drama  Million  Dollar  Baby.  The  other  films  nominated  are  wine  comedy  Sideways,  factual  drama  Finding  Neverland,  and  Ray  Charles  biopic  Ray.  |||    ""I'm  pretty  sure  this  is  the  year  of  The  Aviator,  though  my  own  choice  would  be  Sideways,""  said  the  Observer's  Philip  French.  ""Sideways  should  win  but  it  doesn't  have  a  hope,""  said  Jamie  Graham  of  Total  Film,  a  position  shared  by  Film  2005  presenter  Jonathan  Ross.  ""The  form  going  in  to  the  Oscars  points  to  The  Aviator,  but  I  liked  Million  Dollar  Baby  more,""  said  Tim  Dams,  news  editor  of  trade  weekly  Screen  International.  |||    Five  of  the  eight  critics  tipped  Scorsese  to  win  best  director,  with  Mr  Dams,  Heat's  Charles  Gant  and  Empire's  Angie  Errigo  plumping  for  Eastwood.  Sideway's  Alexander  Payne,  Ray's  Taylor  Hackford  and  British  director  Mike  Leigh  -  nominated  for  period  drama  Vera  Drake  -  are  considered  outsiders  in  this  category.  ""Up  until  recently  I  could  have  sworn  Scorsese  would  get  it  just  for  being  Scorsese,""  Ms  Errigo  told  the  BBC  News  website.  ""But  I'm  beginning  to  think  Eastwood  will  get  it.""  |||    ""I'd  be  very  happy  for  Mike  Leigh  to  win,  but  I  don't  think  he  has  any  chance,""  said  Charles  Gant,  film  editor  of  Heat.  Foxx's  portrayal  of  Ray  Charles  has  already  seen  him  win  prizes  at  the  Golden  Globes,  Baftas  and  Screen  Actors  Guild  Awards.  Mr  Dams  said  this  made  him  ""out-and-out  favourite""  to  be  named  best  actor  on  Oscar  night.  ""Everyone  would  be  incredibly  surprised  if  he  didn't  win,""  he  said.  ""If  you're  a  betting  man,  he's  as  close  as  you  get  to  a  certainty.""  ""If  Paul  Giamatti  was  nominated  for  Sideways  it  would  be  a  different  game,""  says  Total  Film's  Jamie  Graham.  ""But  Foxx  will  and  should  win.""  |||    With  Vera  Drake  star  Imelda  Staunton  nominated  for  best  actress  alongside  Kate  Winslet,  Britain  has  a  good  chance  of  victory  -  on  paper.  Jonathan  Ross,  for  one,  will  be  very  happy  if  Winslet  wins  for  Eternal  Sunshine  of  the  Spotless  Mind.  But  while  Wendy  Ide  of  The  Times  still  thinks  Staunton  has  a  chance,  Heat's  Charles  Gant  believes  her  Bafta  win  will  cut  little  ice  with  Academy  voters.  ""I'd  like  Staunton  to  win,  but  her  chances  are  not  that  great,""  said  Mr  Gant,  who  predicted  a  second  Oscar  for  Hilary  Swank.  |||    ""I  think  Swank  will  win,""  said  Mr  French.  ""Imelda  has  got  as  far  as  she's  going  to  get  playing  that  role.""  Staunton  is  also  the  personal  choice  of  Steven  Gaydos,  executive  editor  of  industry  magazine  Variety.  But  while  he  tipped  Swank  to  win,  he  predicted  it  would  be  a  close  contest.  ""Everything  has  the  ability  to  flip  by  one  vote  and  go  the  other  way,""  he  told  the  BBC  News  website.  ""There's  not  a  sense  that  it's  obvious  how  it's  going  to  go.""  Meanwhile,  thousands  of  people  have  voted  in  a  BBC  Radio  Five  Live  poll  to  find  the  best  film  never  to  have  won  a  best  picture  Oscar.  The  audience  voted  overwhelmingly  for  The  Shawshank  Redemption,  the  1994  Frank  Darabont  tale  of  hope  and  humanity,  which  received  52%  of  the  online  votes  and  68%  of  the  text  messages.  The  other  two  finalists,  Citizen  Kane  and  A  Matter  of  Life  and  Death  split  the  remaining  votes  roughly  equally.  This  year's  Academy  Awards  will  be  shown  in  the  UK  by  Sky  Movies  1  at  0130  GMT  on  Monday.  |||    -  Tim  Dams,  Screen  International:  Film  -  The  Aviator;  director  -  Clint  Eastwood;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Hilary  Swank.  |||    -  Angie  Errigo,  Empire:  Film  -  The  Aviator;  director  -  Clint  Eastwood;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Hilary  Swank.  |||    -  Philip  French,  The  Observer:  Film  -  The  Aviator;  director  -  Martin  Scorsese;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Hilary  Swank.  |||    -  Charles  Gant,  Heat:  Film  -  The  Aviator;  director  -  Clint  Eastwood;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Hilary  Swank.  |||    -  Steven  Gaydos,  Variety:  Film  -  The  Aviator;  director  -  Martin  Scorsese;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Hilary  Swank.  |||    -  Jamie  Graham,  Total  Film:  Film  -  The  Aviator;  director  -  Martin  Scorsese;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Hilary  Swank.  |||    -  Wendy  Ide,  The  Times:  Film  -  The  Aviator;  director  -  Martin  Scorsese;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Imelda  Staunton.  |||    -  Jonathan  Ross,  Film  2005:  Film  -  The  Aviator;  director  -  Martin  Scorsese;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Hilary  Swank.  |||    -  Tim  Dams,  Screen  International:  Film  -  Million  Dollar  Baby;  director  -  Clint  Eastwood;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Hilary  Swank.  |||    -  Angie  Errigo,  Empire:  Film  -  The  Aviator;  director  -  Martin  Scorsese;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Hilary  Swank.  |||    -  Philip  French,  The  Observer:  Film  -  Sideways;  director  -  Martin  Scorsese;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Imelda  Staunton.  |||    -  Charles  Gant,  Heat:  Film  -  Sideways;  director  -  Mike  Leigh;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Imelda  Staunton.  |||    -  Steven  Gaydos,  Variety:  Film  -  Million  Dollar  Baby;  director  -  Clint  Eastwood;  actor  -  Don  Cheadle;  actress  -  Imelda  Staunton.  |||    -  Jamie  Graham,  Total  Film:  Film  -  Sideways;  director  -  Alexander  Payne;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Hilary  Swank.  |||    -  Wendy  Ide,  The  Times:  Film  -  Sideways;  director  -  Alexander  Payne;  actor  -  Don  Cheadle;  actress  -  Imelda  Staunton.  |||    -  Jonathan  Ross,  Film  2005:  Film  -  Sideways;  director  -  Clint  Eastwood;  actor  -  Jamie  Foxx;  actress  -  Kate  Winslet.

2,"Muslims  discuss  election  concerns  |||    Issues  that  Muslims  should  be  considering  before  voting  in  the  next  general  election  are  to  be  debated  by  UK  community  representatives.  |||    The  event  is  being  held  by  the  Muslim  Association  of  Britain  (MAB),  which  believes  Muslim  voters  could  influence  the  result  in  up  to  50  constituencies.  Last  year  MAB,  which  opposed  the  war  in  Iraq,  urged  Muslims  not  to  vote  for  Labour  in  the  European  elections.  But  a  spokesman  stressed  the  meeting  was  ""not  necessarily  anti-Labour"".  ""This  meeting  is  not  anti-party  in  particular,  it's  anti-policy,  it's  on  the  issues  we  are  going  to  ask  Muslims  to  vote  on,""  MAB  spokesman  Dr  Azzam  Tamimi  said  of  Tuesday's  event.  |||    ""There  are  issues  of  concern  to  Muslims,  and  Muslims  generally  agree  on  them  but  have  not  in  the  past  been  aware  of  how  a  vote  can  serve  these  issues.""  Dr  Tamimi  said  the  main  issues  Muslims  should  consider  were  what  he  referred  to  as  the  war  on  Iraq,  the  Palestinian  situation,  the  erosion  of  civil  liberties  for  Muslims  in  the  UK  and  economic,  social  and  education  problems.  |||    Approximately  1.1m  of  the  UK's  1.6m  Muslims  are  of  voting  age.  Previous  election  research  has  shown  the  overwhelming  majority  have  traditionally  voted  Labour,  but  more  recent  studies  have  suggested  Labour  support  has  been  falling  away  significantly  among  some  Muslim  voters.  |||    Anger  over  the  war  in  Iraq  has  appeared  to  be  the  main  reason,  with  many  saying  it  was  ""unjustified"".  Representatives  from  a  number  of  Muslim  organisations  will  attend  Tuesday's  event.  Among  them  will  be  the  Muslim  Council  of  Britain  (MCB).  The  chairman  of  the  MCB's  public  affairs  committee,  Sher  Khan,  said  the  war  in  Iraq  would  be  a  ""significant  factor""  affecting  Muslims'  voting  intentions.  ""I  think  it's  going  to  be  quite  significant  because  of  the  number  of  seats  in  which  they  could  have  an  impact,""  Mr  Khan  said.  |||    However,  Professor  John  Curtice,  of  the  University  of  Strathclyde,  is  sceptical  about  how  much  difference  tactical  voting  by  Muslims  could  make.  ""For  the  most  part  the  Labour  constituencies  where  there's  a  large  Muslim  community  are  relatively  safe,  but  there  are  one  or  two  that  are  not  quite  so  safe,""  Professor  Curtice  said.  |||    The  constituencies  where  Labour  was  most  at  risk  from  a  Muslim  tactical  vote  were  Bethnal  Green,  in  east  London,  and  Rochdale  in  Lancashire,  he  added.  In  Bethnal  Green,  former  Labour  MP  George  Galloway,  who  founded  the  anti-war  party  Respect,  is  standing  against  sitting  MP  Oona  King,  who  had  a  10,000-vote  majority  in  2001.  In  Rochdale,  the  Liberal  Democrats  -  the  mainstream  party  a  2004  ICM  survey  showed  was  benefiting  most  from  Muslim  disaffection  with  Labour  -  secured  second  place  in  the  2001  election,  securing  just  under  6,000  votes  fewer  than  Labour's  Lorna  Fitzsimons.  But  Professor  Curtice  said  the  Muslim  anti-war  vote  could  be  split  between  the  Liberal  Democrats  and  Respect,  meaning  neither  would  benefit  much  at  the  ballot  box.  ""Ironically  the  Tories  might  be  the  beneficiaries  if  Labour  does  lose  seats,  which  is  generally  the  case,""  he  said.  But  Dr  Tamimi  said  MAB's  intention  was  not  to  ""empower""  the  Tories.  ""We  know  the  next  government  will  be  Labour,  but  we  are  aiming  to  send  a  message  that  it  will  make  a  difference  if  the  Muslims  use  their  vote  properly.  ""If  the  next  Labour  government  has  a  reduced  majority  that's  a  great  achievement  because  having  a  very  big  majority  has  been  very  harmful  for  politics  in  this  country,""  Dr  Tamimi  said.

3,"McCall  earns  Tannadice  reprieve  |||    Dundee  United  manager  Ian  McCall  has  won  a  reprieve  from  the  sack,  with  chairman  Eddie  Thompson  calling  for  an  end  to  speculation  over  his  future.  |||    It  is  understood  that  McCall  would  have  been  sacked  if  Sheffield  Wednesday  manager  Paul  Sturrock  had  been  willing  to  return  to  Tannadice.  But  Sturrock  has  distanced  himself  from  the  position.  ""We're  in  a  difficult  situation.  We  must  get  out  of  it  through  the  efforts  of  current  personnel,""  said  Thompson.  ""Ian  McCall  and  I  have  had  a  long  and  detailed  talk  about  a  number  of  areas  including  the  current  league  position  and  the  manner  of  the  exit  from  the  League  Cup,""  he  added.  ""However,  the  continuing  speculation  is  doing  no  one  any  good,  especially  as  we  have  several  crucial  games  coming  up.

1,"Housewives  lift  Channel  4  ratings  |||    The  debut  of  US  television  hit  Desperate  Housewives  has  helped  lift  Channel  4's  January  audience  share  by  12%  compared  to  last  year.  |||    Other  successes  such  as  Celebrity  Big  Brother  and  The  Simpsons  have  enabled  the  broadcaster  to  surpass  BBC  Two  for  the  first  month  since  last  July.  BBC  Two's  share  of  the  audience  fell  from  11.2%  to  9.6%  last  month  in  comparison  with  January  2004.  Celebrity  Big  Brother  attracted  fewer  viewers  than  its  2002  series.  |||    Comedy  drama  Desperate  Housewives  managed  to  pull  in  five  million  viewers  at  one  point  during  its  run  to  date,  attracting  a  quarter  of  the  television  audience.  The  two  main  television  channels,  BBC1  and  ITV1,  have  both  seen  their  monthly  audience  share  decline  in  a  year  on  year  comparison  for  January,  while  Five's  proportion  remained  the  same  at  a  slender  6.3%.  Digital  multi-channel  TV  is  continuing  to  be  the  strongest  area  of  growth,  with  the  BBC  reporting  Freeview  box  ownership  of  five  million,  including  one  million  sales  in  the  last  portion  of  2004.  Its  share  of  the  audience  soared  by  20%  in  January  2005  compared  with  last  year,  and  currently  stands  at  an  average  of  28.6%. "

0,"Further  rise  in  UK  jobless  total  |||    The  UK's  jobless  total  rose  for  the  second  month  in  a  row  in  December,  official  figures  show.  |||    The  number  of  people  out  of  work  rose  32,000  to  1.41  million  in  the  last  three  months  of  2004,  even  as  90,000  more  people  were  in  employment.  Average  earnings  rose  by  4.3%  in  the  year  to  December  up  from  November's  4.2%,  the  Office  for  National  Statistics  (ONS)  added.  Meanwhile,  the  benefit  claimant  total  fell  11,000  to  813,200  last  month.  Throughout  2004,  the  number  of  people  in  work  increased  by  296,000  to  28.52  million  -  the  highest  figure  since  records  began  in  1971.  |||    The  apparent  discrepancy  between  rising  unemployment  and  record  numbers  in  work  can  be  explained  by  an  increase  in  the  working  population  and  a  fall  in  those  who  are  economically  inactive.  While  the  UK's  jobless  rate  rose  to  4.7%  from  4.6%  in  the  previous  quarter,  the  rate  still  remains  one  of  the  lowest  in  the  world,  compared  with  12.1%  in  Germany,  10.4%  in  Spain  and  9.7%  in  France.  But,  despite  more  people  being  in  work,  the  manufacturing  sector  continued  to  suffer,  with  104,000  workers  axed  during  the  last  quarter  of  2004  -  pushing  employment  in  the  sector  to  a  record  low  of  3.24  million  by  the  end  of  last  year.  The  figures  prompted  some  analysts  to  forecast  that  the  Bank  of  England  will  almost  certainly  raise  rates  this  year.  Marc  Ostwald,  a  strategist  at  Monument  Securities  told  Reuters  that  while  no  immediate  market  impact  could  be  expected,  ""it  is  enough  to  underline  that  they  (the  BoE)  will  be  more  hawkish  on  rates"".

3,"Moore  questions  captaincy  |||    Brian  Moore  believes  the  England  captain  should  not  be  a  full-back.  |||    Jason  Robinson  has  led  the  team  during  their  opening  three  defeats  in  the  Six  Nations  tournament,  in  the  absence  of  fly-half  Jonny  Wilkinson.  The  world  champions  have  struggled  since  the  retirement  of  former  captain  Martin  Johnson,  a  lock  forward.  And  former  England  captain  Moore  told  the  BBC:  ""Full-backs  are  too  far  away  from  the  action.  That's  not  a  reflection  on  Robinson  personally.""  He  added:  ""I  just  think  the  point  of  influence  needs  to  move  closer  to  the  pack  -  which  is,  after  all,  where  games  usually  start  and  finish.""  Moore  says  a  lack  of  cohesion  in  the  forwards  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  England  have  lost  against  Wales,  France  and  Ireland  in  this  year's  tournament.  ""Assertiveness  in  the  pack  isn't  there,  we're  not  getting  enough  people  into  the  breakdowns,""  he  explained.  ""Wer'e  not  getting  quick  ball,  which  means  the  backs  are  being  stifled.  Their  creativity  depends  on  quick  ball  and  we're  not  getting  that.""  |||    With  injuries  depriving  him  of  key  players  like  Wilkinson,  coach  Andy  Robinson  has  given  youngsters  such  as  Harry  Ellis  and  Jamie  Noon  a  chance.  And  Moore  believes  the  last  two  games  against  Italy  and  Scotland  are  a  good  opportunity  to  experiment  further.  ""The  problem  is  the  players  that  are  around  to  replace  the  icons  which  have  been  lost  because  of  retirement  and  injury  don't  have  the  requisite  experience,""  Moore  added.  ""You  can't  do  anything  about  that  but  play  them.  There  are  players  who  have  been  knocking  on  the  door,  it's  time  for  them  to  be  looked  at  in  these  last  two  games  because  there's  nothing  on  them.  ""We  then  go  into  next  season  with  a  greater  certainty  of  who  can  and  cannot  handle  the  pressure  of  international  rugby."" "

2,"UK  'needs  true  immigration  data'  |||    A  former  Home  Office  minister  has  called  for  an  independent  body  to  be  set  up  to  monitor  UK  immigration.  |||    Barbara  Roche  said  an  organisation  should  monitor  and  publish  figures  and  be  independent  of  government.  She  said  this  would  counter  ""so-called  independent""  groups  like  Migration  Watch,  which  she  described  as  an  anti-immigration  body  posing  as  independent.  Migration  Watch  says  it  is  not  against  all  immigration  and  the  government  already  publishes  accurate  figures.  Sir  Andrew  Green,  chairman  of  the  organisation,  says  there  is  no  need  for  an  independent  body  because  Office  of  National  Statistics  data  are  accurate.  He  says  he  opposes  large-scale  immigration  ""both  on  the  grounds  of  overcrowding  and  culture"".  |||    He  said:  ""For  example,  over  the  next  20  years  one  household  in  three  will  be  due  to  immigration.  ""We  are  already  more  overcrowded  than  India  and  we  are  four  times  more  overcrowded  than  France.""  Ms  Roche,  Labour  MP  for  Hornsey  and  Wood  Green,  believes  legal  migration  is  something  we  should  welcome.  She  said  her  proposals  mean  ""we  wouldn't  have  so-called  independent  experts,  like  Migration  Watch,  who  come  into  this  debate  from  an  anti-immigration  point  of  view.""  She  went  on:  ""What  I  would  like  to  see  is  there  being  a  body  which  actually  looked  at  the  figures,  published  them,  and  was  independent  of  government.  ""I  think  that  would  go  a  long  way  to  allaying  some  of  the  fears  that  are  sometimes  whipped  up  during  this  debate."" "

0,"Ericsson  sees  earnings  improve  |||    Telecoms  equipment  supplier  Ericsson  has  posted  a  rise  in  fourth  quarter  profits  thanks  to  clients  like  Deutsche  Telekom  upgrade  their  networks.  |||    Operating  profit  in  the  three  months  to  31  December  was  9.5bn  kronor  (£722m;  $1.3bn)  against  6.3bn  kronor  last  year.  Shares  tumbled,  however,  as  the  company  reported  a  profit  margin  of  45.6%,  less  than  the  47.3%  forecast  by  analysts  and  down  from  47.1%  in  the  third  quarter.  Ericsson  shares  dropped  5.9%  to  20.7  kronor  in  early  trading  on  Thursday.  However,  the  company  remained  optimistic  about  its  earnings  outlook  after  sales  in  the  fourth  quarter  rose  9%  to  39.4bn  kronor.  ""Long-term  growth  drivers  of  the  industry  remain  solid,""  Ericsson  said  in  a  statement.  |||    Chief  executive  Carl-Henric  Svanberg  explained  that  about  ""27%  of  the  world's  population  now  has  access  to  mobile  communications"".  ""This  is  exciting  for  a  company  with  a  vision  of  an  all-communicating  world,""  he  added.  Mr  Svanberg,  however,  warned  that  the  extra  demand  that  had  driven  2004  sales  had  already  dissipated  and  it  was  ""business  as  usual"".  He  added  that  sales  in  the  first  three  months  of  2005  would  be  subject  to  ""normal  seasonality"".  For  the  whole  of  2004,  Ericsson  returned  a  net  profit  of  19bn  kronor,  compared  with  a  loss  of  10.8bn  kronor  in  2003.  Sales  climbed  to  131.9  billion  kronor  from  117.7bn  kronor  in  2003. "

2,"Election  'could  be  terror  target'  |||    Terrorists  might  try  to  target  the  UK  in  the  run-up  to  the  election,  London's  most  senior  police  officer  has  said.  |||    Sir  Ian  Blair  said  terror  groups  would  remember  the  effect  of  the  Madrid  bomb  on  Spain's  general  election  last  year.  Other  potential  targets  were  the  royal  wedding  and  the  UK's  presidency  of  the  European  Union  and  G8,  he  said.  He  refused  to  say  if  there  was  specific  information  about  the  risk  of  a  pre-poll  attack.  No  10  was  similarly  cautious  but  said  the  threat  was  real.  |||    The  comments  come  after  Tony  Blair  defended  his  controversial  anti-terror  proposals,  warning  that  it  would  be  wrong  to  wait  for  an  attack  before  acting.  Sir  Ian  told  a  meeting  of  the  Metropolitan  Police  Authority  it  would  be  ""unwise""  to  speculate  about  whether  there  was  specific  information  about  risks  of  a  pre-election  attack.  But  he  said:  ""Terrorists  have  long  memories.  They  understand  what  happened  in  Madrid  and  know  what  the  impact  of  that  was  on  the  Spanish  electorate.  |||    ""This  year  we  are  responsible  for  the  EU  presidency,  presidency  of  the  G8,  a  royal  wedding  and  a  general  election.  ""There  are  obvious  and  enormous  targets  which  we  have  to  deal  with.""  Sir  Ian  said  the  debate  over  anti-terror  plans  was  one  for  politicians,  not  the  police,  who  would  enforce  any  new  powers.  |||    Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  has  also  warned  that  a  Madrid-style  pre-election  bombing  could  happen  in  the  UK  too.  Asked  about  Sir  Ian's  comments,  the  prime  minister's  official  spokesman  said:  ""We  believe  the  threat  is  real.""  The  spokesman  declined  to  comment  on  whether  the  security  services  had  received  specific  intelligence  relating  to  a  possible  attack  during  the  election  campaign.  He  said  No  10  did  not  disclose  any  security  advice  they  received.  Earlier,  writing  in  the  Daily  Telegraph,  the  prime  minister  conceded  that  plans  to  detain  suspects  under  house  arrest  without  trial  were  ""difficult  issues  for  any  government"".  The  Commons  has  approved  the  measures  despite  considerable  opposition,  with  the  government's  majority  more  than  halved  as  32  Labour  rebels  joined  Tory  and  Lib  Dem  opposition.  But  Mr  Blair  insisted:  ""There  is  no  greater  civil  liberty  than  to  live  free  from  terrorist  attack.""  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  has  accused  Mr  Blair  of  steamrolling  the  house  arrest  plans  and  of  ""using  national  security  for  political  point  scoring"".  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  says  that  the  plan  is  a  further  example  of  Labour's  ""authoritarian""  response  to  crises.  The  Prevention  of  Terrorism  Bill  proposes  ""control  orders"",  which  as  well  as  house  arrest  could  impose  curfews,  tagging  or  bans  on  telephone  and  internet  use.  They  would  replace  current  powers  to  detain  foreign  terror  suspects  without  trial,  which  the  law  lords  have  ruled  against.  But  critics  are  concerned  that  it  would  be  the  home  secretary  and  not  judges  who  decided  to  impose  control  orders.  The  plans  face  further  Commons  scrutiny  on  Monday  before  passing  to  the  Lords. "

0,"Nasdaq  planning  $100m  share  sale  |||    The  owner  of  the  technology-dominated  Nasdaq  stock  index  plans  to  sell  shares  to  the  public  and  list  itself  on  the  market  it  operates.  |||    According  to  a  registration  document  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  Nasdaq  Stock  Market  plans  to  raise  $100m  (£52m)  from  the  sale.  Some  observers  see  this  as  another  step  closer  to  a  full  public  listing.  However  Nasdaq,  an  icon  of  the  1990s  technology  boom,  recently  poured  cold  water  on  those  suggestions.  |||    The  company  first  sold  shares  in  private  placements  during  2000  and  2001.  It  technically  went  public  in  2002  when  the  stock  started  trading  on  the  OTC  Bulletin  Board,  which  lists  equities  that  trade  only  occasionally.  Nasdaq  will  not  make  money  from  the  sale,  only  investors  who  bought  shares  in  the  private  placings,  the  filing  documents  said.  The  Nasdaq  is  made  up  shares  in  technology  firms  and  other  companies  with  high  growth  potential.  It  was  the  most  potent  symbol  of  the  1990s  internet  and  telecoms  boom,  nose-diving  after  the  bubble  burst.  A  recovery  in  the  fortunes  of  tech  giants  such  as  Intel,  and  dot.com  survivors  such  as  Amazon  has  helped  revive  its  fortunes. "

1,"Glastonbury  fans  to  get  ID  cards  |||    Fans  who  buy  tickets  for  this  year's  Glastonbury  festival  will  be  issued  with  photo  ID  cards  in  an  attempt  to  beat  touts,  it  has  been  confirmed.  |||    The  cards  will  include  a  photograph  of  the  ticket-holder  plus  an  electronic  chip  with  their  details  to  prevent  tickets  being  sold  on  or  forged.  Tickets  for  the  June  event  are  expected  to  go  on  sale  in  April.  ""There  is  only  one  place  in  the  world  where  you  will  be  able  to  get  tickets,""  festival  organiser  Michael  Eavis  said.  ""That  will  be  the  official  source.  If  you  get  them  anywhere  else,  you  won't  get  in.""  Fans  not  wanting  to  carry  the  entrance  card  could  present  their  passport  or  driving  licence  instead,  he  added.  |||    More  than  153,000  people  are  expected  to  travel  to  Mr  Eavis'  Somerset  farm  from  24-26  June,  but  the  event's  rising  popularity  has  meant  an  extremely  high  demand  for  tickets  in  recent  years.  When  the  ID  card  idea  was  floated,  Mr  Eavis'  daughter  Emily  said  it  would  be  ""quite  a  big  step  in  terms  of  ticketing  for  events""  if  implemented  and  they  were  ""going  as  far  as  we  can""  to  cut  touting.  ""As  long  as  it's  approached  in  the  right  way,  it  might  really  work,  it  might  really  change  the  system,""  she  said.  In  2004,  all  112,000  tickets  for  the  public  sold  out  in  24  hours.  They  were  personalised  with  the  names  of  purchasers,  who  were  asked  to  bring  identification,  such  as  a  driving  licence,  passport  or  household  bill.  But  some  forgot  to  take  the  right  information  while  some  touts  simply  offered  to  supply  their  own  bills  along  with  the  ticket  bearing  their  name.  No  details  of  this  year's  line-up  have  been  confirmed  but  rumours  have  suggested  U2  and  Coldplay  may  be  among  the  headliners. "

2,"Labour  pig  poster  'anti-Semitic'  |||    The  Labour  Party  has  been  accused  of  anti-Semitism  over  a  poster  depicting  Michael  Howard  and  Oliver  Letwin  -  who  are  both  Jewish  -  as  flying  pigs.  |||    Prospective  Tory  candidate  Andrew  Mennear,  whose  Finchley  constituency  contains  a  large  Jewish  community,  branded  it  ""tasteless""  and  offensive.  The  poster  shows  the  two  men's  faces  superimposed  on  winged  pigs  and  says  ""the  day  the  Tory  sums  add  up"".  Labour  said  the  poster  was  ""not  anti-Jewish,  but  anti-Tory"".  |||    It  is  one  of  four  designs  e-mailed  to  Labour  members,  who  were  asked  to  vote  for  their  favourite.  Mr  Mennear,  who  was  sent  the  e-mail  by  a  friend,  said  he  had  been  ""shocked""  by  the  image  and  had  shown  it  to  friends  who  were  similarly  horrified.  He  said  there  was  nothing  more  distasteful  for  a  Jewish  person  than  to  be  associated  with  a  pig.  ""I  am  not  suggesting  there  is  any  deliberate  intent,  but  these  sort  of  things  can  cause  great  offence.  It  clearly  wasn't  thought  through.  ""It  is  possible  the  posters  were  designed  for  maximum  impact,  but  this  one  clearly  overstepped  the  mark  and  should  be  withdrawn.""  |||    The  campaign  was  particularly  insensitive  as  it  had  come  out  at  the  same  time  as  Holocaust  Day,  a  ""difficult""  time  for  many  Jewish  people,  Mr  Mennear  added.  A  Labour  spokesman  denied  the  campaign  was  anti-Semitic.  ""As  we  said  at  the  time  the  James  report  (the  Tory  backed  inquiry  into  possible  public  spending  savings)  was  published  pigs  will  fly  before  the  Tory's  sums  will  add  up.  This  poster  is  making  a  serious  point,""  he  said.

It  topped  the  charts  in  the  US  and  UK,  raising  millions  of  dollars  for  African  famine  relief.  The  re-release  also  marks  the  20th  anniversary  of  the  original  recording.  It  has  been  re-issued  as  part  of  a  two-disc  DVD  set,  which  will  also  feature  footage  from  the  recording  session  of  the  track  in  January  1985.  The  single  was  originally  released  in  the  US  on  7  March  1985  and  sold  800,000  copies  in  its  first  week.  It  went  on  to  win  Grammys  for  song  of  the  year  and  record  of  the  year. "

As  a  result,  the  2.5  billion  people  in  the  developing  world  who  rely  on  farming  face  food  insecurity.  The  most  endangered  are  those  who  live  in  the  least-developed  countries.  The  FAO  report  said  that  support  for  farmers  in  industrialised  nations  was  equivalent  to  30  times  the  amount  provided  as  aid  for  agricultural  development  in  poor  countries.  |||    The  FAO  has  urged  the  World  Trade  Organisation  to  swiftly  conclude  negotiations  to  liberalise  trade,  easing  developing  countries'  access  to  the  world  market.  It  also  criticised  the  high  tariffs  imposed  by  both  developed  and  developing  nations.  It  recommends  that  developing  countries  reduce  their  own  tariffs  to  encourage  trade  and  take  advantage  of  market  liberalisation.  |||    According  to  the  organisation,  subsidies  and  high  tariffs  have  a  strong  impact  on  the  trade  of  products  such  as  cotton  and  rice.  Global  exports  of  these  products  are  mainly  in  the  hands  of  the  European  Union  and  the  US,  who  -  thanks  to  subsidies  -  sell  them  at  very  low  prices.  In  fact,  almost  30  wealthy  nations  spend  more  than  $300bn  (£158.8bn;  230.9bn  euros)  in  agricultural  subsidies.  The  market  situation  has  divided  developing  nations  in  two  groups,  the  FAO  said.  The  first  group  have  a  reasonably  diverse  range  of  agricultural  products  while  in  the  second  group,  agriculture  lies  largely  in  the  hands  of  small-scale  producers.  For  43  developing  countries,  more  than  20%  of  their  export  incomes  come  from  the  sale  of  just  one  product.  These  countries  are  mainly  situated  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean. "

0,"Mixed  signals  from  French  economy  |||    The  French  economy  picked  up  speed  at  the  end  of  2004,  official  figures  show  -  but  still  looks  set  to  have  fallen  short  of  the  government's  hopes.  |||    According  to  state  statistics  body  INSEE,  growth  for  the  three  months  to  December  was  a  seasonally-adjusted  0.7-0.8%,  ahead  of  the  0.6%  forecast.  If  confirmed,  that  would  be  the  best  quarterly  showing  since  early  2002.  It  leaves  GDP  up  2.3%  for  the  full  year,  but  short  of  the  2.5%  which  the  French  government  had  predicted.  |||    Despite  the  apparent  shortfall  in  annual  economic  growth,  the  good  quarterly  figures  -  a  so-called  ""flash  estimate""  -  mark  a  continuing  trend  of  improving  indicators  for  the  health  of  the  French  economy.  The  government  is  reiterating  a  2.5%  target  for  2005,  while  the  European  Central  Bank  is  making  positive  noises  for  the  12-nation  eurozone  as  a  whole.  Also  on  Friday,  France's  industrial  output  for  December  was  released,  showing  0.7%  growth.  ""The  numbers  are  good,""  said  David  Naude,  economist  at  Deutsche  Bank.  ""They  send  a  positive  signal  of  a  rebound  in  output...  and  open  the  way  for  a  continuation  in  that  trend  into  the  New  Year.""  Service  sector  activity  improved  in  January,  hitting  a  seven-month  high.  But  unemployment  remains  high  at  about  10%. "

2,"Economy  focus  for  election  battle  |||    Britain's  economic  future  will  be  at  the  heart  of  Labour's  poll  campaign,  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  has  said.  |||    He  was  speaking  after  Cabinet  members  held  their  last  meeting  at  No  10  before  the  expected  election  announcement.  He  said  voters  would  recognise  that  Labour  had  brought  stability  and  growth,  and  would  continue  to  do  so.  Meanwhile  the  Tories  outlined  their  plans  to  tackle  ""yob  culture""  and  the  Lib  Dems  gave  more  details  about  their  proposals  to  replace  council  tax.  Earlier  the  Archbishop  of  Canterbury  wrote  to  all  three  parties  urging  them  not  to  fight  the  election  by  exploiting  people's  fears.  |||    In  an  open  letter,  he  called  on  them  not  to  turn  the  election  into  a  competition  about  who  can  most  effectively  frighten  voters  about  terrorism,  asylum,  and  crime.  He  said  they  should  concentrate  instead  on  issues  such  as  the  environment,  international  development  and  the  arms  trade,  family  policy,  and  the  reform  of  the  criminal  justice  system.  |||    Shadow  foreign  secretary  Michael  Ancram  said:  ""We  have  fought  a  very  positive  campaign.  I  think  he  will  want  to  look  quite  carefully  at  what  Jack  Straw  said  about  Michael  Howard.""  |||    In  a  speech  to  the  Foreign  Policy  Centre  Mr  Straw  said  of  the  Tory  leader:  ""He  is  clever,  fluent  and  tactical,  but  he  is  not  wise.  ""He  lacks  strategy  and  good  judgment,  and  his  quick  temper  and  impetuosity  too  often  get  the  better  of  him.""  The  Foreign  Secretary  told  the  BBC:  ""I  was  making  the  observation  that  because  of  Michael  Howard's  impetuosity  you  can  get  lurches  of  policy.""  Liberal  Democrat  chairman  Matthew  Taylor  said:  ""People  are  already  really  turned  off  by  the  kind  of  campaign  the  others  are  fighting  and  you  will  see  us  putting  emphasis  on  some  of  these  huge  issues  facing  the  world,  particularly  the  environment.""  |||    Labour's  focus  on  the  economy  as  their  key  message  -  came  on  the  day  a  new  report  was  published  by  the  Institute  of  Fiscal  Studies,  suggesting  that  household  incomes  have  fallen  for  the  first  time  in  more  than  a  decade.  The  IFS  says  the  drop  partly  reflects  measures  announced  in  what  it  called  the  Chancellor's  tax-raising  Budget  of  2002.  The  Treasury  dismissed  the  research  as  ""complete  rubbish"".  Party  election  supremo  Alan  Milburn  said  the  apparent  drop  in  average  incomes  was  because  self-employed  people  had  been  affected  by  a  ""world  downturn""  which  hit  their  profits.  Since  1997,  the  reported  average  take-home  income  had  ""risen  by  20%  in  real  terms""  if  you  took  out  the  self-employed,  Mr  Milburn  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  Mr  Brown  also  dismissed  the  figures  insisting  that  the  ""typical  family""  has  been  much  better  off  under  Labour. "

0,"Call  to  overhaul  UK  state  pension  |||    The  UK  pension  system  has  been  branded  inadequate  and  too  complex  by  a  leading  retirement  think-tank.  |||    The  Pensions  Policy  Institute  (PPI)  said  replacing  the  state  pension  with  a  ""citizen's  pension""  would  help  tackle  inequality  and  complexity.  The  change  would  see  pensions  being  calculated  on  length  of  residency  in  the  UK  rather  than  National  Insurance  (NI)  contributions.  Reform  could  reduce  poverty  by  aiding  people  with  broken  employment  records.  |||    The  PPI  added  that  once  the  state  system  was  reformed  the  government  should  look  at  options  to  overhaul  private  and  workplace  pensions.  The  think  tank's  proposals  were  made  in  response  to  the  recent  publication  of  the  Pensions  Commission's  initial  report  into  UK  retirement  savings.  According  to  the  Pensions  Commission's  report  12  million  working  people  are  not  saving  enough  for  their  retirement.  As  a  result,  living  standards  could  fall  for  the  next  generation  of  UK  pensioners.  The  report  added  that  a  combination  of  higher  taxes,  higher  savings  and/or  a  higher  average  retirement  age  was  needed  to  solve  the  UK  pension  crisis. "

1,"Poppins  musical  gets  flying  start  |||    The  stage  adaptation  of  children's  film  Mary  Poppins  has  had  its  opening  night  in  London's  West  End.  |||    Sir  Cameron  Mackintosh's  lavish  production,  which  has  cost  £9m  to  bring  to  the  stage,  was  given  a  10-minute  standing  ovation.  Lead  actress  Laura  Michelle  Kelly  soared  over  the  heads  of  the  audience  holding  the  nanny's  trademark  umbrella.  Technical  hitches  had  prevented  Mary  Poppins'  flight  into  the  auditorium  during  preview  performances.  A  number  of  celebrities  turned  out  for  the  musical's  premiere,  including  actress  Barbara  Windsor,  comic  Graham  Norton  and  Sir  Richard  Attenborough.  |||    The  show's  director  Richard  Eyre  issued  a  warning  earlier  in  the  week  that  the  show  was  unsuitable  for  children  under  seven,  while  under-threes  are  barred.  Mary  Poppins  was  originally  created  by  author  Pamela  Travers,  who  is  said  to  have  cried  when  she  saw  Disney's  1964  film  starring  Julie  Andrews.  Travers  had  intended  the  story  to  be  a  lot  darker  than  the  perennial  family  favourite.  Theatre  impresario  Sir  Cameron  Mackintosh  has  said  he  hopes  the  musical  is  a  blend  of  the  sweet-natured  film  and  the  original  book. "

2,"England  children's  tsar  appointed  |||    The  first  children's  commissioner  for  England  has  been  appointed.  |||    Great  Ormond  Street  Hospital  professor  of  child  health,  Al  Aynsley-Green,  was  chosen  by  the  government  and  will  start  the  £100,000-a-year  job  immediately.  He  will  oversee  a  £2.5m  annual  budget  and  have  the  power  to  look  into  ""any  matter  relating  to  the  interests  and  well-being  of  children"".  Prof  Aynsley-Green  has  also  been  the  national  clinical  director  for  children  in  the  Department  of  Health.  He  promised  to  make  sure  that  children's  opinions  ""count"".  |||    ""I  will  be  drawing  on  my  experience  of  working  with  children  and  young  people  to  help  ensure  that  those  with  the  power  to  improve  children's  lives  do  live  up  to  their  responsibilities.  ""I  want  all  children  and  young  people  to  know  that  they  can  approach  me  to  discuss  any  matter  that  affects  them,  knowing  that  I  will  value  their  opinion.""  Education  Secretary  Ruth  Kelly  said  Prof  Aynsley-Green  would  ""strengthen  the  voice  of  children  and  young  people"".  Prof  Aynsley-Green  was  a  lecturer  at  Oxford  University,  trained  at  Guy's  Hospital  Medical  School,  University  of  London;  Oriel  College,  Oxford;  and  in  Switzerland.  He  is  described  as  ""a  proud  grandfather""  of  four.  Scotland,  Wales  and  Northern  Ireland  already  have  children's  commissioners. "

2,"Labour's  'EU  propaganda'  |||    A  ""taxpayer  subsidised  propaganda  exercise""  on  the  EU  is  being  used  to  lull  the  British  public  into  a  false  sense  of  security,  say  the  Tories.  |||    Shadow  foreign  secretary  Michael  Ancram  told  MPs  a  new  White  Paper  was  part  of  trying  to  soften  up  opinion  ahead  of  the  referendum  on  the  EU  constitution.  His  claims  were  denied  by  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw,  who  accused  the  Tories  of  ""running  scared""  of  debate.  EU  cooperation  would  help  get  better  UK  immigration  controls,  he  argued.  |||    Mr  Straw  used  Thursday's  Commons  debate  to  launch  the  new  White  Paper  on  the  prospects  for  the  EU  in  2005.  Security,  stability  and  prosperity  would  be  the  key  themes  when  the  UK  took  over  the  chairmanship  of  the  EU  in  July,  said  Mr  Straw.  Africa  and  climate  change  would  also  feature  highly.  He  said  the  UK  was  trying  to  ensure  future  EU  budgets  were  limited  to  1%  of  Europe's  economic  output  and  were  spent  ""where  it  adds  most  value"".  Mr  Straw  promised  to  continue  to  ensure  the  UK's  budget  rebate,  secured  in  1984  by  Margaret  Thatcher,  was  ""fully  justified"".  ""We,  like  all  other  countries,  have  a  veto  on  any  changes  proposed  in  this  area,""  he  said.  |||    Mr  Ancram  condemned  the  document,  which  the  Foreign  Office  says  has  cost  about  £2,500  to  design,  print  and  deliver.  ""Isn't  the  reason  that  the  government  is  now  involved  in  a  taxpayer  subsidised  propaganda  exercise  to  try  to  sell  the  new  EU  to  the  country  in  advance  of  the  forthcoming  referendum  and  general  election?,""  he  asked.  The  Tory  spokesman  also  criticised  the  government  for  claiming  the  EU  constitution  would  make  Europe  easier  to  understand.  ""The  government,  last  week,  had  to  publish  a  commentary  of  500  pages  to  try  and  explain  this  'easy  and  simple'  constitution  to  the  British  people,""  he  said.  ""Who  are  they  trying  to  kid?""  The  proposed  question  for  the  constitution  referendum  is:  ""Should  the  United  Kingdom  approve  the  Treaty  establishing  a  Constitution  for  the  European  Union?""  The  Electoral  Commission  on  Thursday  said  it  was  satisfied  the  question  was  easy  to  understand.  The  government  has  suggested  the  referendum  on  the  constitution  could  take  place  in  spring  2006,  with  the  Tories  set  to  campaign  for  a  ""no""  vote.  |||    Mr  Ancram  said  ministers  were  prolonging  uncertainty  by  putting  the  vote  off  until  the  latest  date  possible.  The  foreign  secretary  hit  back  by  saying  Tory  attitudes  to  Europe  had  helped  keep  the  party  out  of  power  for  more  than  a  decade.  Mr  Straw  argued  cooperation  with  European  partners  could  bring  a  ""level  playing  field""  on  immigration  and  asylum  controls.  ""You  are  setting  your  face  against  all  of  these  things,""  he  added.  For  the  Liberal  Democrats,  Sir  Menzies  Campbell  said  the  UK  should  not  ignore  the  need  to  reform  the  EU  Common  Agricultural  Policy.  Change  was  particularly  important  for  developing  countries  wanting  access  to  markets,  he  argued.  Sir  Menzies  was  among  those  worried  about  plans,  backed  by  the  UK,  to  lift  the  arms  embargo  imposed  on  China  after  the  Tiananmen  Square  massacre.  Mr  Straw  said  no  decisions  had  been  taken  -  Chinese  human  rights  had  improved  but  not  by  enough. "

0,"UK  bank  seals  South  Korean  deal  |||    UK-based  bank  Standard  Chartered  said  it  would  spend  $3.3bn  (£1.8bn)  to  buy  one  of  South  Korea's  main  retail  banks.  |||    Standard  Chartered  said  acquiring  Korea  First  Bank  (KFB)  fulfilled  a  strategic  objective  of  building  a  bigger  presence  in  Asia's  third  largest  economy.  Its  shares  fell  nearly  3%  in  London  as  the  bank  raised  funds  for  the  deal  by  selling  new  stocks  worth  £1bn  ($1.8bn),  equal  to  10%  of  its  share  capital.  Standard  Chartered  expects  about  16%  of  future  group  revenue  to  come  from  KFB.  |||    The  South  Korean  bank  will  also  make  up  22%  of  the  group's  total  assets.  The  move,  a  year  after  Citigroup  beat  Standard  Chartered  to  buy  Koram  bank,  would  be  the  South  Korean  financial  sector's  biggest  foreign  takeover.  This  time  around,  Standard  Chartered  is  thought  to  have  beaten  HSBC  to  the  deal.  KFB  is  South  Korea's  seventh  largest  bank,  with  3  million  retail  customers,  6%  of  the  country's  banking  market  and  an  extensive  branch  network.  |||    The  country's  banking  market  is  three  times  the  size  of  Hong  Kong's  with  annual  revenues  of  $44bn.  Standard  Chartered  has  its  headquarters  in  London  but  does  two  thirds  of  its  business  in  Asia,  and  much  of  the  rest  in  Africa.  ""We're  comfortable  with  the  price  paid...the  key  here  has  been  speed  and  decisiveness  in  making  sure  that  we  won,""  said  Standard  Chartered  chief  executive  Mervyn  Davies  at  a  London  press  conference.  Standard  Chartered  said  KFB  was  a  ""well-managed,  conservatively  run  bank  with  a  highly  skilled  workforce""  and  represented  a  ""significant  acquisition  in  a  growth  market"".  In  London,  Standard  Chartered's  sale  of  118  million  new  shares  to  institutional  investors  pushed  its  share  price  down,  and  contributing  to  the  FTSE  100's  0.3%  decline.  Standard  Chartered's  shares  were  28  pence  lower  at  925p  by  midday.  Some  analysts  also  queried  whether  Standard  Chartered  had  overpaid  for  KFB.  The  deal,  which  requires  regulatory  approval,  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  April  2005  and  to  be  earnings  accretive  in  2006,  Standard  Chartered  said.  |||    Rival  banking  giant  HSBC,  which  is  based  in  London  and  Hong  Kong,  was  also  in  the  running.  Standard  Chartered  is  believed  to  have  gained  the  initiative  by  putting  together  a  bid  during  the  Christmas  break.  ""They  were  able  to  move  so  quickly  it  caught  HSBC  by  surprise,""  the  Financial  Times  newspaper  quoted  an  insider  in  the  talks  as  saying.  HSBC  will  now  have  to  wait  for  the  next  South  Korean  bank  in  line  to  be  sold  off  -  thought  likely  to  be  Korea  Exchange  Bank,  also  currently  in  the  hands  of  a  US  group.  Standard  Chartered  said  it  was  buying  100%  of  KFB,  an  agreement  that  would  bring  an  end  to  the  bank's  complex  dual  ownership.  The  South  Korean  government  owns  51.4%  of  KFB,  while  the  remaining  shareholding,  and  operational  control,  are  in  the  hands  of  US  private  equity  group  Newbridge  Capital.  Newbridge  bought  its  stake  during  the  government's  nationalisation  of  several  banks  in  the  wake  of  the  1997  Asia-wide  currency  crisis  which  crippled  South  Korea's  financial  institutions.  |||    South  Korea's  economy  is  expected  to  grow  by  4.5%  this  year.  Although  often  thought  of  an  export-driven  economy,  South  Korea's  service  sector  has  overtaken  manufacturing  in  the  last  decade  or  so.  Services  now  make  up  roughly  40%  of  the  economy,  and  consumer  spending  and  retail  banking  have  become  increasingly  important.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  the  government  encouraged  the  growth  of  consumer  credit.  Bad  loan  problems  followed;  LG  Card,  the  country's  biggest  credit  card  provider,  has  been  struggling  to  avoid  bankruptcy  for  months,  for  instance.  But  analysts  believe  South  Korea's  financial  services  industry  is  still  in  its  infancy,  offering  plenty  of  scope  for  new  products.  Standard  Chartered  sees  ""the  opportunity  to  create  value  by  the  introduction  of  more  sophisticated  banking  products"".  Since  1999,  KFB  has  been  restructured  from  a  wholesale  bank  into  a  retail  bank  focused  on  mortgage  lending,  which  makes  up  45%  of  its  loans. "

0,"Jobs  go  at  Oracle  after  takeover  |||    Oracle  has  announced  it  is  cutting  about  5,000  jobs  following  the  completion  of  its  $10.3bn  takeover  of  its  smaller  rival  Peoplesoft  last  week.  |||    The  company  said  it  would  retain  more  than  90%  of  Peoplesoft  product  development  and  product  support  staff.  The  cuts  will  affect  about  9%  of  the  55,000  staff  of  the  combined  companies.  Oracle's  18-month  fight  to  acquire  Peoplesoft  was  one  of  the  most  drawn-out  and  hard-fought  US  takeover  battles  of  recent  times.  The  merged  companies  are  set  to  be  a  major  force  in  the  enterprise  software  market,  second  only  in  size  to  Germany's  SAP.  |||    In  a  statement,  Oracle  said  it  began  notifying  staff  of  redundancies  on  Friday  and  the  process  would  continue  over  the  next  10  days.  ""By  retaining  the  vast  majority  of  Peoplesoft  technical  staff,  Oracle  will  have  the  resources  to  deliver  on  the  development  and  support  commitments  we  have  made  to  Peoplesoft  customers  over  the  last  18  months,""  Oracle's  chief  executive  Larry  Ellison  said  in  a  statement.  |||    Correspondents  say  6,000  job  losses  had  been  expected  -  and  some  suggest  more  cuts  may  be  announced  in  future.  They  say  Mr  Ellison  may  be  trying  to  placate  Peoplesoft  customers  riled  by  Oracle's  determined  takeover  strategy.  Hours  before  Friday's  announcement,  there  was  a  funereal  air  at  Peoplesoft's  headquarters,  reported  AP  news  agency.  A  Peoplesoft  sign  had  been  turned  into  shrine  to  the  company,  with  flowers,  candles  and  company  memorabilia.  ""We're  mourning  the  passing  of  a  great  company,""  the  agency  quoted  Peoplesoft  worker  David  Ogden  as  saying.  Other  employees  said  they  would  rather  be  sacked  than  work  for  Oracle.  ""The  new  company  is  going  to  be  totally  different,""  said  Anil  Aggarwal,  Peoplesoft's  director  of  database  markets.  ""Peoplesoft  had  an  easygoing,  relaxed  atmosphere.  Oracle  has  an  edgy,  aggressive  atmosphere  that's  not  conducive  to  innovative  production.""  On  the  news,  Oracle  shares  rose  15  cents  -  1.1%  -  on  Nasdaq.  In  after-hours  trading  the  shares  did  not  move. "

0,"Firms  pump  billions  into  pensions  |||    Employers  have  spent  billions  of  pounds  propping  up  their  final  salary  pensions  over  the  past  year,  research  suggests.  |||    A  survey  of  280  schemes  by  Incomes  Data  Services'  (IDS)  said  employer  contributions  had  increased  from  £5.5bn  to  £8.2bn  a  year,  a  rise  of  49.7%.  Companies  facing  the  biggest  deficits  had  raised  their  pension  contributions  by  100%  or  more,  IDS  said.  Many  firms  are  struggling  to  keep  this  type  of  scheme  open,  because  of  rising  costs  and  increased  liabilities.  A  final  salary  scheme,  also  known  as  a  defined  benefit  scheme,  promises  to  pay  a  pension  related  to  the  salary  the  scheme  member  is  earning  when  they  retire.  |||    The  rising  cost  of  maintaining  such  schemes  has  led  many  employers  to  replace  final  salary  schemes  with  money  purchase,  or  defined  contribution,  schemes.  These  are  less  risky  for  employers.  Under  money  purchase  schemes,  employees  pay  into  a  pension  fund  which  is  used  to  buy  an  annuity  -  a  policy  which  pays  out  an  income  until  death  -  on  retirement.  |||    IDS  said  there  were  some  schemes  in  good  health.  |||    But,  in  many  cases,  firms  had  been  forced  to  top  up  funds  to  tackle  ""yawning  deficits"".  The  level  of  contributions  paid  by  employers  has  increased  gradually  since  the  late  1990s.  In  1998/99,  for  example,  contributions  rose  by  4.7%  and  in  2002/03  by  8.6%.  In  contrast,  between  1996  and  1998,  some  employers  cut  their  contribution  levels.  Helen  Sudell,  editor  of  the  IDS  Pensions  Service,  said  the  rise  in  contributions  was  ""staggering""  and  the  highest  ever  recorded  by  IDS.  ""We  have  warned  before  that  the  widespread  closure  of  final  salary  schemes  to  new  entrants  is  just  the  beginning  of  a  much  bigger  movement  away  from  paternalistic  provision,""  said  Ms  Sudell.  ""With  figures  like  this  there  can  be  little  doubt  that  many  employers  will  have  to  reduce  future  benefits  at  some  point  for  those  staff  still  in  these  schemes."" "

2,"Blair  looks  to  election  campaign  |||    Tony  Blair's  big  speech  will  be  looked  back  on  as  the  performance  that  kicked  off  the  election  campaign.  |||    That  poll  may  still  be  about  16  weeks  away,  but  there  can  be  little  doubt  left  that  the  campaign  is  now  in  full  swing.  The  prime  minister  used  his  speech  to  a  selected  audience  in  the  south  east  to  set  out  his  broad  brush  election  manifesto.  There  was  a  detailed  account  of  the  government's  past  record,  with  a  major  emphasis  on  the  economy  and  public  services.  There  was  an  attempt  to  draw  the  line  under  the  gossip  surrounding  his  rift  with  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown.  And  there  was  an  insistence  on  the  importance  of  the  party  continuing  to  operate  as  unremittingly  ""New""  Labour  -  although  that  may  continue  to  irritate  his  chancellor.  |||    There  was  little  in  terms  of  concrete  proposals  or  what  might  form  manifesto  pledges,  although  the  prime  minister  talked  about  a  ""New  Labour  manifesto  that  will  be  aimed  at  all  sections  of  society"".  His  was  more  a  speech  designed  to  remind  people,  and  some  in  his  own  party,  precisely  what  New  Labour  stood  for,  and  to  leave  them  in  no  doubt  there  would  not  be  any  shrinking  away  from  that  approach.  And,  for  some,  that  means  showing  that  New  Labour  actually  does  stand  for  something  -  that  it  is,  as  he  said,  more  than  ""an  electoral  device"".  |||    To  that  end  he  set  out  a  broad  programme  aimed  to  appeal  to  both  middle  England  voters  who  switched  to  the  party  in  1997  and  stuck  with  it,  possibly  through  some  gritted  teeth,  in  2001,  and  to  more  traditional  lower  income  old  Labour  supporters.  In  a  key  section,  he  declared:  ""In  our  third  term  we  can  achieve  an  unprecedented  widening  of  opportunity  and  prosperity.  ""For  the  first  time  ever  a  whole  generation  growing  up  with  unbroken  economic  stability.  Every  family  -  not  just  the  fortunate  few  -  knowing  their  children  will  have  an  inheritance  at  adulthood.  ""Every  pupil  in  every  secondary  school  guaranteed  a  place  in  university  or  a  quality  apprenticeship.  Every  adult  -  including  those  who  missed  out  at  school  -  able  to  get  the  skills  then  need  to  advance.  ""Home  ownership  extended  to  its  highest  ever  level  and  to  families  who  have  never  before  been  able  to  afford  it.  ""The  highest  ever  level  of  employment  with  everyone  in  work  guaranteed  a  decent  wage  and  decent  conditions"".  |||    Under  what  is  to  be  the  general  election  slogan  ""Britain  is  working"",  the  prime  minister  time  and  again  insisted  the  future  direction  would  be  unremittingly  New  Labour.  That  might  get  under  the  skin  of  Mr  Brown,  but  he  also  heaped  praise  on  him  as  the  most  successful  post-war  chancellor  Britain  has  had.  Probably  the  greatest  ideological  divide  between  the  two  men,  in  so  far  as  there  is  one,  is  about  the  degree  of  private  finance  allowed  into  the  public  services.  |||    An  unremittingly  ""New""  Labour  manifesto,  as  the  prime  minister  is  happy  to  make  plain,  will  stress  the  importance  of  that  -  the  belief  patients  and  parents,  for  example,  want  a  choice  of  good  services  before  they  start  worrying  about  who  has  provided  them.  The  chancellor  is  said  to  be  far  more  sceptical  about  private  finance,  although  there  is  no  suggestion  he  opposes  it  in  principle.  With  an  election  looming  the  next  big  speech  from  Gordon  Brown  will  be  closely  examined  for  any  signs  of  divisions  and,  in  particular,  the  use  of  that  little  three  letter  word.  But  for  now,  all  eyes  have  been  focused  on  the  next  general  election.  And  for  many  in  Westminster,  Mr  Blair's  performance  has  only  succeeded  in  hardening  the  belief  that  will  be  on  5  May. "

2,"MPs  tout  Lords  replacement  plan  |||    A  group  of  MPs  has  tried  to  raise  the  pressure  on  Tony  Blair  over  reform  to  the  House  of  Lords  by  publishing  a  detailed  blueprint  for  change.  |||    The  cross-party  group  has  unveiled  a  draft  bill  proposing  a  smaller  second  chamber  in  which  70%  of  members  would  be  elected.  MPs  and  peers  have  failed  to  agree  on  reform  since  1999  when  600  hereditaries  lost  their  seats.  The  group  says  it  can  win  support  for  removing  the  last  92  hereditaries.  The  government  postponed  plans  to  remove  the  remaining  hereditary  peers  because  they  said  they  were  unlikely  to  succeed  after  opposition  in  the  Lords.  Tony  Blair  has  argued.  there  needs  to  be  consensus  on  reforms.  There  have  been  suggestions  there  will  be  proposals  for  changing  at  least  the  powers  of  the  Lords  in  Labour's  manifesto.  |||    But  the  all-party  group,  including  Tories  Ken  Clarke  and  Sir  George  Young,  Labour's  Robin  Cook  and  Tony  Wright  and  Liberal  Democrat  Paul  Tyler,  is  confident  its  plan  would  win  support  from  a  ""large  majority"".  And  they  list  former  Conservative  leader  William  Hague  and  former  Labour  leader  Neil  Kinnock  as  supporters  of  the  plans.  The  group  says  the  British  public  and  a  clear  majority  of  MPs  support  replacing  the  Lords  with  a  largely-elected  second  chamber.  Their  plan  would  see  the  House  of  Lords  being  renamed  the  Second  Chamber  of  Parliament,  and  its  members  would  be  known  as  MSCPs.  |||    There  would  be  385  MSCPs,  including  270  elected  members,  87  appointed  members  and  16  bishops.  They  would  serve  for  between  12  and  14  years.  Mr  Cook  said  holding  elections  for  MSCPs  on  the  same  day  as  those  for  MPs  might  help  motivate  the  electorate  and  increase  voter  turnout.  He  added:  ""Over  the  last  year  I  have  seen  many  statements  from  senior  figures  of  this  government  insisting  the  public  must  have  the  right  of  choice.  ""What  could  be  more  important  than  a  choice  of  the  people  who  sit  in  our  Parliament?""  |||    The  group  believes  pressure  is  growing  for  change  and  the  government's  current  position  is  unsustainable.  It  wants  all  three  main  parties  to  include  a  commitment  to  a  ""largely  democratic""  second  chamber  in  their  manifestos.  Mr  Clarke  said  the  issue  ""went  to  the  heart  of  reforming  the  health  of  the  British  political  system"".  And  Mr  Tyler  said  the  prime  minister's  view  that  there  was  no  agreement  on  the  shape  of  the  future  of  the  Lords  was  flawed.  ""The  problem,  I  think,  in  the  prime  minister's  mind  is  there  doesn't  appear  to  be  a  consensus  that  includes  him,""  he  said.  ""We  are  providing  a  consensus"".  The  Elect  the  Lords  Campaign  said  the  draft  bill  was  an  important  contribution  to  the  debate.  ""We  believe  this  draft  bill  is  detailed  enough  to  form  the  basis  of  closer  parliamentary  scrutiny,""  said  co-ordinator  Peter  Facey.  ""In  lieu  of  any  other  such  clear  proposals,  the  government  must  permit  that  to  happen."" "

1,"Abba  reunite  for  musical  premiere  |||    The  original  stars  of  Swedish  pop  quartet  Abba  have  reunited  for  the  home  premiere  of  hit  musical  Mamma  Mia!  which  is  based  on  the  band's  songs.  |||    It  is  the  first  time  in  almost  20  years  that  the  four,  Bjorn  Ulvaeus,  Benny  Andersson,  Agnetha  Faltskog  and  Anni-Frid  Lyngstad,  have  met  publicly.  Faltskog  has  been  a  virtual  recluse  since  the  band  split  up  in  1982.  The  musical,  which  has  become  a  global  phenomenon,  will  be  performed  in  Swedish  for  the  first  time.  Fans  camped  outside  Stockholm's  Cirkus  theatre  in  the  snow  for  a  glimpse  of  the  stars.  The  premiere  marks  Abba's  first  public  reunion  since  the  legendary  band's  acrimonious  break-up  in  the  early  1980s.  It  was  thought  that  Faltskog  would  appear  in  London  for  the  musical's  fifth  anniversary  celebrations  in  April  2004  but  she  stayed  away  due  to  her  fear  of  flying.  |||    Original  Abba  member  Bjorn  Ulvaeus  set  about  translating  the  musical  into  the  band's  mother  tongue  for  the  celebrated  homecoming,  alongside  Swedish  artist  Niklas  Stromstedt.  Almost  all  of  Abba's  original  songs,  which  have  sold  more  than  350  million  records  worldwide,  were  written  and  recorded  in  English.  The  musical,  set  on  a  small  Greek  island,  tells  of  the  story  of  a  young  woman  and  her  fiercely  independent  single  mother.  The  show  will  include  such  classics  as  Super  Trouper,  SOS  and  Dancing  Queen.  There  are  currently  14  productions  being  staged  worldwide,  including  New  York  and  London,  with  road  shows  in  Toronto,  South  Korea  and  Madrid.  More  than  20  million  people  around  the  world  have  seen  the  show. "

0,"Ukraine  strikes  Turkmen  gas  deal  |||    Ukraine  has  agreed  to  pay  30%  more  for  natural  gas  supplied  by  Turkmenistan.  |||    The  deal  was  sealed  three  days  after  Turkmenistan  cut  off  gas  supplies  in  a  price  dispute  that  threatened  the  Ukrainian  economy.  Supplies  from  Turkmenistan  account  for  45%  of  all  natural  gas  imported  by  Ukraine,  which  has  large  coal  deposits  but  no  gas  fields.  Turkmenistan  is  also  trying  to  strike  a  similar  deal  with  Russia,  which  is  not  so  dependent  on  its  gas.  Turkmen  President  Saparmurat  Niyazov,  who  signed  the  contract,  said  the  Turkmen  side  agreed  to  lower  the  price  demanded  by  $2  per  1,000  cubic  metres,  bringing  it  down  to  $58.  But  the  new  price  is  still  $14  higher  than  the  price  fixed  in  the  contract  for  2004.  The  head  of  the  Ukrainian  state-owned  Naftohaz  company,  Yury  Boyko,  said  he  was  ""fully  happy""  with  the  deal.  On  Friday,  Turkmenistan  acted  on  a  threat  and  shut  off  gas  supplies  to  Ukraine  in  attempt  to  bring  the  price  dispute  to  a  head.  Mr  Niyazov  said  that  his  government  would  insist  on  the  same  price  for  supplies  to  Russia.  Analysts  say  thay  may  not  happen  as  Russia,  the  world's  leading  gas  producer,  needs  the  cheap  Turkmen  gas  only  to  relieve  is  state-owned  Gazprom  from  costly  investment  in  the  exploration  of  oil  fields  in  Siberia.  Turkmenistan  is  the  second-largest  gas  producer  in  the  world. "

2,"UK  helps  raped  Rwandan  women  |||    Britain  is  to  give  a  £4m  grant  to  help  women  survivors  of  the  Rwandan  genocide  who  were  raped  and  often  deliberately  infected  with  HIV/Aids.  |||    An  estimated  25,000  girls  and  women  were  raped  during  the  1994  genocide.  About  800,000  Tutsis  and  moderate  Hutus  were  killed  by  Hutu  militias  after  the  assassination  of  an  ethnic  Hutu  leader.  The  five-year  Department  for  International  Development  funding  will  enable  more  survivors  to  have  access  to  anti-retroviral  treatment.  |||    The  plight  of  the  infected  women  was  overshadowed  for  a  long  time.  It  was  overshadowed  by  Rwanda's  emergence  from  the  100  days  of  slaughter,  during  which  time  the  mass  killings  took  place,  and  the  women's  fate  was  largely  a  taboo  subject.  But  many  of  the  women  were  widowed  and  they  now  not  only  have  their  own  children  to  care  for  but,  in  many  cases,  orphans  too.  |||    As  the  women  die,  the  number  of  Rwanda's  orphans  rises.  Until  recently,  very  few  of  the  women  have  had  access  to  anti-retroviral  treatment.  That  is  now  starting  to  change.  This  funding  is  intended  to  make  anti-retrovirals  and  other  care  available  for  some  2,500  women.  Mary  Kayitesi  Blewitt,  founder  of  the  Survivors  Fund  (SURF),  one  of  the  organisations  through  which  the  funds  are  being  channelled,  said  it  was  a  recognition,  before  it  was  too  late,  that  the  survivors  should  be  a  priority  for  help.

1,"UK  'world's  biggest  music  buyer'  |||    UK  consumers  are  the  biggest  music  buyers  in  the  world,  according  to  new  figures  released  on  Tuesday  by  the  British  Phonographic  Industry  (BPI).  |||    But  global  sales  of  recorded  music  were  flat  in  2004,  with  growing  sales  in  DVD  music  videos  offset  by  online  and  physical  piracy  in  major  markets.  The  UK  music  industry  recorded  an  overall  3%  increase  in  volume  sales,  mostly  due  to  its  robust  albums  market.  However,  world  music  sales  declined  by  1.3%  to  $33.6  billion  (£17.7  billion).  The  UK  CD  albums  market  grew  by  4.5%  in  2004  with  a  record  174.6  million  units  sold.  On  average  every  Briton  buys  3.2  CDs  per  person  per  year.  |||    Around  26,000  albums  are  released  in  the  UK  each  year,  making  Britain  second  only  to  the  US  in  terms  of  the  number  of  releases.  Overall  sales  were  driven  by  new  UK-signed  artists  such  as  Keane,  Katie  Melua  and  Scissor  Sisters,  whose  debut  album  sold  almost  1.6  million  copies  in  the  UK.  ""A  slew  of  great  new  British  artists  have  met  UK  music  fans'  demand  for  great  music,""  said  BPI  chairman  Peter  Jameson.  The  best-selling  album  globally  was  Usher's  Confessions  -  one  of  eight  albums  to  sell  more  than  five  million  copies  in  2004.  |||    The  growth  in  the  DVD  market  and  a  sharp  increase  in  sales  of  digital  music  ensured  a  strong  market  in  the  US.  The  total  number  of  tracks  downloaded  last  year  were  up  more  than  tenfold  on  2003.  Digital  sales  in  the  US  in  the  first  two  months  of  2005  are  already  more  than  double  that  of  the  same  period  in  2004.  |||    However,  some  markets  in  Continental  Europe  and  Asia  -  notably  Sweden,  Finland,  France,  Spain  and  South  Korea  -  have  been  drastically  hit  by  internet  piracy.  Australia,  Italy  and  the  Netherlands  also  saw  a  decline.  ""On  the  positive  side  digital  sales  are  booming,""  said  John  Kennedy,  chief  executive  of  the  International  Federation  of  Phonographic  Industries  (IFPI).  ""However,  commercial  piracy  and  illegal  file-sharing  are  continuing  to  depress  our  markets.  ""The  priority  in  the  coming  year  is  to  step  up  the  advance  of  legitimate  digital  sales  and  sustain  our  anti-piracy  efforts.""  ""The  main  choice  today's  music  fan  now  has  to  make  is  whether  to  get  music  legally  or  illegally,""  added  Mr  Jameson. "

0,"Arsenal  'may  seek  full  share  listing'  |||    Arsenal  vice-chairman  David  Dein  has  said  the  club  may  consider  seeking  a  full  listing  for  its  shares  on  the  London  Stock  Exchange.  |||    Speaking  at  the  Soccerex  football  business  forum  in  Dubai,  he  said  a  full  listing  was  ""one  of  the  options""  for  funding  after  the  club  moves  to  its  new  stadium.  The  club  -  which  is  currently  listed  on  the  smaller  Ofex  share  exchange  -  is  due  to  move  into  its  new  60,000-seater  Emirates  Stadium  at  Ashburton  Grove  for  the  start  of  the  2006/07  season.  Mr  Dein  also  warned  the  current  level  of  TV  coverage  of  the  Premiership  may  be  reaching  saturation  level,  with  signs  that  match  attendances  have  been  dropping  off  in  the  first  few  months  of  this  season.  |||    When  Arsenal  moves  to  its  new  stadium  it  will  see  its  proportion  of  turnover  from  media  earnings  drop  from  52%  this  season  to  34%  in  two  years'  time.  The  club  is  hoping  to  increase  matchday  earnings  from  29%  to  40%  of  turnover,  and  has  not  ruled  out  other  money-earning  means,  including  a  full  share  listing.  ""When  the  new  stadium  opens  we  will  go  through  a  thorough  financial  review,""  Mr  Dein  said.  |||    ""Listing  would  be  one  option,  but  we  are  flexible  and  no  decisions  have  been  made  on  that  issue  yet.  ""We  want  to  be  in  the  best  financial  health  -  maybe  clubs  can  do  it  (listing),  Manchester  United  have  been  a  success.""  |||    Mr  Dein  said  that,  although  television  money  and  coverage  had  driven  the  English  game  forward  in  the  past  10  years,  he  feared  there  might  now  be  too  many  games  being  shown.  Since  the  formation  of  the  Premier  League  in  season  1992/93,  Premiership  clubs  have  seen  their  income  from  television  soar.  ""Television  has  been  the  driving  force  over  the  past  10  years...  but  we  must  constantly  improve  if  we  want  to  remain  as  the  world's  leading  league  competition.  ""We  must  monitor  the  quality  of  the  product  and  ensure  attendances  do  not  decline,  and  we  must  balance  that  with  the  quantity  of  exposure  on  TV  too.  ""I  think  we  have  practically  reached  saturation  point...  sometimes  I  think  less  is  more.""  |||    The  club  is  funding  its  move  to  Ashburton  Grove  through  a  number  of  sources,  including  debt  from  banks,  from  money  it  already  has  and  will  receive  in  coming  years  from  sponsors,  and  from  the  sale  of  surplus  property,  including  its  Highbury  Stadium.  It  is  also  looking  to  create  new  revenue  streams  from  overseas  markets,  including  Asia.  ""We  have  two  executives  travelling  round  Japan  and  China  at  the  moment  building  relationships  with  organisations  and  clubs,  and  we  know  our  supporters  clubs  are  growing  there  too,  as  they  are  around  the  world.  ""We  have  got  a  very  good  product,  so  it  is  very  important  we  go  and  look  at  these  markets,  and  make  sure  we  are  on  the  case."" "

2,"Howard  backs  stem  cell  research  |||    Michael  Howard  has  backed  stem  cell  research,  saying  it  is  important  people  are  not  frightened  of  the  future.  |||    The  controversial  issue  was  a  feature  of  the  recent  US  presidential  election,  where  George  Bush  opposed  extending  it.  But  the  Tory  leader  argued  there  was  a  moral  case  for  embracing  science  which  could  help  victims  of  Alzheimer's,  Parkinson's  and  Motor  Neurone  disease.  ""I  believe  we  have  a  duty  to  offer  hope  to  the  millions  of  people  who  suffer  devastating  illnesses,""  he  said.  The  use  of  embryonic  stem  cells  in  the  UK  is  already  allowed.  Stem  cells  are  master  cells  that  have  the  ability  to  develop  into  any  of  the  body's  tissue  types.  Scientists  hope  that  by  growing  such  cells  in  the  laboratory  they  can  programme  them  to  form  specific  tissue  such  as  kidney,  heart  or  even  brain  tissue.  |||    Mr  Howard  acknowledged  there  were  genuine  concerns  about  stem  cell  research.  But  he  argued:  ""We  mustn't  be  frightened  of  change  or  nostalgic  about  the  past  -  we  must  be  optimistic  about  the  future.  ""Politicians  must  create  the  right  framework  so  that  the  great  potential  of  science  can  be  harnessed  for  the  benefit  of  mankind.  ""With  the  life  expectancy  of  the  average  Briton  now  around  the  mid-70s,  society  has  a  responsibility  to  enhance  the  quality  of  people's  lives  as  they  grow  older.  ""I  know  many  people  are  concerned  about  stem-cell  research.  They  are  fearful  of  meddling  with  what  they  see  as  the  stuff  of  souls.  ""I  respect  those  concerns.  But  I  also  believe  we  have  a  duty  to  offer  hope  to  the  millions  of  people  who  suffer  devastating  illnesses  like  Parkinson's,  Multiple  Sclerosis,  Motor  Neurone  Disease,  Alzheimer's  and  -  as  we  saw  in  the  papers  today  -  now  possibly  heart  problems.""  |||    Mr  Howard  acknowledged  there  were  ""no  easy  answers""  over  such  an  issue  but  it  was  necessary  to  ""have  the  courage  to  do  what  we  know  to  be  morally  right"".  He  added:  ""Of  course,  stem  cells  are  still  a  recent  discovery.  More  research  needs  to  be  done.  But  we  must  look  at  their  potential  in  a  responsible  and  grown-up  way.  The  hopes  of  millions  of  people  rest  on  what  could  be  achieved.""  Former  Superman  actor  the  late  Christopher  Reeve  was  an  advocate  for  the  research  after  he  was  paralysed  in  a  horse  riding  accident.  Mr  Howard  made  his  remarks  during  a  speech  in  Westminster  to  the  Conservative  National  Women's  Committee  on  ambitions  and  values. "

2,"Brown  targets  OAPs  and  homebuyers  |||    Gordon  Brown  has  doubled  the  level  at  which  house  buyers  pay  stamp  duty  to  £120,000  as  he  put  the  economy  at  the  heart  of  Labour's  election  campaign.  |||    The  chancellor  also  unveiled  a  one-off  £200  council  tax  refund  for  pensioners  and  a  rise  in  child  tax  credit.  Mr  Brown  put  1p  a  pint  on  beer,  4p  on  a  bottle  of  wine  and  7p  on  20  cigarettes  but  froze  petrol  duty  until  September.  The  Tories  called  it  a  ""vote  now,  pay  later""  Budget.  The  Lib  Dems  branded  it  a  ""sticking  plaster""  for  the  election.  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  predicted  the  Budget  would  do  nothing  to  help  Labour's  ""faltering""  election  campaign.  |||    ""This  government  and  this  chancellor  have  run  out  of  solutions  to  the  problems  Britain  faces,""  Mr  Howard  told  MPs.  ""Their  only  answer  is  to  tax,  to  spend  and  to  waste  -  to  get  people  to  vote  now  and  pay  later.""  He  ended  his  response  with  an  election  challenge  to  Labour,  saying  ""bring  it  on"".  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  attacked  Mr  Brown  for  failing  to  mention  the  environment  and  for  his  record  on  social  justice.  ""How  can  it  be  right  in  Britain  today  that  the  poorest  20%  pay  more  in  tax,  as  a  proportion  of  their  income,  than  the  richest  20%?""  he  asked.  |||    Mr  Kennedy  criticised  Mr  Brown  for  failing  to  mention  the  ""ticking  bomb""  of  council  tax  revaluation,  saying  it  was  ""high  time""  the  system  was  replaced  by  a  ""local  tax  based  on  the  ability  to  pay"".  During  his  49  minute  speech  Mr  Brown  told  MPs  he  had  defied  the  pundits  by  hitting  his  growth  target  of  3.1%  for  2004.  |||    He  said  his  Budget  struck  a  balance  ""between  tax  cuts  that  are  affordable,  investments  that  are  essential  and  stability  that  is  paramount"".  He  rejected  across-the-board  tax  cuts  in  favour  of  targeted  help  for  families.  The  child  tax  credit  will  rise  in  line  with  earnings,  giving  families  an  extra  £5  a  week.  In  contrast,  the  personal  income  tax  allowance  will  rise  only  in  line  with  inflation  from  £4,745  to  £4,895  next  month.  Mr  Brown  told  MPs  child  benefit  would  rise  to  a  maximum  of  £63  a  week  for  the  first  child  and  £111  for  two  children.  Despite  his  giveaways,  Budget  documents  show  Mr  Brown  clawed  back  £265m  through  a  clampdown  on  tax  avoidance  and  increased  revenue  from  a  windfall  tax  on  oil  companies.  He  also  scrapped  stamp  duty  relief  for  commercial  property  in  disadvantaged  areas  -  a  measure  brought  in  just  over  three  years  ago.  BBC  political  editor  Andrew  Marr  suggested  the  sweeteners  were  not  big  enough  to  have  a  transforming  effect  on  voters.  But  trust  in  Mr  Brown's  economic  stewardship  would  be  a  central  election  issue,  he  said.  |||    Mr  Brown  also  unveiled  plans  for  a  memorial  to  the  Queen  Mother,  funded  through  a  special  coin  to  celebrate  the  Queen's  80th  birthday.  Other  measures  include  equal  tax  status  for  same-sex  couples  and  a  deal  with  the  Council  of  Mortgage  Lenders  to  boost  low  cost  home  ownership.  The  level  where  people  start  paying  inheritance  tax  will  also  rise  from  £263,000  to  £275,000  from  April.  Mr  Brown  said  he  had  met  his  financial  ""golden  rule""  with  a  £6bn  surplus  and  he  said  public  borrowing  would  continue  to  fall  over  the  next  five  years.  |||    The  economy  had  grown  for  50  consecutive  quarters,  he  said,  and  was  forecast  to  continue  doing  so  over  the  next  year,  with  a  forecast  of  3%  to  3.5%  in  2005  and  2.5%  to  3%  in  2006.  The  first  £2bn  of  value-for-money  savings  identified  in  the  Gershon  Review  have  been  achieved,  the  chancellor  said.  Some  12,500  civil  servant  posts  have  been  axed,  and  7,800  relocated  out  of  the  south  east  of  England,  he  added.  SNP  leader  Alex  Salmond  said  Mr  Brown  had  failed  the  ""tartan  test""  as  there  were  no  measures  to  boost  the  Scottish  economy.  Simon  Thomas,  of  Plaid  Cymru,  called  it  a  budget  for  Middle  England.  UK  Independence  Party  leader  Roger  Knapman  attacked  the  plans  for  pensioners  saying  they  needed  ""more  money  and  the  dignity  of  being  allowed  to  spend  it  how  they  want,""  not  ""free  bus  rides"".  The  Green  Party  said  the  Budget  was  a  ""wasted  opportunity""  for  environmental  protection,  adding:  ""Brown  obviously  has  an  eye  on  the  coming  election,  and  has  taken  his  eye  off  the  needs  of  the  planet."" "

2,"Tsunami  'won't  divert  Africa  aid'  |||    UK  aid  to  help  the  victims  of  the  Asian  tsunami  disaster  will  not  take  much  needed  relief  from  Africa,  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  has  promised.  |||    Mr  Blair  told  the  BBC's  Breakfast  with  Frost  show  the  money  spent  on  the  tsunami  would  not  ""invade""  the  money  Britain  wanted  to  spend  on  Africa.  Questioned  about  the  disaster,  he  said  his  faith  in  God  had  not  been  shaken.  He  added  he  would  give  new  figures  on  the  number  of  tsunami-related  British  deaths  to  the  Commons  on  Monday.  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  said  on  Friday  that  about  440  Britons  were  either  dead  or  missing  in  the  disaster.  |||    Mr  Blair  told  Sunday's  programme:  ""Since  Jack  Straw  gave  those  figures  a  couple  of  days  ago  they  haven't  moved  a  great  deal,  which  should  give  us  some  hope  that  we  are  beginning  to  reach  the  peak  of  the  numbers.  But  we  just  can't  be  sure.  ""It  is  just  an  immensely  difficult  job  to  get  absolutely  accurate  figures,  all  countries  are  struggling  with  this.""  |||    He  said  the  £50  million  originally  allocated  from  the  Department  for  International  Development  was  now  ""well  on  the  way""  to  being  spent.  But  the  exact  allocation  could  not  be  clarified  until  the  World  Bank  had  completed  its  assessment  of  the  needs  of  the  countries  affected.  Within  the  next  few  weeks  a  clearer  picture  would  emerge  of  the  long-term  costs  of  reconstruction,  he  added.  But  he  pledged  that  Africa  -  which  sees  a  ""preventable""  tsunami-size  death  toll  every  month  from  conflict,  disease  and  poverty  -  would  not  be  neglected.  As  Britain  takes  up  its  presidency  of  the  G8  group  of  leading  nations,  Mr  Blair  said  ministers  had  a  big  agenda  for  Africa.  ""For  the  first  time  we  have  a  plan  that  won't  just  deal  with  aid  and  debt  but  will  also  deal  on  issues  of  governance  within  African  countries  and  conflict  resolution,""  he  said.  ""A  lot  of  the  problems  in  Africa  come  from  conflict,  that  again  are  preventable,  but  only  with  the  right  systems  in  place."" "

1,"Jarre  joins  fairytale  celebration  |||    French  musician  Jean-Michel  Jarre  is  to  perform  at  a  concert  in  Copenhagen  to  mark  the  bicentennial  of  the  birth  of  writer  Hans  Christian  Andersen.  |||    Denmark  is  holding  a  three-day  celebration  of  the  life  of  the  fairy-tale  author,  with  a  concert  at  Parken  stadium  on  2  April.  Other  stars  are  expected  to  join  the  line-up  in  the  coming  months,  and  the  Danish  royal  family  will  attend.  ""Christian  Andersen's  fairy  tales  are  timeless  and  universal,""  said  Jarre.  ""For  all  of  us,  at  any  age  there  is  always  -  beyond  the  pure  enjoyment  of  the  tale  -  a  message  to  learn.""  There  are  year-long  celebrations  planned  across  the  world  to  celebrate  Andersen  and  his  work,  which  includes  The  Emperor's  New  Clothes  and  The  Little  Mermaid.  Denmark's  Crown  Prince  Frederik  and  Crown  Princess  Mary  visited  New  York  on  Monday  to  help  promote  the  festivities.  The  pair  were  at  a  Manhattan  library  to  honour  US  literary  critic  Harold  Bloom  ""the  international  icon  we  thought  we  knew  so  well"".  |||    ""Bloom  recognizes  the  darker  aspects  of  Andersen's  authorship,""  Prince  Frederik  said.  Bloom  is  to  be  formally  presented  with  the  Hans  Christian  Andersen  Award  this  spring  in  Anderson's  hometown  of  Odense.  The  royal  couple  also  visited  the  Hans  Christian  Anderson  School  complex,  where  Queen  Mary  read  The  Ugly  Duckling  to  the  young  audience.  Later  at  a  gala  dinner,  Danish  supermodel  Helena  Christensen  was  named  a  Hans  Christian  Andersen  ambassador.  Other  ambassadors  include  actors  Harvey  Keitel  and  Sir  Roger  Moore,  athlete  Cathy  Freeman  and  Brazilian  soccer  legend  Pele. "

2,"Lib  Dems  demand  new  inquiry  |||    A  judge  should  look  into  the  David  Blunkett  controversy  as  key  questions  remain  unanswered,  the  Lib  Dems  say.  |||    Sir  Alan  Budd's  inquiry  linked  the  ex-home  secretary  to  the  speeding  up  of  a  visa  claim  by  his  ex-lover's  nanny.  But  he  could  not  say  whether  Mr  Blunkett  had  treated  the  nanny  as  a  special  case  or  had  used  her  as  an  example  of  immigration  problems.  Lib  Dem  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  said  the  number  of  officials  who  had  forgotten  what  happened  was  worrying.  He  told  BBC  News:  ""I'm  extremely  concerned  that  20  individuals  appear  to  have  forgotten  what  happened  or  more  suspiciously  are  not  prepared  to  say  what  happened.  ""That  must  be  bad  for  government,  it  must  be  bad  for  public  confidence  in  the  system.""  |||    Mr  Oaten  said  people  would  be  mystified  why  Sir  Alan's  inquiry  failed  to  uncover  why  processing  of  the  visa  application  was  speeded  up.  He  said:  ""There  is  a  strong  case  for  a  judge-led  judicial  review  of  this  because,  of  course,  next  time  it  happens  it  may  not  be  about  a  nanny  and  their  visa.  It  may  be  about  something  even  more  important  than  that.  ""So  we  do  need  to  understand  what  took  place  and  who  was  involved.""  The  Tories  criticised  the  Lib  Dem  stance,  saying  Mr  Oaten  had  initially  said  he  accepted  Mr  Blunkett's  word  unless  further  evidence  emerged.  But  Lib  Dem  officials  say  Mr  Oaten  was  speaking  when  an  inquiry  was  under  way  and  was  avoiding  rushing  to  judgement. "

0,"Italy  to  get  economic  action  plan  |||    Italian  Prime  Minister  Silvio  Berlusconi  will  unveil  plans  aimed  at  kickstarting  the  country's  sputtering  economy  on  Thursday  night  in  Rome.  |||    He  will  present  an  ""Action  Plan  for  the  Development  of  Italy""  in  a  meeting  with  industrialists  and  trade  union  leaders.  Mr  Berlusconi  is  expected  to  table  reforms  aimed  at  boosting  research  and  development  (R&D)  spending,  and  the  competitiveness  of  small  firms.  Also  in  focus  will  be  bankruptcy  laws  and  the  slow  pace  of  the  legal  system.  The  prime  minister  is  scheduled  to  start  the  meeting  at  1830  GMT.  |||    The  government  has  been  accused  of  underfunding  R&D,  making  it  harder  for  Italy  to  compete  with  other  European  nations  and  leading  to  a  ""brain-drain""  of  the  country's  brightest  talents.  Analysts  say  that  hiring  and  firing  staff  is  still  too  difficult  and  expensive,  hampering  the  development  of  small-  and  medium-sized  businesses.  As  a  result,  they  say,  Italy's  corporate  landscape  is  filled  with  numerous  smaller  companies  that  are  often  reluctant  to  become  bigger  because  of  all  the  extra  hassle  that  would  accompany  the  running  of  a  larger  firm.  At  the  same  time,  bankruptcy  laws  make  it  difficult  for  failed  company  directors  to  set  up  new  businesses  and  emerge  from  their  debts,  a  situation  that  is  hampering  Italy's  entrepreneurial  spirit.  |||    The  government  says  that  it  has  set  about  tackling  the  problems,  adding  that  getting  growth  going  was  the  responsibility  of  all  of  Italy's  60  million  population.  According  to  Il  Sole  24  Ore,  Italy's  business  newspaper,  the  government  will  focus  on  ""opening  up  markets,  infrastructure,  research,  making  more  incentives  available,  bankruptcy  law,  the  slow  pace  of  the  justice  system"".  |||    Mr  Berlusconi  has  previously  promised  to  cut  taxes  by  6.5bn  euros  ($8.6bn;  £4.5bn)  this  year  in  an  effort  to  get  people  and  companies  to  spend.  He  has  also  promised  to  cap  spending  on  transport,  education  and  health  so  as  to  trim  the  ballooning  budget  deficit.  Italy  plans  to  raise  as  much  as  25bn  euros  from  privatisations  in  2005,  including  a  partial  flotation  of  the  post  office  and  utility  Enel.  Critics  argue  that  these  moves  do  not  go  far  enough  and  could  make  Italy's  problems  worse.  Limiting  government  spending  will  lead  to  job  losses,  they  counter,  while  the  income  tax  cuts  will  have  a  negligible  effect  on  sentiment  and  ultimately  favour  the  wealthy.  |||    The  country  has  been  one  of  the  eurozone's  worst  economic  performers  in  recent  years.  Growth  was  1.1%  in  2004,  up  from  just  0.3%  in  2003  and  0.4%  in  2002  -  an  improvement  but  still  a  long  way  from  ideal.  At  the  same  time,  business  and  consumer  confidence  has  dipped  and  analysts  have  raised  concerns  that  what  little  spending  there  is  stems  from  Italians  dipping  into  their  savings  accounts  or  using  credit  cards.  Without  a  pick  up  in  national  growth,  they  say,  the  money  could  eventually  run  out,  bringing  Italy's  economy  to  a  juddering  halt.  Consumer  spending  accounts  for  about  two-thirds  of  Italy's  economy. "

2,"Tory  leader  'cleared'  over  work  |||    Scottish  Conservative  Party  leader  David  McLetchie  claims  he  has  been  cleared  over  a  potential  conflict  of  interest.  |||    The  Edinburgh  MSP  earns  up  to  £30,000  a  year  from  the  law  firm  Tods  Murray,  where  he  is  a  partner.  Mr  McLetchie  said  he  has  taken  advice  from  Holyrood  officials  about  what  details  he  needs  to  declare.  He  was  advised  to  exercise  judgement  to  avoid  the  perception  of  a  conflict  and  said  he  had  done  nothing  wrong.  As  an  MSP,  Mr  McLetchie  signed  a  parliamentary  motion  questioning  expansion  plans  for  Edinburgh  Airport.  |||    It  then  emerged  Tods  Murray  has  a  client  which  opposes  the  development.  Mr  McLetchie  then  sought  guidance  from  the  standards  committee  to  clarify  his  position.  BBC  Scotland's  political  correspondent  Glenn  Campbell  said  no  complaint  had  been  made  against  Mr  McLetchie,  but  questions  were  raised  about  his  dual  role.  Glenn  said  MSPs  are  advised  to  guard  against  a  conflict  of  interests  and  a  perception  of  a  conflict.  |||    Mr  McLetchie  said:  ""I'm  quite  clear  that  no  conflicts  of  interest  arise  in  my  case,  that  the  judgement  I  took  has  effectively  been  vindicated  when  you  look  at  the  advice  that  has  been  given  to  me  and  that  these  allegations  are  unfounded.""  He  said  nothing  had  changed  in  respect  of  his  work  with  the  law  firm  and  it  was  a  matter  he  would  have  to  discuss  with  the  other  partners  at  Tods  Murray.  ""The  firm  and  I  have  a  very  good  working  relationship  and  we  have  done  for  the  last  six  years,""  said  Mr  McLetchie.  ""I  don't  suppose  I'll  be  working  forever  as  a  lawyer  or  a  politician.  I  deserve  to  retire  from  both,  but  I'm  not  willing  to  put  time  limits  on  them."" "

1,"Rock  star  sued  by  ex-girlfriend  |||    Motley  Crue  guitarist  Mick  Mars  is  being  sued  by  his  ex-girlfriend  for  $10  million  (£5.4  million),  claiming  he  broke  a  promise  to  take  care  of  her.  |||    The  woman,  Robin  Mantooth,  said  Mars  promised  her  repeatedly  that  he  would  provide  financial  support  in  the  event  of  the  couple  breaking  up.  When  they  split  in  December,  Mantooth  says  Mars  denied  any  such  agreement.  She  is  asking  a  Los  Angeles  court  to  award  her  half  the  musician's  property,  a  monthly  allowance  and  damages.  Mantooth  added  that  the  pair  became  lovers  in  1990,  after  which  she  abandoned  her  career  as  a  documentary  film-maker  to  move  in  with  the  guitarist  at  his  Malibu  home.  |||    She  is  also  claiming  that  Mars,  53,  has  failed  to  provide  her  with  any  material  support  since  they  ceased  to  be  a  couple.  Motley  Crue  recently  reunited  after  being  apart  for  a  period  of  five  years.  They  originally  formed  in  the  early  1980s  and  scored  six  hits  in  the  UK,  including  Girls  Girls  Girls  in  1987.  They  are  embarking  on  a  world  tour  later  this  year  which  will  take  in  60  cities  across  the  US,  Europe,  Asia  and  Australia.  Mars  -  real  name  Bob  Allen  Deal  -  underwent  hip  replacement  surgery  in  October.  He  suffers  from  a  degenerative  rheumatic  disease  which  causes  ligaments  and  tendons  to  attach  to  the  bone. "

2,"Army  chiefs  in  regiments  decision  |||    Military  chiefs  are  expected  to  meet  to  make  a  final  decision  on  the  future  of  Scotland's  Army  regiments.  |||    A  committee  of  the  Army  Board,  which  is  made  up  of  the  most  senior  defence  figures,  will  discuss  plans  for  restructuring  regiments  on  Monday.  The  proposals  include  cutting  Scotland's  six  single-battalion  regiments  to  five  and  merging  these  into  a  super  regiment.  The  plans  have  faced  stiff  opposition  from  campaigners  and  politicians  alike.  The  committee's  decision  must  be  ratified  by  Defence  Secretary  Geoff  Hoon  and  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair.  It  is  expected  that  it  will  be  made  public  next  week.  When  ministers  announced  a  reorganisation  of  the  Army  it  drew  a  question  mark  over  the  futures  of  the  Black  Watch,  the  Kings  Own  Scottish  Borderers,  the  Royal  Scots,  the  Royal  Highland  Fusiliers  and  the  Argyll  and  Sutherland  Highlanders.  In  October,  the  Council  of  Scottish  Colonels  proposed  the  merger  of  the  Royal  Scots  and  the  King's  Own  Scottish  Borderers  into  a  single  battalion.  |||    Under  their  vision,  it  would  be  one  of  five  in  the  new  super  regiment.  The  proposals  to  either  merge  or  amalgamate  the  six  regiments  into  a  super  regiment  sparked  a  political  outcry,  with  Labour  backbenchers  and  opposition  politicians  opposing  the  plan.  They  felt  the  timing  was  insensitive  because  the  Black  Watch  was  in  the  frontline  in  Iraq,  suffering  casualties.  The  Save  the  Scottish  Regiments  campaigners  were  so  angered  they  threatened  to  stand  against  Labour  at  the  next  general  election.  |||    Speaking  ahead  of  the  expected  Army  Board  meeting,  a  spokesman  said:  ""The  government  and  the  Army  Board  have  spent  the  past  four  months  attempting  to  trick  serving  soldiers  and  the  public  into  thinking  their  planned  changes  for  the  Scottish  regiments  are  for  the  good  of  the  Army  and  for  that  of  the  serving  soldier.  ""They  are  very  much  not  for  the  good  and  will  destroy  Scotland's  regiments  by  moulding  them  into  a  single  super  regiment  which  will  lead  to  severe  recruitment  problems,  a  loss  of  local  connections  to  those  regiments  and  a  loss  to  Scotland  of  an  important  part  of  her  heritage  and,  most  importantly,  her  future  -  the  regiments  are  the  envy  of  armies  around  the  world.""  An  alternative  blueprint  had  been  put  forward  by  Labour  MP  Eric  Joyce,  who  proposed  going  ahead  with  the  merger  while  preserving  the  other  regiments.  For  a  brief  time,  there  was  speculation  the  prime  minister  might  consider  the  plan,  but  that  now  seems  unlikely.  Speaking  in  Scotland  last  week,  Mr  Blair  said  the  aim  was  to  preserve  tradition  but  introduce  a  more  effective  structure  and  hinted  that  a  super  regiment  was  likely.  He  said:  ""They  don't  want  to  get  rid  of  the  history  or  the  traditions  of  the  regiment  or  the  local  connections  -  far  from  it,  all  they  want  to  do  is  make  sure  they  can  transfer  people  easily  across  regiments  and  deploy  them  more  flexibly.""  The  prime  minister  said  he  hoped  campaigners'  concerns  would  be  taken  into  account  but  the  need  for  effective  change  had  to  be  paramount. "

1,"Vera  Drake's  Bafta  triumph  hope  |||    At  the  Bafta  film  awards  on  Saturday  night,  there  is  the  prospect  that  a  home-grown  movie  could  walk  off  with  a  clutch  of  trophies.  |||    Vera  Drake,  Mike  Leigh's  tale  about  a  1950s  backstreet  abortionist,  is  nominated  in  11  categories.  These  include  best  film,  best  director  and  best  actress  shortlist  for  Imelda  Staunton  who  plays  the  eponymous  character.  The  film  has  spent  months  being  lauded  with  prizes,  from  the  Venice  Film  Festival  to  five  awards  from  the  London  Critics'  Circle  on  Wednesday  night.  |||    The  Baftas  has  a  tradition  of  honouring  British  cinema,  and  this  year  Vera  Drake  is  the  obvious  candidate  to  be  heaped  with  praise.  Empire  magazine's  reviews  editor  Dan  Jolin  said  the  film  had  ""a  very  good  chance""  of  doing  well  on  Saturday,  predicting  that  it  would  collect  five  or  six  awards.  ""I  don't  think  it's  going  to  do  a  Lord  of  the  Rings-style  sweep,  but  Imelda  Staunton  is  a  shoo-in  for  best  actress,""  he  said.  |||    ""A  best  director  prize  for  Mike  Leigh  and  best  British  film  are  also  likely  and  it  could  steal  some  awards  from  heavily-nominated  competitors  The  Aviator  and  Finding  Neverland.""  Mr  Jolin  tipped  another  contender  -  most  likely  The  Aviator  -  to  walk  away  with  the  Bafta  for  best  film,  and  added  that  Finding  Neverland  had  been  lavished  with  nominations  but  not  trophies.  Strong  Oscar  contenders  Million  Dollar  Baby  and  Sideways  did  not  figure  in  the  Bafta  nominations,  giving  Vera  Drake  greater  potential  to  walk  away  with  the  big  prizes.  |||    ""There  is  a  sense  that  this  film  is  ours  and  we  should  slap  our  own  guys  on  the  back.  Out  of  all  the  films  in  the  running  for  the  Baftas,  Vera  Drake  is  the  true  blue  British  one.""  |||    ""If  Mike  Leigh  is  going  to  win  awards  for  anything,  it  should  be  Vera  Drake  at  this  year's  Baftas"",  said  Mr  Jolin,  adding  that  the  film  was  probably  his  most  technically  accomplished  and  lavish  work  yet.  Mr  Jolin  also  tipped  Phil  Davis  for  a  best  supporting  actor  prize  for  his  role  in  Vera  Drake  but  felt  that  Heather  Craney  could  be  outdone  by  Kate  Winslet  or  Natalie  Portman  in  the  supporting  actress  category.  ""If  there  is  anywhere  where  this  film  is  going  to  win,  it  will  be  at  the  Baftas,""  he  said.  |||    The  Guardian's  film  critic  Peter  Bradshaw  felt  that  there  ""might  well  be""  a  sweep  of  awards  for  Vera  Drake  on  Saturday  night.  ""I  hope  that  Bafta  voters  will  respond  to  the  extremely  high  standard  of  acting  from  the  whole  cast  of  the  film.  If  Bafta  can't  do  so,  what  hope  is  there?""  he  said.  Mr  Bradshaw  felt  that  Mike  Leigh's  ""masterpiece""  was  entitled  to  the  best  film  award  -  leaving  Dead  Man's  Shoes,  Harry  Potter  and  the  Prisoner  of  Azkaban,  My  Summer  of  Love  and  Shaun  of  the  Dead  to  slug  it  out  for  the  best  British  film  trophy.  ""I  will  be  cheering  if  Vera  Drake  wins  a  whole  host  of  awards,""  he  added. "

2,"Commons  hunt  protest  charges  |||    Eight  protesters  who  stormed  the  House  of  Commons  chamber  during  a  debate  on  the  Hunting  Bill  have  been  charged  with  disorderly  conduct.  |||    The  men  were  arrested  in  September  after  bursting  into  the  chamber  causing  a  hunting  ban  debate  to  be  halted.  Those  charged  included  Otis  Ferry,  the  22-year-old  son  of  rock  star  Bryan  Ferry  and  Luke  Tomlinson,  27,  a  close  friend  of  princes  William  and  Harry.  They  were  charged  under  Section  5  of  the  Public  Order  Act,  police  said.  |||    Five  of  the  eight  men  held  an  impromptu  news  conference  outside  Charing  Cross  Police  Station  on  Monday  evening,  after  the  charges  were  formerly  put  to  them.  The  men's  solicitor  Matthew  Knight,  said  that  at  no  time  had  it  occurred  to  the  men  that  they  were  committing  a  criminal  offence.  |||    ""There  is  no  offence  of  trespassing  in  the  House  of  Commons  -  it  is  not  a  criminal  offence,""  he  said.  ""If  Parliament  wanted  to  make  entering  the  House  of  Commons  chamber  on  foot  a  criminal  offence  it  should  have  done  so,  but  it  can't  do  so  retrospectively.  ""We  are  not  prosecuted  for  that.  We  are  prosecuted  for  a  Public  Order  Act  offence.  We  are  not  guilty  of  it.""  They  will  appear  at  Bow  Street  Magistrates'  Court  on  21  December,  a  police  spokesman  said.  Otis  Ferry,  a  former  Eton  pupil  and  joint  leader  of  the  South  Shropshire  Hunt,  said:  ""I  have  no  regrets.  ""We  have  done  nothing  wrong  beyond  the  obvious  which  was  to  stand  up  for  our  rights  and  not  act  like  a  sheep  like  the  rest  of  the  country.""  One  of  the  men,  David  Redvers,  34,  from  Hartpury,  Gloucestershire,  said  he  and  the  other  seven  protesters  would  plead  not  guilty  to  the  charges.  |||    The  other  protesters  are  John  Holliday,  37,  a  huntsman  from  Ledbury,  Herefordshire,  Robert  Thame,  34,  who  plays  polo  with  Princes  Charles  in  Team  Highgrove,  auctioneer  Andrew  Elliot,  42,  from  Bromesberrow,  near  Ledbury,  point-to-point  jockey  Richard  Wakeham,  34,  from  York,  and  former  royal  chef  Nick  Wood,  41.  The  15  September  protest  came  on  the  same  day  as  a  huge  pro-hunting  demonstration  in  Parliament  Square.  Four  of  the  men  ran  out  from  behind  the  speaker's  chair  while  another  wrestled  past  a  doorkeeper  from  a  different  entrance.  The  five  tried  to  confront  MPs  before  they  were  bundled  out  of  the  chamber  and  later  led  away  handcuffed  by  police.  Three  others  had  been  intercepted  by  security  staff  as  they  tried  to  join  the  five  in  the  chamber.  |||    Speaker  Michael  Martin  later  said  the  men  had  used  a  forged  letter  to  gain  access  to  the  House  of  Commons  and  had  been  helped  to  get  close  to  the  chamber  by  a  parliamentary  pass  holder.  In  November,  the  use  of  the  Parliament  Act  meant  a  total  ban  on  hunting  with  dogs  in  England  and  Wales.  However,  many  pro-hunt  activists  remained  defiant  after  the  law  was  passed,  saying  they  would  ignore  the  ban  and  continue  to  hunt.  Last  week,  the  Countryside  Alliance  said  more  than  250  hunts  would  meet  legally  the  day  after  the  ban  on  hunting  with  dogs  comes  into  force.  The  alliance  said  the  19  February  meets  would  show  the  new  law  was  ""impossibly  difficult  to  determine""  and  open  to  different  interpretations. "

1,"Ray  DVD  beats  box  office  takings  |||    Oscar-nominated  film  biopic  Ray  has  surpassed  its  US  box  office  takings  with  a  combined  tally  of  $80m  (£43m)  from  DVD  and  video  sales  and  rentals.  |||    Ray's  success  on  DVD  outstripped  its  $74m  (£40m)  US  box  office  total,  earning  more  than  $40m  (£22m)  on  the  first  day  of  the  DVD's  release  alone.  Ray  has  been  nominated  in  six  Oscar  categories  including  best  film  and  best  actor  for  Jamie  Foxx.  The  film  recounts  the  life  of  blues  singer  Ray  Charles,  who  died  in  2004.  In  its  first  week  on  home  entertainment  release  the  film  was  the  number  one  selling  DVD,  with  the  limited  edition  version  coming  in  at  number  11.  Sony  horror  film  The  Grudge,  starring  Michelle  Gellar,  was  the  US'  second  best-selling  DVD,  with  Jennifer  Lopez  and  Richard  Gere's  romantic  comedy  Shall  We  Dance?  at  number  three.  Foxx's  critically  acclaimed  performance  as  Ray  has  already  earned  him  a  Screen  Actors  Guild  Award  for  best  actor,  as  well  as  a  prestigious  Golden  Globe.  Ray  director  Taylor  Hackford,  responsible  for  the  classic  1982  film  An  Officer  and  a  Gentleman,  has  also  received  an  Oscar  nomination  in  the  best  director  category.  The  film's  three  other  Oscar  nominations  are  for  costume,  film  editing  and  sound  mixing. "

1,"Foxx  and  Swank  take  actors  awards  |||    Jamie  Foxx  and  Hilary  Swank  have  won  the  Screen  Actors  Guild  Awards  for  best  male  and  female  film  actors,  boosting  their  Oscars  hopes  this  month.  |||    Foxx's  portrayal  of  late  soul-singer  Ray  Charles  in  Ray  had  already  earned  him  a  prestigious  Golden  Globe  award.  Swank  triumphed  for  playing  a  gutsy  female  boxer  in  Million  Dollar  Baby.  Modest  wine  country  comedy  Sideways  knocked  out  favourites  Million  Dollar  Baby  and  The  Aviator  by  taking  the  top  prize  for  best  cast  performance.  |||    The  Screen  Actors  Guild  (SAG)  represents  US  film  and  TV  actors.  Its  winners  often  go  on  to  win  Oscars.  In  other  nominations,  Cate  Blanchett  triumphed  as  the  best  supporting  actress  for  her  role  as  Katharine  Hepburn  in  The  Aviator.  Veteran  actor  Morgan  Freeman  took  the  best  supporting  actor  award  for  playing  a  prize-fighter  turned  gym  manager  in  Million  Dollar  Baby.  |||    ""Thank  you  for  Ray  Charles  for  just  living  so  complex  and  so  interesting,  and  making  us  all  just  come  together,""  said  Foxx,  accepting  his  award  in  Los  Angeles  on  Saturday.  |||    He  also  praised  the  film  director:  ""Thank  you  for  Taylor  Hackford  for  taking  a  chance  with  an  African-American  film.  Taylor,  you're  my  director  of  the  year.""  Swank,  too,  was  full  of  praise  for  her  director  and  co-star  Clint  Eastwood.  ""I  bow  down  to  you,""  Swank  said  to  the  74-year-old  Eastwood.  ""You  are  a  talent  beyond  compare.  If  I'm  half  the  person  you  are  and  half  the  talent  you  are  when  I'm  74,  I  will  know  that  I've  accomplished  something  great.""  |||    Both  Foxx  and  Swank  are  now  considered  to  be  among  the  favourites  to  get  Oscars  -  the  Hollywood's  ultimate  prize.  However,  Swank  has  to  overcome  a  strong  challenge  from  Annette  Bening,  a  nominee  for  the  theatre  farce  Being  Julia.  Meanwhile,  ballots  for  Oscars  -  the  Hollywood's  top  honours  -  were  mailed  earlier  this  week  to  members  of  the  Academy  of  Motion  Picture  Arts  and  Sciences.  The  voting  is  due  to  end  on  22  February  -  five  days  before  the  ceremony. "

0,"Cannabis  hopes  for  drug  firm  |||    A  prescription  cannabis  drug  made  by  UK  biotech  firm  GW  Pharmaceuticals  is  set  to  be  approved  in  Canada.  |||    The  drug  is  used  to  treat  the  central  nervous  system  and  alleviate  the  symptoms  of  multiple  sclerosis  (MS).  A  few  weeks  ago,  shares  in  GW  Pharma  lost  a  third  of  their  value  after  UK  regulators  said  they  wanted  more  evidence  about  the  drug's  benefits.  But  now  Canadian  authorities  have  said  the  Sativex  drug  will  be  considered  for  approval.  |||    Approximately  50,000  people  in  Canada  have  been  diagnosed  with  MS  and  85,000  people  are  suffering  from  the  condition  in  the  UK.  Many  patients  already  smoke  cannabis  to  relieve  their  symptoms.  |||    Now,  GW  Pharma's  Sativex  mouth  spray  could  be  legally  available  to  MS  sufferers  in  Canada  within  the  next  few  months.  This  will  be  the  first  time  a  cannabis-based  drug  has  been  approved  anywhere  in  the  world,  representing  a  landmark  for  GW  Pharma  and  for  patients  with  MS.  Final  approval  in  Canada  should  now  be  little  more  than  a  formality,  analysts  said,  and  the  company  expects  full  approval  for  Sativex  early  in  2005.  ""We  are  delighted  to  receive  this  qualifying  notice  from  Health  Canada  and  look  forward  to  receiving  regulatory  approval  for  Sativex  in  Canada  in  the  early  part  of  2005,""  said  GW  Pharma  executive  chairman  Dr  Geoffrey  Guy.  |||    The  UK  government  granted  GW  Pharma  a  licence  to  grow  the  cannabis  plant  for  medical  research  purposes.  Satifex  consists  of  a  cannabis  extract  containing  tetrahydrocannabinol  and  cannabidiol,  a  cocktail  that  has  also  proved  effective  in  treating  patients  with  arthritis.  Thousands  of  plants  are  grown  at  a  secret  location  somewhere  in  the  English  countryside.  Despite  hopes  of  regulatory  approval  last  year,  a  series  of  delays  has  put  back  Sativex's  launch  in  the  UK.  The  latest  news  sent  shares  in  GW  Pharma  up  8.5p,  or  8.1%,  to  113.5p. "

McDonald's  golden  arches,  name  and  ""I'm  loving  it""  catchphrase  will  be  used  throughout  the  half-hour  programme.  The  move  comes  amid  growing  concerns  about  obesity  in  Europe  and  the  US.  |||    The  European  Union  has  called  on  the  food  industry  to  reduce  the  number  of  adverts  aimed  at  young  children,  warning  that  legislation  would  be  introduced.  unless  voluntary  steps  were  taken.  In  the  US,  food  group  Kraft  is  among  firms  that  already  have  cut  back  on  promoting  sugar  and  fattening  products  to  the  young.  McDonalds  has  also  been  taking  steps  to  improve  its  junk  food  reputation,  revamping  its  menu  and  providing  clients  with  health-related  products  such  as  pedometers.  As  well  as  burgers  like  the  Big  Mac  and  Quarter  Pounder  with  Cheese,  the  company  now  sells  healthier  options  such  as  salads  and  fresh  fruit.  Chief  executive  Jim  Skinner  attributed  an  8.3%  increase  in  January  worldwide  sales  to  the  ""vitality  of  our  menu"",  among  other  things.  |||    Hooking  up  with  MTV  is  expected  to  add  extra  momentum  to  McDonald's  recent  revival.  MTV,  which  played  a  key  role  in  the  emergence  of  the  music  video,  is  to  show  Advance  Warning  on  all  25  of  its  channels  across  the  world.  The  programme  can  at  present  only  been  seen  in  the  US,  where  it  has  featured  artists  like  British  stars  Joss  Stone  and  Franz  Ferdinand.  McDonald's  has  targeted  the  youth  market  in  the  past  with  its  advertisements,  signing  up  stars  like  jelly-legged  dancer  Justin  Timberlake  and  all-woman  singing  group  Destiny's  Child.

1,"Ten-year  tragedy  of  missing  Manic  |||    Richey  Edwards,  guitarist  and  lyricist  for  The  Manic  Street  Preachers,  vanished  10  years  ago,  on  1  February  1995.  His  disappearance  remains  one  of  the  most  tragic  mysteries  in  rock  music.  |||    For  his  devoted  fans,  Richey  Edwards  was  an  inspired  and  inspiring  poet,  a  man  who  articulated  their  desperation  and  despair,  who  shouted  the  things  most  kept  hidden.  The  Manic  Street  Preachers  may  only  have  become  stadium-conquering  rock  giants  since  his  disappearance  -  but  Edwards  was  the  figurehead  for  their  first,  dangerous  and  dazzling  incarnation.  Edwards  did  not  feature  in  the  original  line-up  of  the  band,  though.  Singer/guitarist  James  Dean  Bradfield,  bassist  Nicky  Wire  and  drummer  Sean  Moore  were  originally  accompanied  by  a  rhythm  guitarist  called  Flicker.  But  Edwards  replaced  Flicker  in  time  for  the  band's  self-financed  debut,  Suicide  Alley,  after  designing  the  record's  artwork.  |||    After  becoming  a  full-time  member,  Edwards  became  a  critical  part  of  the  band,  writing  lyrics  and  playing  guitar  -  though  in  many  concerts,  he  was  not  actually  plugged  in.  But  the  fiercely  intelligent  Edwards  -  who  name-checked  writers  such  as  Sylvia  Plath,  George  Orwell  and  Philip  Larkin  -  battled  depression,  alcohol  problems,  eating  disorders,  and  self-harm.  By  the  time  the  band  released  their  third  album,  The  Holy  Bible,  in  October  1994,  Edwards  had  been  admitted  to  hospital  with  depression.  But  in  his  last  interview  a  few  months  later,  seemed  to  be  making  plans  for  the  future.  |||    Edwards  walks  out  of  the  Embassy  Hotel  in  London  in  the  early  morning,  ahead  of  the  band's  US  tour  to  promote  The  Holy  Bible.  In  the  following  days,  police  issue  a  missing  person  alert  and  his  parents,  Graham  and  Sherry,  plead  for  their  son  to  let  them  know  he  is  safe  and  well.  |||    Police  discover  Edwards'  car  in  a  car  park  near  the  Severn  Bridge  near  Bristol  -  a  notorious  suicide  spot.  The  discovery  leads  many  to  believe  he  has  killed  himself.  The  rest  of  the  band  stop  touring  and  recording.  |||    The  band  play  their  first  concerts  since  Edwards'  disappearance  as  a  trio,  performing  support  slots  for  The  Stone  Roses  on  their  UK  stadium  tour.  |||    The  Manic  Street  Preachers  release  their  first  music  since  Edwards'  disappearance.  A  Design  For  Life  reaches  number  two  in  the  UK  singles  chart.  The  album  Everything  Must  Go  follows.  |||    The  Manics  win  best  band  and  best  album  for  Everything  Must  Go  at  the  Brit  Awards.  |||    A  fan  says  she  saw  Edwards  in  the  hippy  resort  of  Goa,  India.  Interpol  are  alerted  but  do  not  track  him  down.  |||    Graham  and  Sherry  Edwards  fly  to  the  Spanish  island  of  Fuerteventura  six  weeks  after  reports  a  man  fitting  their  son's  description  has  been  seen  in  a  bar  called  Underground.  The  report  comes  to  nothing.  |||    Edwards'  sister  Rachel  makes  an  emotional  TV  appeal  five  years  after  the  disappearance.  ""I'd  just  like  to  say  to  him  if  he  is  able  to  listen  that  we  do  love  him  very  much  and  we'd  like  him  to  come  back  -  me,  mum  and  dad,""  she  said.  |||    The  band  play  a  concert  in  the  Cuban  capital,  Havana  -  the  first  contemporary  western  rock  band  to  play  there.  |||    On  the  seventh  anniversary  of  his  disappearance,  police  offer  Edwards'  parents  the  opportunity  to  sign  a  death  certificate.  They  refuse.  The  Big  Issue  magazine,  which  supports  homelessness  charities,  prints  the  last  known  picture  of  Edwards  in  a  fresh  plea  for  information.  |||    A  pair  of  trainers  containing  human  bones  washed  up  on  the  banks  of  the  River  Severn  have  no  link  to  Edwards,  police  say.  |||    The  last  song  written  by  Edwards  -  a  song  called  Judge  Y'Self,  which  was  to  have  been  used  for  the  Judge  Dredd  film  soundtrack  -  is  released  on  the  B-side  compilation  Lipstick  Traces.  A  skeleton  found  by  the  River  Severn  is  not  Edwards,  tests  reveal.  |||    The  Manics'  seventh  studio  album,  Lifeblood,  features  a  song  dedicated  to  Edwards  called  Cardiff  Afterlife.  |||    The  remaining  Manic  Street  Preachers  members  continue  to  pay  a  quarter  of  the  band's  royalties  into  an  account  held  in  his  name.

1,"Ocean's  Twelve  raids  box  office  |||    Ocean's  Twelve,  the  crime  caper  sequel  starring  George  Clooney,  Brad  Pitt  and  Julia  Roberts,  has  gone  straight  to  number  one  in  the  US  box  office  chart.  |||    It  took  $40.8m  (£21m)  in  weekend  ticket  sales,  according  to  studio  estimates.  The  sequel  follows  the  master  criminals  as  they  try  to  pull  off  three  major  heists  across  Europe.  It  knocked  last  week's  number  one,  National  Treasure,  into  third  place.  Wesley  Snipes'  Blade:  Trinity  was  in  second,  taking  $16.1m  (£8.4m).  Rounding  out  the  top  five  was  animated  fable  The  Polar  Express,  starring  Tom  Hanks,  and  festive  comedy  Christmas  with  the  Kranks.  |||    Ocean's  Twelve  box  office  triumph  marks  the  fourth-biggest  opening  for  a  December  release  in  the  US,  after  the  three  films  in  the  Lord  of  the  Rings  trilogy.  The  sequel  narrowly  beat  its  2001  predecessor,  Ocean's  Eleven  which  took  $38.1m  (£19.8m)  on  its  opening  weekend  and  $184m  (£95.8m)  in  total.  A  remake  of  the  1960s  film,  starring  Frank  Sinatra  and  the  Rat  Pack,  Ocean's  Eleven  was  directed  by  Oscar-winning  director  Steven  Soderbergh.  Soderbergh  returns  to  direct  the  hit  sequel  which  reunites  Clooney,  Pitt  and  Roberts  with  Matt  Damon,  Andy  Garcia  and  Elliott  Gould.  Catherine  Zeta-Jones  joins  the  all-star  cast.  ""It's  just  a  fun,  good  holiday  movie,""  said  Dan  Fellman,  president  of  distribution  at  Warner  Bros.  However,  US  critics  were  less  complimentary  about  the  $110m  (£57.2m)  project,  with  the  Los  Angeles  Times  labelling  it  a  ""dispiriting  vanity  project"".  A  milder  review  in  the  New  York  Times  dubbed  the  sequel  ""unabashedly  trivial"". "

2,"Goldsmith  denies  war  advice  claim  |||    The  attorney  general  has  denied  his  statement  to  Parliament  about  the  legality  of  the  Iraq  war  was  drafted  by  Downing  Street  officials.  |||    Lord  Goldsmith  said  Lord  Falconer  and  Baroness  Morgan  played  no  part  in  drafting  the  answer.  He  added  the  answer  represented  his  view  that  the  war  was  legal,  but  was  not  a  summary  of  his  advice  to  the  PM.  The  government  has  resisted  calls  to  publish  the  full  advice,  saying  such  papers  are  always  kept  confidential.  |||    In  a  statement,  Lord  Goldsmith  said:  ""I  was  fully  involved  throughout  the  drafting  process  and  personally  finalised,  and  of  course  approved,  the  answer.""  He  said  the  answer  had  been  prepared  in  his  office  with  the  involvement  of  Solicitor  General  Harriet  Harman,  two  of  his  own  officials,  three  Foreign  Office  officials,  a  QC,  Christopher  Greenwood  and  the  then  Lord  Chancellor,  Lord  Irvine  of  Lairg.  |||    ""No  other  minister  or  official  was  involved  in  any  way.""  He  suggested  the  claim  that  Lord  Falconer  and  Lady  Morgan  had  drafted  the  answer  were  the  result  of  a  mis-transcription  of  his  evidence  to  the  Butler  Inquiry  into  pre-war  intelligence.  ""As  I  have  always  made  clear,  I  set  out  in  the  answer  my  own  genuinely  held,  independent  view  that  military  action  was  lawful  under  the  existing  (UN)  Security  Council  resolutions,""  he  said.  ""The  answer  did  not  purport  to  be  a  summary  of  my  confidential  legal  advice  to  government.""  Former  foreign  secretary  Robin  Cook  said  Lord  Goldsmith's  admission  that  his  parliamentary  answer  was  not  a  summary  of  his  legal  opinion  suggested  Parliament  may  have  been  misled.  ""The  attorney  general  may  never  have  presented  his  answer  as  a  summary,  but  others  certainly  did,""  he  said.  ""What  is  clear  from  his  statement  today  is  that  he  does  not  believe  that  it  was  a  full,  accurate  summary  of  his  formal  opinion.""  |||    Earlier,  Tony  Blair  dismissed  questions  about  the  attorney  general's  advice,  and  said  his  Parliamentary  statement  had  been  a  ""fair  summary""  of  his  opinion.  ""That's  what  he  (Lord  Goldsmith)  said  and  that's  what  I  say.  He  has  dealt  with  this  time  and  time  and  time  again,""  Mr  Blair  told  his  monthly  news  conference  in  Downing  Street.  He  refused  to  answer  further  questions  on  the  issue.  |||    On  the  question  of  whether  such  papers  have  always  been  kept  confidential,  Tory  MP  Michael  Mates,  who  is  a  member  of  the  Commons  intelligence  and  security  committee  and  was  part  of  the  Butler  inquiry,  told  the  BBC:  ""That,  as  a  general  rule,  is  right,  but  it's  not  an  absolute  rule.""  He  said  there  had  been  other  occasions  when  advice  had  been  published,  most  recently  regarding  Prince  Charles's  marriage  plans.  The  government  could  not  pick  and  choose  when  to  use  the  convention,  he  said.  Mr  Mates  added:  ""This  may  be  one  of  those  special  occasions...  when  it  would  be  in  the  public  interest  to  see  the  advice  which  the  attorney  general  gave  to  the  prime  minister.""  |||    The  claims  about  Lord  Falconer  and  Baroness  Morgan's  involvement  were  made  in  a  book  published  this  week  by  Philippe  Sands  QC,  a  member  of  Cherie  Blair's  Matrix  Chambers.  He  also  says  Lord  Goldsmith  warned  Tony  Blair  on  7  March  2003  that  the  Iraq  war  could  be  illegal  without  a  second  UN  resolution  sanctioning  military  action.  |||    A  short  statement  about  Lord  Goldsmith's  position  presented  in  a  written  parliamentary  answer  on  17  March  2003  -  just  before  a  crucial  Commons  vote  on  the  military  action  -  did  not  suggest  this.  Former  minister  Clare  Short,  who  resigned  from  the  government  over  the  Iraq  war,  said  the  ministerial  answer  was  the  same  statement  that  was  earlier  shown  to  the  cabinet  as  it  discussed  military  action.  She  said  the  full  advice  should  have  been  attached,  according  to  the  ministerial  code,  and  demanded  a  Lords  inquiry  into  the  matter.  The  Conservatives  and  Liberal  Democrats  say  they  still  want  the  publication  of  the  full  legal  advice  given  by  the  Attorney  General.  Lib  Dem  foreign  affairs  spokesman  Sir  Menzies  Campbell  said  Lord  Goldsmith's  statement  still  did  not  clear  up  the  outstanding  issues.  ""If  his  original  advice  of  7  March  accepted  that  military  action  might  be  illegal,  how  was  it  that  he  resolved  any  such  doubts  by  the  time  the  Parliamentary  answer  was  published  on  17  March?""  he  said.  ""Only  the  fullest  disclosure  will  now  do."" "

0,"Senior  Fannie  Mae  bosses  resign  |||    The  two  most  senior  executives  at  US  mortgage  giant  Fannie  Mae  have  resigned  after  accounting  irregularities  were  uncovered  at  the  company.  |||    Chief  executive  Franklin  Raines,  a  former  senior  official  in  the  Clinton  administration,  and  chief  financial  officer  Tim  Howard  have  left  the  firm.  Fannie  Mae  was  criticised  by  financial  regulators  and  could  have  to  restate  its  earnings  by  up  to  $9bn  (£4.6bn).  It  is  America's  second  largest  financial  institution.  |||    Recent  investigations  have  exposed  extensive  accounting  errors  at  Fannie  Mae,  which  supplies  funds  to  America's  $8  trillion  mortgage  market.  Last  week,  the  firm  was  admonished  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  which  said  it  had  made  major  errors  in  its  financial  reporting.  |||    The  financial  regulator  said  Fannie  Mae  would  have  to  raise  substantial  new  capital  to  restore  its  balance  sheet.  Analysts  said  the  SEC's  criticism  made  it  impossible  for  Fannie  Mae's  senior  executives  to  remain.  Mr  Raines,  head  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  under  President  Clinton,  has  taken  early  retirement  while  Mr  Howard  has  also  stepped  down,  the  company  said  on  Tuesday.  KPMG,  Fannie  Mae's  independent  auditor,  will  also  be  replaced.  ""By  my  early  retirement,  I  have  held  myself  accountable,""  Mr  Raines  said  in  a  statement.  |||    Fannie  Mae  was  found  to  have  violated  accounting  rules  relating  to  derivatives  -  financial  instruments  used  to  hedge  against  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  -  and  some  pre-paid  loans.  As  a  result,  it  could  be  forced  to  restate  $9bn  in  earnings  over  the  past  four  years,  effectively  wiping  out  a  third  of  the  company's  profits  since  2001.  Although  not  making  loans  directly  to  buyers,  Fannie  Mae  is  the  largest  single  player  in  the  mortgage  market,  underwriting  half  of  all  US  house  purchases.  The  firm  operates  under  charter  from  the  US  Congress.  It  has  faced  stinging  criticism  from  Congressional  leaders  who  held  hearings  into  its  finances  earlier  this  year  and  from  government  regulator,  the  Office  of  Federal  Housing  Enterprise  Oversight  (OFHEO).  ""We  are  encouraged  that  the  board's  announcement  signals  a  new  culture  and  a  new  direction  for  Fannie  Mae,""  Armando  Falcon,  OFHEO  director  said.  The  problems  afflicting  Fannie  Mae  are  just  the  latest  to  hit  the  US  mortgage  industry.  Freddie  Mac,  the  country's  other  largest  mortgage  firm,  was  forced  to  restate  its  earnings  by  $4.4bn  last  year  and  pay  a  $125m  fine  after  an  investigation  of  its  books. "

2,"Will  the  Budget  bring  out  smiling  voters?  |||    As  Tory  spokesman  Oliver  Letwin  said  -  any  chancellor  would  use  his  pre-election  budget  to  offer  some  vote  winning  sweeteners,  wouldn't  he.  |||    And  everyone  does,  indeed,  expect  Gordon  Brown  to  do  just  that  in  his  last  budget  before  the  expected  polling  day  of  5  May.  There  will  be  plenty  of  talk  about  taking  no  risks  with  the  economy  or  handing  out  irresponsible  giveaways.  But  Mr  Brown  will  stun  Westminster  and  break  just  about  every  historical  precedent  if  he  fails  to  do  something  designed  to  put  a  smile  on  voters'  faces  and  make  them  more  inclined  to  back  Labour  in  the  election.  And  there  has  already  been  speculation  about  possible  tax  reductions  for  the  poorest  and  increasing  the  threshold  on  stamp  duty  in  this  week's  Budget.  The  aim  of  his  package  will  be  to  keep  any  disillusioned  core  Labour  voters  in  the  fold,  while  ensuring  the  middle  England  voters  who  gave  Tony  Blair  two  election  victories  don't  desert  him  at  the  third  poll.  |||    And,  needless  to  say,  there  will  be  plenty  of  analysis  of  what  impact  the  Budget  will  have  on  Mr  Brown's  own  ambitions  to  replace  Mr  Blair  as  prime  minister  at  some  point  after  a  third  win.  But  there  is  a  shadow  hanging  over  this  pre-election  performance  -  in  the  shape  of  £11  billion  or  thereabouts.  That  is  the  size  of  the  financial  ""black  hole""  the  Tories,  backed  by  some  independent  forecasters,  believe  Mr  Brown  will  have  to  fill  with  tax  increases  after  the  election.  |||    The  opening  shot  in  that  battle  was  fired  at  the  weekend  with  claims  a  Treasury  leak  suggested  Mr  Brown  was  ready  to  slap  capital  gains  tax  on  home  sales  to  raise  some  of  that  cash.  It  was  immediately  denied,  but  the  Tories  remain  suspicious,  claiming  that,  as  Mr  Letwin  said,  if  the  money  does  not  come  from  there,  where  will  it  come  from.  |||    Mr  Brown  will  undoubtedly  claim  the  forecasts  are  simply  wrong  and  that  he  will  have  absolutely  no  need  to  raise  taxes  after  the  election,  should  Labour  win.  Previous  gloomy  forecasts  proved  wrong,  he  will  argue,  while  suggesting  that  only  by  sticking  with  him  can  Britain  continue  to  have  a  sound  economy,  low  unemployment  and  high  public  spending.  The  opposition  will  reject  that  by  claiming  they  can  keep  the  economy  sound,  increase  spending  and  cut  taxes  at  the  same  time.  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats  will  also  promise  to  run  a  sound  economy,  but  based  on  increased  taxes  to  fund  spending  and,  amongst  other  things,  abolishing  the  council  tax  in  favour  of  a  local  income  tax.  And  there  will  be  prolonged  argument  over  which  of  the  parties  can  make  the  greatest  savings  in  Whitehall  and  beyond  to  fund  their  policies.  But  probably  what  that  all  boils  down  to  is  a  simple  question  of  which  of  the  parties  the  voters  most  trust  to  keep  the  economy  stable  and  avoid  any  unpleasant  surprises  in  the  coming  years.  And  it  is  probably  still  the  answer  to  that  one  question  that  will  overwhelmingly  decide  the  outcome  of  the  general  election. "

1,"Dance  music  not  dead  says  Fatboy  |||    DJ  Norman  Cook  -  aka  Fatboy  Slim  -  has  said  that  dance  music  is  not  dead,  but  has  admitted  it  is  currently  going  through  a  ""fallow  patch"".  |||    The  commercial  failure  of  the  latest  albums  by  Britain's  two  biggest  dance  acts  -  Fatboy  Slim's  Palookaville  and  The  Prodigy's  Always  Outnumbered  Never  Outgunned  -  has  been  coupled  with  the  closure  of  many  ""superclubs,""  and  the  folding  of  three  dance  music  magazines.  Last  month  the  Brit  Awards  announced  they  would  no  longer  be  awarding  a  Best  Dance  Act  prize,  with  the  Brits  committee  announcing  that  ""dance  music  is  no  longer  where  it's  happening  in  music.""  These  developments  lead  some  to  suggest  that  dance  was  finished  as  a  popular  music  genre.  Cook  acknowledged  that  much  change  in  the  dance  world  in  the  four  years  since  his  last  album,  Halfway  Between  The  Gutter  And  The  Stars,  but  he  stressed  this  did  not  mean  the  dance  scene  was  permanently  over.  ""Every  week  when  I  was  making  the  album,  I  was  reading  articles  about  the  demise  of  dance  music  -  and  obviously  that  affects  you  somewhat,""  he  told  BBC  World  Service's  The  Ticket  programme.  ""I  personally  don't  believe  it's  either  dead  or  going  to  die,  but  it's  going  through  a  bit  of  a  fallow  patch.  ""So  I  think,  consciously  or  subconsciously,  reading  every  week  that  dance  music  was  dead  I  would  think  'right,  scrub  that  track  then'.""  |||    Although  his  album  sales  in  the  UK  are  down  -  Palookaville  stayed  in  the  UK  top  75  for  just  three  weeks  -  Cook  has  achieved  recent  global  success  with  his  beach  parties.  And  event  on  Brighton  sea  front  in  2002  attracted  250,000,  people,  while  a  later  one  in  Rio  achieved  a  crowd  of  360,000.  The  DVD  of  the  Rio  set  was  the  biggest  seller  of  that  year.  |||    ""With  a  crowd  that  big,  if  the  weather's  nice,  the  atmosphere  before  I  even  go  is  so  good  that  about  halfway  through  the  first  record  I  think  'I've  got  them',""  Cook  said.  ""I'm  always  really  really  nervous  before  the  big  ones  -  they  had  to  give  me  Valium  before  Rio,  because  two  hours  before  I  was  literally  just  pacing  the  floor.  ""For  some  reason,  especially  now  I've  got  a  reputation  for  it,  the  atmosphere  and  the  joie  de  vivre  that's  already  going  on  means  all  I  have  to  do  is  play  'up'  records.""  He  promised  more  such  parties  in  more  locations  around  the  world  -  despite  problems  after  the  Brighton  event,  which  ended  in  chaos  with  many  revellers  finding  themselves  stranded  as  transport  ground  to  a  halt.  One  man  also  died  of  a  heart  attack,  and  a  woman  fell  to  her  death  during  the  free  party.  ""We're  having  to  widen  our  horizons  from  just  beaches,  because  there's  landlocked  countries  that  want  to  get  involved,""  Cook  said.  ""We're  doing  Rio  at  the  carnival,  at  the  Maracana,  and  Sao  Paolo  -  our  new  gig  is  famous  football  stadiums.""  |||    The  DJ  admitted,  however,  that  his  massive  worldwide  success  had  a  downside,  with  intense  media  interest  in  his  personal  life.  In  particular,  he  said  he  had  struggled  to  cope  with  tabloid  intrusion  during  the  temporary  break-up  of  his  marriage  to  Radio  One  presenter  Zoe  Ball,  after  she  was  linked  with  DJ  Dan  Peppe.  |||    ""The  tabloid  thing  has  been  difficult  at  times,""  Cook  said.  ""Especially  the  me-and-Zoe-Gate  -  it's  quite  scary.""  He  said  that  he  had  been  ""determined""  that  what  had  happened  with  Ball  did  not  affect  the  album.  ""At  first  I  was  doing  deliberately  jolly  tunes  so  that  people  wouldn't  think  I  was  depressed,""  he  explained.  ""Then  I  thought,  'that's  not  right'.""  And  he  highlighted  a  bizarre  coincidence  -  that  one  song  written  before  they  split  had  turned  out  to  have  a  great  deal  more  meaning  than  intended.  ""I  said  to  Zoe,  'I  did  this  track  called  My  Masochistic  Baby  Went  And  Left  Me,  do  you  mind  if  it's  on  the  album?'""  he  recalled.  ""She  said,  'yeah,  it's  hilarious,  because  your  masochistic  baby  did  leave  you'.""  Cook  also  added  that  he  had  some  ways  of  coping  with  the  intense  paparazzi  pressure,  which  accumulates  at  the  end  of  the  private  road  he  lives  on  -  where  Paul  McCartney  is  a  neighbour.  ""It's  almost  like  prisoners  rattling  the  bars  with  their  mugs,""  Cook  explained.  ""If  there's  a  pap  at  the  end  of  the  road,  everyone  knocks  on  each  other's  doors  -  Paul  comes  round,  and  we  warn  him,  because  we  don't  know  who  they're  after."" "

2,"UKIP  outspent  Labour  on  EU  poll  |||    The  UK  Independence  Party  outspent  both  Labour  and  the  Liberal  Democrats  in  the  European  elections,  new  figures  show.  |||    UKIP,  which  campaigned  on  a  slogan  of  ""Say  no  to  Europe"",  spent  £2.36m  on  the  campaign  -  second  only  to  the  Conservatives'  £3.13m.  The  campaign  took  UKIP  into  third  place  with  an  extra  10  MEPs.  Labour's  campaign  cost  £1.7m,  the  Lib  Dems'  £1.19m  and  the  Greens'  £404,000,  according  to  figures  revealed  by  the  Electoral  Commission  on  Wednesday.  Much  of  the  UKIP  funding  came  from  Yorkshire  millionaire  Sir  Paul  Sykes,  who  helped  bankroll  the  party's  billboard  campaign.  Critics  have  accused  the  party  of  effectively  buying  votes.  But  a  UKIP  spokesman  said  Labour  and  the  Conservatives  had  spent  £10m  between  them  on  the  last  general  election.  ""With  the  advantages  of  public  money  the  others  have,  the  only  way  the  smaller  parties  can  get  their  message  across  is  by  buying  the  advertising  space,""  he  added. "

2,"Profile:  Gordon  Brown  |||    The  ultimate  prize  of  10  Downing  Street  may  continue  to  elude  him  but,  as  he  prepares  to  deliver  a  record-breaking  ninth  budget,  Gordon  Brown  can  at  least  console  himself  with  the  thought  that  he  is  the  longest  serving  chancellor  of  modern  times.  |||    He  reached  that  milestone  last  June,  when  he  overtook  David  Lloyd  George,  who  served  for  seven  years  and  43  days  between  1908  and  1915.  How  much  longer  Mr  Brown  will  continue  in  the  job  is  not  clear  (he  once  said  there  are  two  types  of  chancellor:  ""those  who  fail  and  those  who  get  out  in  time."")  There  are  rumours  he  will  be  moved  to  the  Foreign  Office  if  Labour  wins  the  general  election.  But,  for  now,  Mr  Brown  dominates  the  domestic  political  scene  like  few  chancellors  -  or  politicians  -  before  him.  |||    Gordon  Brown  was  born  in  Glasgow  on  20  February  1951,  the  son  of  a  Church  of  Scotland  Minister  in  the  small  Fife  town  of  Kirkcaldy.  At  12,  he  was  canvassing  for  Labour  and  by  his  20s  he  was  a  leading  political  activist  in  Scotland.  He  achieved  a  first  class  degree  in  history  from  Edinburgh  University,  where  he  went  on  to  complete  a  PhD.  His  early  career  was  spent  lecturing,  working  in  television  and  making  a  name  for  himself  in  the  Scottish  Labour  Party.  |||    His  first  attempt  to  enter  Westminster,  for  Edinburgh  South  in  1979,  was  thwarted  by  the  present  Tory  spokesman  on  foreign  affairs,  Michael  Ancram.  But  in  1983,  he  took  Dunfermline  East,  a  new  constituency  including  Rosyth  naval  base,  pit  villages  and  coastal  towns.  |||    Entering  Westminster,  he  came  to  share  an  office  with  the  newly  elected  MP  for  Sedgefield,  Tony  Blair.  Within  four  years,  Mr  Brown  had  gained  his  first  frontbench  post  as  shadow  chief  secretary  to  the  Treasury.  He  became  shadow  chancellor  under  John  Smith's  leadership  in  1992.  After  the  death  of  leader  John  Smith  in  1994  he  stood  aside,  agreeing  to  give  Tony  Blair  a  clear  run  at  the  leadership  during  a  now  infamous  meal  at  the  Granita  restaurant  in  Islington.  |||    The  other  part  of  the  deal,  that  Mr  Blair  will  one  day  stand  down  in  favour  of  the  chancellor,  is  the  stuff  of  Westminster  legend.  Mr  Blair's  supporters  say  such  a  deal  never  existed  and  endless  newspaper  columns  -  and  even  a  television  film  -  have  been  devoted  to  the  alleged  deal.  But  if  his  leadership  ambitions  were  at  least  temporarily  thwarted  in  1994,  Mr  Brown  continued  his  devotion  to  politics.  During  the  1997  election  campaign,  he  is  said  to  have  worked  an  average  of  18  hours  a  day,  six  days  a  week  after  running  on  a  treadmill  for  an  hour  each  morning.  |||    This  dedication  to  his  career  was  underlined  by  a  comment  by  Mr  Brown's  former  girlfriend  of  five  years,  Princess  Marguerite  of  Romania,  the  eldest  daughter  of  ex-King  Michael  of  Romania,  who  said  a  relationship  with  him  was  ""politics,  politics,  politics"".  |||    If  that  was  true  then,  Mr  Brown,  who  married  PR  executive  Sarah  Macaulay  in  2000,  changed  his  perspective  when  the  couple  were  hit  by  tragedy  early  in  2002.  Their  daughter  Jennifer  died  in  Edinburgh  Royal  Infirmary,  10  days  after  being  born  seven  weeks  prematurely.  A  year  later,  in  October  2003,  the  couple  had  a  son  -  John  -  an  event  which  again  gave  the  chancellor  an  opportunity  to  show  his  softer  side.  A  trip  to  Africa  earlier  this  year,  to  publicise  his  scheme  to  cancel  the  debt  of  poor  nations,  also  gave  the  chancellor  an  opportunity  to  show  his  more  human  side.  |||    The  ideological  differences  between  Mr  Brown  and  Mr  Blair  remain  relatively  modest.  The  chancellor  opposes  the  further  encroachment  of  the  market  into  the  NHS  and  is  seen  as  being  more  ""Old  Labour""  than  Mr  Blair  in  his  approach  to  wealth  redistribution.  But  their  shared  belief  that  market  economics  are  compatible  with  social  justice  continues  to  form  the  ideological  heart  of  the  New  Labour  project.  Yet  they  are  portrayed  by  the  media  as  being  locked  in  almost  permanent  conflict,  with  Mr  Brown  supposedly  nursing  resentment  at  being  betrayed  by  his  younger  Downing  Street  neighbour  over  the  succession.  Mr  Blair,  for  his  part,  is  said  to  be  frustrated  that  his  public  service  reforms  are  being  thwarted  by  a  vengeful  Mr  Brown,  who  reportedly  delights  in  keeping  the  prime  minister  in  the  dark  over  the  contents  of  his  Budget  until  the  last  possible  minute.  After  a  recent  run  of  negative  headlines,  Labour  MPs  took  the  unprecedented  step  of  making  a  direct  appeal  to  the  two  men  stop  bickering,  for  the  good  of  the  party.  Events  like  this,  and  the  testimony  of  former  ministerial  colleagues,  make  it  impossible  to  dismiss  the  Brown/Blair  feud  as  just  journalistic  hearsay,  cooked  up  by  hacks  and  camp  followers  in  the  hothouse  atmosphere  of  Westminster.  How  much  it  damages  the  ability  of  government  to  do  its  job  is  open  to  question.  |||    A  truce  appears  to  have  been  called  in  the  run  up  to  the  general  election  after  a  fresh  spat  was  sparked  by  Blairite  Alan  Milburn  being  brought  in  over  the  head  of  Mr  Brown  to  run  the  election  campaign.  But  with  the  Tories  having  appeared  to  get  the  better  of  the  pre-election  campaign  thus  far  there  are  reports  that  Mr  Brown  -  using  the  Budget  as  a  springboard  -  is  to  revitalise  Labour's  campaign.  Amid  all  this  it  is  easy  to  forget  that  Mr  Brown  remains  the  man  most  likely  to  succeed  Mr  Blair  as  Labour  leader.  There  may  be  no  shortage  of  possible  contenders  for  the  crown  -  including  Mr  Milburn  -  but  none  can  command  the  sort  of  support  in  the  parliamentary  party  and  beyond  that  Mr  Brown  can.  And  Mr  Blair's  decision  to  name  his  own  retirement  date  has  at  least  given  Mr  Brown  something  to  aim  for  -  even  if  the  prime  minister's  intention  to  ""serve  a  full  third  term""  if  elected,  took  the  shine  off  the  announcement  for  the  chancellor  and  his  supporters.

0,"Glazer  makes  new  Man  Utd  approach  |||    Malcolm  Glazer  has  made  a  fresh  approach  to  buy  Manchester  United,  which  could  lead  to  a  bid  valuing  the  Premiership  club  at  £800m.  |||    The  US  tycoon,  who  has  been  wooing  the  club  for  the  last  12  months,  has  approached  the  United  board  with  ""detailed  proposals"",  it  has  confirmed.  Mr  Glazer,  who  owns  the  Tampa  Bay  Buccaneers  team,  hopes  this  will  lead  to  a  formal  bid  being  accepted.  His  new  offer  is  expected  to  contain  substantially  less  debt.  Mr  Glazer  has  already  had  one  takeover  attempt  turned  down  by  the  Red  Devils  and  responded  by  using  his  28.1%  shareholding  to  vote  off  three  board  members  last  November.  |||    Man  United  had  turned  down  the  bid  because  it  was  based  on  a  high  level  of  borrowing.  But  newspapers  have  speculated  recently  that  the  tycoon  had  gained  the  support  of  leading  banks  to  come  up  with  a  stronger  and  less  debt-laden  bid.  Last  week,  however,  Mr  Glazer  issued  a  statement  to  the  Stock  Exchange  distancing  himself  from  a  new  bid.  |||    Meanwhile,  United's  chief  executive  David  Gill  said  in  December  that  talks  would  not  resume  unless  Glazer  came  up  with  ""definitive  proposals"".  Now  the  board  has  confirmed  that  the  US  bidder  is  back,  with  a  statement  issued  on  Sunday  reading:  ""The  board  can  confirm  it  has  now  received  a  detailed  proposal  subject  to  various  preconditions  which  may  form  the  basis  of  an  offer.  ""A  further  announcement  will  be  made  in  due  course.""  |||    To  succeed  Malcolm  Glazer  will  still  need  the  approval  of  major  shareholders  John  Magnier  and  JP  McManus,  who  own  28.9%  of  the  club.  But  the  Irish  duo  have  cut  off  talks  with  Glazer  over  the  proposed  sale  of  their  stake  and  have  so  far  made  no  comment  on  his  latest  approach.  United  fans  have  reacted  with  anger  at  the  announcement.  They  have  vehemently  opposed  any  proposed  takeover  by  Glazer  since  he  first  showed  interest  in  the  club  in  September  2003  and  after  Sunday's  announcement  they  vowed  to  fight  on.  ""We  will  fight  tooth  and  nail  to  stop  him  whatever  his  offer  says.

0,"Golden  rule  boost  for  Chancellor  |||    Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  has  been  given  a  £2.1bn  boost  in  his  attempts  to  meet  his  golden  economic  rule,  which  allows  him  to  borrow  only  for  investment.  |||    The  extra  leeway  came  after  the  Office  for  National  Statistics  said  it  had  been  measuring  road  expenditure  data  wrongly  over  the  past  five  years.  It  comes  just  weeks  ahead  of  the  Budget  and  an  expected  general  election.  Shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  said:  ""At  best  the  timing  of  these  changes  is  very  convenient  for  the  government.""  |||    A  review  by  the  ONS  found  it  had  made  a  mistake  by  ""double  counting""  some  spending  on  roads  since  1998/9.  Correcting  the  error  would  mean  reducing  current  expenditure  and  increasing  net  investment,  thus  helping  Mr  Brown  to  meet  his  ""golden  rule""  of  borrowing  only  to  invest  over  the  economic  cycle.  Economists  speculated  that  it  might  also  allow  for  some  vote-catching  measures  in  the  Budget.  |||    The  changes  by  the  ONS  increase  the  current  budget  measure  for  the  past  five  years  by  £2.1bn  in  total.  Mr  Letwin  said:  ""This  is  a  very  murky  area...  There  will  inevitably  be  suspicions  that  the  figures  are  being  fiddled.""  The  Conservatives  also  said  Mr  Brown  would  still  be  forced  to  raise  taxes  after  the  general  election  to  fill  an  annual  £10.5bn  ""black  hole""  in  the  nation's  coffers.  But  the  Treasury  said  there  would  be  no  relaxation  of  economic  discipline  and  the  golden  rule  would  be  met  even  without  the  data  revisions.  |||    In  January  the  independent  Institute  for  Fiscal  Studies  (IFS)  said  Mr  Brown  would  need  to  raise  taxes  to  get  public  finances  onto  the  track  predicted  in  last  year's  Budget.  It  also  said  the  government  might  narrowly  miss  its  ""golden  rule""  if  the  current  economic  cycle  ended  in  2005/06.  After  the  ONS  announcement,  economists  said  there  could  also  be  a  proportionate  boost  to  the  current  budget  in  2004/05  of  about  £400m.  ""None  of  this  changes  the  big  picture  of  a  dramatic  deterioration  in  the  overall  fiscal  position  over  the  last  four  or  five  years,""  said  Jonathan  Loynes,  chief  UK  economist  at  Capital  Economics.  ""Accordingly,  it  seems  very  likely  that  some  form  of  fiscal  consolidation  will  be  required  in  due  course."" "

0,"US  economy  shows  solid  GDP  growth  |||    The  US  economy  has  grown  more  than  expected,  expanding  at  an  annual  rate  of  3.8%  in  the  last  quarter  of  2004.  |||    The  gross  domestic  product  figure  was  ahead  of  the  3.1%  the  government  estimated  a  month  ago.  The  rise  reflects  stronger  spending  by  businesses  on  capital  equipment  and  a  smaller-than-expected  trade  deficit.  GDP  is  a  measure  of  a  country's  economic  health,  reflecting  the  value  of  the  goods  and  services  it  produces.  |||    The  new  GDP  figure,  announced  by  the  Commerce  Department  on  Friday,  also  topped  the  3.5%  growth  rate  that  economists  had  forecast  ahead  of  Friday's  announcement.  Growth  was  at  an  annual  rate  of  4%  in  the  third  quarter  of  2004  and  for  the  year  it  came  in  at  4.4%,  the  best  figure  in  five  years.  However,  the  positive  economic  climate  may  lead  to  a  rise  in  interest  rates,  with  many  expecting  US  rates  to  rise  on  22  March.  In  the  January-to-March  quarter,  the  economy  is  expected  to  grow  at  an  annual  rate  of  about  4%,  economists  forecast.  In  the  final  quarter  of  2004,  businesses  increased  spending  on  capital  equipment  and  software  by  18%,  up  from  17.5%  in  the  third  quarter.  Consumer  spending  grew  4.2%  in  the  final  quarter,  down  from  the  third  quarter's  5.1%. "

2,"Minister  defends  hunting  ban  law  |||    The  law  banning  hunting  with  dogs  in  England  and  Wales  is  enforceable  and  ""very  clear"",  Alun  Michael  has  said.  |||    The  rural  affairs  minister  said  it  would  become  obvious  if  people  flouted  the  law,  which  came  into  force  on  Friday,  and  pretended  they  were  not.  Some  270  hunts  met  legally  on  Saturday  killing  a  total  of  91  foxes  -  only  four  were  accidentally  killed  by  hounds.  But  anti-hunt  campaigners  said  there  had  been  widespread  intimidation  of  activists  monitoring  hunts.  Countryside  Alliance  chairman  John  Jackson  said  that  Saturday  had  been  a  ""massive  demonstration  by  the  rural  community  of  support  for  hunting"".  People  had  turned  out  ""to  show  en  masse  that  the  Hunting  Act  was  a  bad  law"",  he  said  adding  that  foxes  and  other  animals  had  been  killed  ""legally""  as  far  as  he  was  aware.  |||    Although  hunting  with  dogs  is  now  a  criminal  offence,  exercising  hounds,  chasing  a  scent  trail  and  flushing  out  foxes  to  be  shot  are  still  legal.  Addressing  claims  that  the  new  law  was  unenforceable,  Mr  Michael  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  Programme:  ""There  has  been  a  lot  of  spin  about  this  by  those  that  support  hunting.  ""The  reality  is  that  the  law  is  very  clear.  You  can't  chase  wild  mammals  with  a  pack  of  dogs,  whether  the  wild  mammal  is  a  fox  or  a  deer.  ""If  people  do  so  and  pretend  they're  not  it's  going  to  become  very  clear.  You  can't  hunt  accidentally.""  Mr  Michael  also  denied  the  hunting  ban  had  led  to  a  breakdown  of  trust  between  the  government  and  rural  communities.  He  said  most  people  living  in  the  countryside  were  more  concerned  with  issues  like  the  economy,  the  health  service  and  their  children's  future  than  hunting.  |||    But  the  League  Against  Cruel  Sports  claimed  the  new  act  had  been  broken  even  though  the  numbers  of  foxes  killed  had  fallen.  Thousands  of  hunt  supporters  turned  out  at  270  hunts  across  England  and  Wales  on  the  first  day  of  the  ban,  with  anti-hunt  groups  sending  out  100  monitors  to  check  the  law  was  not  being  broken.  There  were  only  four  arrests  -  over  alleged  hunting  of  hares  in  Wiltshire  -  although  it  was  not  clear  whether  they  were  made  under  the  Hunting  Act.  |||    They  have  been  released  on  bail  but  police  say  they  may  face  prosecution  under  new  poaching  laws.  But  Penny  Little,  who  monitored  the  Bicester  Hunt  in  Oxfordshire,  said  she  had  witnessed  ""gratuitous,  spiteful  killing  of  foxes"".  If  people  tried  to  ""run  circles  around  this  law""  the  only  outcome  would  be  that  it  was  tightened  up,  she  said.  Mike  Hobday,  from  the  League  Against  Cruel  Sports,  said  video  evidence  of  the  law  being  broken  would  be  passed  onto  police.  He  said  intimidation  seemed  to  have  been  widespread  and  called  on  hunts  to  do  more  to  stop  their  supporters  intimidating  anti-hunt  activists  videoing  hunts.  But  Mr  Jackson,  who  had  been  at  the  Bicester  Hunt  in  Oxfordshire,  denied  there  was  any  intimidation. "

1,"Campaigners  attack  MTV  'sleaze'  |||    MTV  has  been  criticised  for  ""incessant  sleaze""  by  television  indecency  campaigners  in  the  US.  |||    The  Parents  Television  Council  (PTC),  which  monitors  violence  and  sex  on  TV,  said  the  cable  music  channel  offered  the  ""cheapest  form""  of  programming.  The  group  is  at  the  forefront  of  a  vociferous  campaign  to  clean  up  American  television.  But  a  spokeswoman  for  MTV  said  it  was  ""unfair  and  inaccurate""  to  single  out  MTV  for  criticism.  |||    The  PTC  monitored  MTV's  output  for  171  hours  from  20  March  to  27  March  2004,  during  the  channel's  Spring  Break  coverage.  In  its  report  -  MTV  Smut  Peddlers:  Targeting  Kids  with  Sex,  Drugs  and  Alcohol  -  the  PTC  said  it  witnessed  3,056  flashes  of  nudity  or  sexual  situations  and  2,881  verbal  references  to  sex.  Brent  Bozell,  PTC  president  and  conservative  activist  said:  ""MTV  is  blatantly  selling  raunchy  sex  to  kids.  ""Compared  to  broadcast  television  programmes  aimed  at  adults,  MTV's  programming  contains  substantially  more  sex,  foul  language  and  violence  -  and  MTV's  shows  are  aimed  at  children  as  young  as  12.  ""There's  no  question  that  TV  influences  the  attitudes  and  perceptions  of  young  viewers,  and  MTV  is  deliberately  marketing  its  raunch  to  millions  of  innocent  children.""  |||    The  watchdog  decided  to  look  at  MTV's  programmes  after  Janet  Jackson's  infamous  ""wardrobe  malfunction""  at  last  year's  Super  Bowl.  The  breast-baring  incident  generated  500,000  complaints  and  CBS  -  which  is  owned  by  the  same  parent  company  as  MTV  -  was  quick  to  apologise.  MTV  spokeswoman  Jeannie  Kedas  said  the  network  follows  the  same  standards  as  broadcasters  and  reflects  the  culture  and  what  its  viewers  are  interested  in.  ""It's  unfair  and  inaccurate  to  paint  MTV  with  that  brush  of  irresponsibility,""  she  said.  ""We  think  it's  underestimating  young  people's  intellect  and  level  of  sophistication.""  Ms  Kedas  also  highlighted  the  fact  MTV  won  an  award  in  2004  for  the  Fight  for  Your  Rights  series  that  focused  on  issues  such  as  sexual  health  and  tolerance. "

0,"Rich  grab  half  Colombia  poor  fund  |||    Half  of  the  money  put  aside  by  the  Colombian  government  to  help  the  country's  poor  is  benefiting  people  who  do  not  need  it,  a  study  has  found.  |||    A  total  of  24.2  trillion  pesos  ($10.2bn;  £5.5bn)  is  earmarked  for  subsidies  for  the  poor,  the  government  department  for  planning  said.  But  it  also  found  12.1  trillion  pesos  was  going  to  the  richest  part  of  the  population,  rather  than  to  those  in  need.  Sound  distribution  of  the  cash  could  cut  poverty  levels  to  36%  from  53%,  the  government  believes.  ""Resources  are  more  than  enough  to  reduce  poverty  and  there  is  no  need  for  more  tax  reforms  but  a  better  distribution,""  deputy  planning  director  Jose  Leibovich  said.  |||    Colombia  has  a  population  of  about  44  million  and  half  lives  below  poverty  line.  However,  some  large  properties  are  paying  less  in  tax  as  they  are  situated  inside  poor  areas,  which  benefit  from  cheaper  utilities  such  as  electricity  and  water,  government  research  found.  Government  expenditure  in  areas  such  as  pensions,  public  services,  education,  property  and  health  should  be  revised,  Mr  Leibovich  said.  He  added  that  the  government  is  now  examining  the  report,  but  warned  there  would  be  no  easy  solution  to  the  problem.  With  a  good  distribution  of  such  subsidies  and  economic  growth  of  just  2%,  by  2019  poverty  could  fall  as  low  as  15.3%,  he  said. "

2,"Manchester  wins  Labour  conference  |||    The  Labour  Party  will  hold  its  2006  autumn  conference  in  Manchester  and  not  Blackpool,  it  has  been  confirmed.  |||    The  much  trailed  decision  was  ratified  by  Labour's  ruling  National  Executive  Committee  in  a  break  with  the  traditional  choice  of  a  seaside  venue.  It  will  be  the  first  time  since  1917  that  the  party  has  chosen  Manchester  to  host  the  annual  event.  Blackpool  will  get  the  much  smaller  February  spring  conference  instead  in  what  will  be  seen  as  a  placatory  move.  |||    For  years  the  main  political  parties  have  rotated  between  Blackpool,  Bournemouth  and  Brighton.  And  the  news  the  much  larger  annual  conference  is  not  to  gather  in  Blackpool  will  be  seen  as  a  blow  in  the  coastal  resort.  In  1998  the  party  said  it  would  not  return  to  Blackpool  but  did  so  in  2002.  The  following  year  Bournemouth  hosted  the  event  before  the  party  signed  a  two  year  deal  for  Brighton  to  host  the  autumn  conference.  |||    Colin  Asplin,  Blackpool  Hotel  Association  said:  ""We  have  tried  very  hard  to  make  sure  they  come  back  to  Blackpool.  ""Obviously  we  have  failed  in  that.  I  just  hope  Manchester  can  handle  the  crowds.  ""It  amazes  me  that  the  Labour  Party,  which  is  a  working  class  party,  doesn't  want  to  come  to  the  main  working  class  resort  in  the  country.""  The  exact  cost  to  Blackpool  in  terms  of  lost  revenue  for  hotel  accommodation  is  not  yet  known  but  it  is  thought  that  block  bookings  will  be  taken  at  the  major  Manchester  hotels  after  the  official  announcement.

1,"Muslim  group  attacks  TV  drama  24  |||    A  British  Muslim  group  has  criticised  the  new  series  of  US  drama  24,  which  is  about  to  be  aired  on  Sky  One,  claiming  it  portrays  Islam  unfairly.  |||    The  Muslim  Council  of  Britain  has  complained  to  broadcasting  watchdog  Ofcom.  It  says  the  programme  breaches  editorial  guidelines.  The  group's  members  met  with  Sky  executives  on  Tuesday  after  viewing  previews  of  the  first  five  episodes.  The  drama,  now  in  its  fourth  series,  begins  on  Sunday  evening.  The  new  series  portrays  a  Muslim  family  as  a  sleeper  terrorist  cell.  The  Muslim  Council  of  Britain  said  in  a  statement:  ""We  are  greatly  concerned  by  the  unremittingly  hostile  and  unbalanced  portrayal  of  Muslims  in  this  series  of  24  based  upon  a  preview  of  the  first  five  episodes  that  we  have  seen.""  ""There  is  not  a  single  positive  Muslim  character  in  the  storyline  to  date.  At  a  time  when  negative  stereotypes  of  Muslims  are  on  the  increase  we  feel  that  Sky  -  as  a  major  UK  broadcaster  -  has  a  responsibility  to  challenge  these  insidious  views,  not  help  to  reinforce  them.""  But  Sky  denied  the  programme  breached  broadcasting  guidelines.  A  spokesperson  said:  ""During  a  useful  meeting  yesterday,  Sky  listened  to  the  concerns  raised  by  representatives  of  the  council.  Sky  does  not  believe  that  the  episodes  that  it  has  reviewed  to  date  breach  Ofcom's  programme  code.""  Fox  TV,  which  shows  the  series  in  the  US,  is  broadcasting  public  service  announcements  showing  Muslims  in  a  positive  light  after  complaints  about  the  series. "

2,"Student  'fee  factor'  played  down  |||    A  rise  has  been  recorded  in  the  number  of  students  from  south  of  the  border  applying  to  universities  in  Scotland.  |||    However,  Lifelong  Learning  Minister  Jim  Wallace  said  that  this  would  not  result  in  Scottish  students  missing  out.  Applications  from  England  and  Wales  rose  by  17%  between  January  2005  and  the  previous  year,  up  23,600  to  27,700.  Fears  had  been  expressed  that  a  flood  of  ""fee  refugees""  would  try  to  avoid  top-up  fees  of  up  to  £3,000  a  year  being  introduced  in  England.  In  June  last  year,  Mr  Wallace  announced  proposals  to  increase  tuition  fees  for  English  students  studying  in  Scotland  by  £2,000  in  an  attempt  to  prevent  a  cross-border  flood,  although  no  figure  has  yet  been  agreed.  Legislation  to  introduce  the  top-up  fees  in  England  is  not  due  to  take  effect  until  autumn  2006  and  students  who  start  before  then  will  not  have  to  pay  additional  fees  at  all.  |||    The  figures  were  made  public  on  Thursday  by  admissions  service  Ucas.  Universities  Scotland,  which  represents  university  principals,  claimed  that  an  increase  in  applications  did  not  amount  to  Scottish  students  being  squeezed  out.  Director,  David  Caldwell,  said  some  students  could  be  applying  in  an  attempt  to  avoid  the  possible  increase  in  annual  fees  at  English  universities,  but  this  was  not  a  major  factor.  He  told  BBC  Radio  Scotland's  Good  Morning  Scotland  programme:  ""The  reason  people  are  opting  for  Scottish  universities  is  that  they  are  perceived  as  being  of  very  high  quality,  they  offer  very  attractive  courses  and  Scotland  is  seen  as  a  very  attractive  place  to  study.  |||    ""They  know  that  when  they  take  up  their  studies  in  2006  they  will  be  hit  by  top-up  fees  if  they  are  going  to  a  university  in  England  and  that  may  be  part  of  the  reason  why  the  numbers  coming  to  Scotland  are  so  inflated.  ""However,  it  does  not  mean  that  we  will  see  thousands  of  additional  students  from  England  studying  here.""  Mr  Wallace  agreed  and  said  the  figures  had  to  be  looked  at  in  context.  He  explained  that  when  applications  were  translated  into  acceptances,  the  number  was  not  huge  -  an  additional  figure  of  about  200.  |||    Also,  the  picture  was  further  blurred  by  the  fact  that  applications  from  Wales,  where  there  are  no  plans  for  top-up  fees,  have  also  risen,  by  19%.  Mr  Wallace  said:  ""Accepting  students  from  all  parts  of  the  world  does  show  the  high  regard  in  which  Scottish  higher  education  is  held,  not  just  in  Britain.  ""We  want  to  make  sure  that  when  students  are  making  their  choice,  they  do  so  on  the  nature  of  the  course  and  not  because  they  are  under  some  sort  of  financial  pressure  to  go  to  Scotland.  ""We  do  not  want  to  have  a  situation  where  it  becomes  impossible  for  Scottish  students  to  get  places  at  Scottish  universities  because  we  are  seen  as  the  cheap  option.  ""Very  often  the  quality  of  the  university  experience  is  enhanced  by  the  fact  there  are  students  coming  from  a  wide  range  of  backgrounds  so  it  would  be  wrong  to  go  the  other  way  and  start  excluding  students.""

""I'm  delighted  to  have  won  against  such  a  good  opponent  in  a  tournament  of  this  importance,""  said  Soderling.  ""I  was  really  on  form,  my  service  was  good  and  I  really  liked  playing  on  the  synthetic  surface.""  Soderling,  the  world  number  37,  shrugged  off  a  nervous  start  to  take  the  opening  set  on  his  first  set  point.  A  change  in  approach  from  fourth  seed  Stepanek  in  the  second  set  paid  dividends  as  he  took  it  on  a  tie-break,  but  Soderling's  superior  power  proved  too  much  in  the  third.

3,"Aragones  angered  by  racism  fine  |||    Spain  coach  Luis  Aragones  is  furious  after  being  fined  by  The  Spanish  Football  Federation  for  his  comments  about  Thierry  Henry.  |||    The  66-year-old  criticised  his  3000  euros  (£2,060)  punishment  even  though  it  was  far  below  the  maximum  penalty.  ""I  am  not  guilty,  nor  do  I  accept  being  judged  for  actions  against  the  image  of  the  sport,""  he  said.  ""I'm  not  a  racist  and  I've  never  lacked  sporting  decorum.  I've  never  done  that  and  I  have  medals  for  sporting  merit.""  Aragones  was  handed  the  fine  on  Tuesday  after  making  racist  remarks  about  Henry  to  Arsenal  team-mate  and  Spanish  international  Jose  Reyes  last  October.  |||    The  Spanish  Football  Federation  at  first  declined  to  take  action  against  Aragones,  but  was  then  requested  to  do  so  by  Spain's  anti-violence  commission.  The  fine  was  far  less  than  the  expected  amount  of  about  £22,000  or  even  the  suspension  of  his  coaching  licence.  Arsenal  boss  Arsene  Wenger,  who  was  fined  £15,000  in  December  for  accusing  Manchester  United  striker  Ruud  van  Nistelrooy  of  cheating,  believes  that  Aragones'  punishment  was  too  lenient.  ""You  compare  his  fine  and  my  fine,  and  if  you  consider  his  was  for  racist  abuse,  then  you  seem  to  get  away  with  it  more  in  Spain  than  you  should,""  Wenger  said.  ""He  shouldn't  have  said  what  he  said,  and  how  much  money  is  enough,  I  don't  know  but  it  doesn't  look  a  big  punishment.""  However,  Aragones  insists  the  fine  is  unjustified  and  unfair.  ""I  have  been  treated  like  Islero  (the  bull  that  killed  famous  bullfighter  Manolete),""  said  Aragones  on  hearing  he  had  been  fined  for  his  actions.  ""I  have  not  liked  one  thing  about  this  whole  affair  and  I  do  not  agree  with  the  sanction.  They  have  looked  for  a  scapegoat.""  Spain's  anti-violence  commission  must  now  ratify  the  Spanish  FA's  decision  and  has  until  next  week  to  announce  its  verdict.  Aragones  has  10  days  to  appeal,  and  the  commission  can  also  appeal.  Alberto  Flores,  president  of  the  Spanish  FA's  disciplinary  committee,  said  no-one  in  the  committee  felt  Aragones  was  a  racist  nor  had  ""acted  in  a  racist  way.""  ""A  fine,  the  highest  we  could  apply,  is  sufficient  punishment.  Suspension  would  have  been  a  bit  exaggerated,""  Flores  told  sports  daily  Marca. "

McFly  won  the  best  pop  act  prize,  and  Gwen  Stefani  picked  up  the  best  international  female  artist  award.  Eminem  won  the  male  prize.  |||    Best  British  male  artist  winner  Mike  Skinner  -  aka  The  Streets  -  does  not  usually  attend  award  ceremonies,  but  the  Birmingham  hip-hop  artist  performed  his  hit  Dry  Your  Eyes  at  the  ceremony.  However,  he  did  not  collect  his  prize.  A  bandmate  informed  the  crowd  Skinner  was  ""in  the  toilet"".  After  beating  Amy  Winehouse,  Jamelia,  Natasha  Bedingfield  and  PJ  Harvey  to  the  best  British  female  prize,  Joss  Stone  said:  ""I  don't  know  what  to  say.  I  don't  like  doing  this  at  all.  I'd  like  to  thank  my  family  for  being  really  supportive  and  everybody  that  made  my  record  with  me.""  ""I  don't  even  know  what  to  do  right  now.  Thank  you  all  you  guys  for  voting  for  me,  I  feel  sick  right  now.""  Viewers  of  digital  music  TV  channel  MTV  Base  voted  Stone  the  winner  in  the  best  urban  act  category.  |||    Little  Britain  comedy  duo  Matt  Lucas  and  David  Walliams  presented  the  best  song  prize  to  Robbie  Williams  dressed  as  his  former  Take  That  colleagues  Gary  Barlow  and  Howard  Donald,  leading  him  to  quip  he  was  ""always  the  talented  man  of  the  band"".  |||    Williams'  track  beat  songs  by  Will  Young,  Queen,  Kate  Bush  and  Joy  Division  in  a  vote  by  BBC  Radio  2  listeners  to  mark  25  years  of  the  UK  music  industry  ceremony.  It  is  his  15th  Brit  award,  having  already  received  10  solo  awards  and  four  with  Take  That.  He  told  the  audience:  ""I'm  just  amazed  that  my  career  keeps  going.""  Keane  frontman  Tom  Chaplin  thanked  fans  for  enduring  ""rubbish  gigs""  after  they  won  the  British  breakthrough  act  prize.  He  added:  ""A  lot  of  people  don't  think  it's  cool  that  we've  had  the  guts  to  be  ourselves  but  it's  a  vital  part  of  who  we  are  as  a  band  and  receiving  this  is  recognition  of  that.""  |||    Natasha  Bedingfield  -  in  the  running  for  best  British  female  and  best  pop  act  -  performed  with  her  brother  Daniel  for  the  first  time  at  Wednesday's  event.  |||    The  chart-topping  siblings  duetted  on  the  Chaka  Khan  hit  Ain't  Nobody.  Meanwhile,  Joss  Stone  performed  Right  To  Be  Wrong  backed  by  a  gospel  choir,  while  Lemar  and  Jamelia  performed  the  Robert  Palmer  track  Addicted  To  Love.  Bob  Geldof  won  a  prize  for  his  outstanding  contribution  to  music.  Of  the  15  Brit  awards  for  achievements  in  2004,  10  were  won  by  artists  tipped  in  the  BBC  News  website's  Sound  of  2004  list  of  artists  to  watch,  published  at  the  start  of  last  year.  Scissor  Sisters,  Franz  Ferdinand,  Keane,  Joss  Stone  and  McFly  were  all  in  the  Sound  of  2004  top  10.  The  other  five  Brits  winners  were  already  established  before  Sound  of  2004  was  compiled.  The  ceremony  will  be  televised  on  ITV1  on  Thursday.  |||      |||    I'm  speechless.  Best  song  of  the  last  25  years?  Yeah  right.  |||    I  very  much  doubt  that  'Angels'  was  even  the  best  song  of  the  week  that  it  came  out.  Like  every  track  Robbie  has  released  as  a  single,  it's  a  blatant  but  poor  facsimile  of  something  that  someone  else  has  done  better  before.  |||    Give  us  a  break...!!!  |||    Best  song  in  25  years,  you  must  be  joking.  Its  good  if  you  like  that  sort  of  thing,  but  really!  |||    Listened  to  Angels  on  Radio  1  this  morning  when  I  was  driving  into  work.  Had  not  heard  it  for  a  while.  I  love  Robs  voice,  the  lyrics  and  tune.  Perfection!  |||    As  usual,  the  public  have  short  memories  when  it  comes  to  voting  for  ""the  greatest"".  There  must  be  more  than  a  dozen  songs  in  the  last  25  years  that  deserve  this  award  more.  It's  not  exactly  groundbreaking.  Presumably,  the  age  range  that  could  be  bothered  to  vote  is  is  pretty  low...  |||    I'm  actually  embarrassed  to  be  British  if  that  is  the  best  song  we  have  produced  in  the  last  25  years!!  |||    What  about  The  Specials  -  Ghost  Town,  The  Buzzcocks  -  Ever  Fallen  in  Love  With  Someone...  Happy  Mondays  -  Kinky  Afro,  McAlmont  &  Butler  -  Yes,  Joy  Division  -  Love  Will  Tear  Us  Apart...  Angels  is  middle-of-the-road  rubbish.  |||    Angels  is  a  awful  piece  of  sentimental  claptrap.  It's  musically  and  lyrically  inept;  and  fantastically  overrated,  a  bit  like  Mr  Williams  himself.  This  result  isn't  very  surprising  though,  The  Brits  has  a  long  history  of  celebrating  rubbish  music!  |||    Best  of  the  last  25  years?  Maybe.  Cunning  to  make  the  timescale  not  include  Stairway  to  Heaven  or  Bohemian  Rhapsody,  but  it  does  kind  of  make  it  a  bit  of  a  hollow  award  really.  Not  much  competition  in  the  last  25  years  after  all.  |||    It's  alright  for  a  pop  song  -  but  the  best  song  of  the  last  25  years???  |||    There  is  no  way  on  earth  that  song  should  have  been  voted  the  best  of  the  last  25  years....it's  a  travesty.  |||    Rubbish!  Who  voted  it  for  it  to  be  included  in  any  list?  I  am  a  regular  listener  to  Radio  2  but  I  don't  recall  the  invitation  to  vote  for  this  bland,  slushy  rubbish  which  might  appeal  to  the  masses  who  wouldn't  know  a  good  song  if  it  jumped  up  and  bit  them  on  the  nose  but  is  certainly  NOT  the  best  song  of  the  last  25  years.  How  depressing  and  just  when  we  thought  manufactured  'pop'  was  on  the  way  out  -  where  on  earth  did  this  dreadful  list  appear  from?  |||    While  I  am  biassed  in  that  I  thought  Love  Will  Tear  Us  Apart  should  have  won,  in  all  seriousness,  I  think  that  the  best  song  of  the  last  25  years  should  not  include  songs  less  than  5  years  old  as  that  would  exclude  songs  which  are  popular  because  of  novelty.  Then  again,  well  done  Robbie,  good  show.  |||    You've  got  to  be  kidding.  |||    Angels  is  a  great  song,  but  not  the  best  song  of  the  last  25  years.  Only  the  best  song  to  be  up  for  nomination  at  the  Brits.  |||    I  think  Angels  is  a  great  song  and  deserved  to  be  in  the  run  up  for  this  award  but  I  don't  think  its  the  best  song  from  the  past  25  years!  Right  enough,  it  is  better  than  some  of  the  others  in  this  catergory,  for  example,  what  was  Will  Young  doing  being  nominated  in  the  first  place  -  he  is  alright  but  the  song  isn't  that  good!  I'm  happy  for  Robbie  himself  though!  |||    Best  song  in  the  last  25  years?  What  a  Joke!  Think  of  all  the  great  rock  and  pop  songs  released  in  the  80s  and  pretty  much  all  of  them  are  better  than  Angels.  Phil  Collins  doesn't  deserve  awards  for  all  the  good  songs  he  wrote?  Angels  is  an  overrated  song,  that  got  tiresome  even  before  you  had  finished  listening  to  it.  Soppy  rubbish  at  best.  Hopefully  manufactured  rubbish  will  die  down  soon,  and  let  the  real  artists  who  worked  hard  for  there  glory  receive  awards.  |||    So  boringly  obvious  and  typical  of  the  bland  nature  of  mainstream  music  in  Britain  today,  for  me  it's  proof  that  music  and  democracy  just  don't  mix.  Still,  at  least  it  wasn't  Will  Young...  |||    Oh  it's  all  just  a  bit  of  fun.  People  take  these  awards  too  seriously!  Robbie  has  millions  of  loyal  fans,  while  even  non-fans  know  the  words  to  angels.  Him  winning  obviously  reflects  who  votes  in  these  awards.  Personally  I  wanted  Will  Young  to  win,  but  that  was  not  really  due  to  his  musical  talent!  |||    I  hate  the  song,  all  it  brings  back  is  memories  of  school  discos  and  no-one  to  slow-dance  with!  |||    I  agree  about  Angels.  I  never  get  fed  up  hearing  it.  Whenever  the  song  comes  on  the  radio  I  turn  the  radio  up,  smile  and  sing  along  (very  badly,  that  is  why  the  radio  has  to  be  turned  up  to  drown  my  voice  out).  The  song  makes  me  calm  and  serene  and  happy.  Well  done  Robbie.  |||    I  think  that  although  Robbie  Williams  is  a  good  performer,  that  Angels  isn't  really  that  good  a  song.  It  certainly  isn't  anywhere  near  as  good  as  Love  Will  Tear  Us  Apart  by  Joy  Division  or  Wuthering  Heights  by  Kate  Bush.  |||    Angels  is  a  fantastic  song.  All  credit  to  Robbie  Williams  and  Guy  Chambers.  It's  a  song  that  will  be  played  forever  and  bridges  all  age  groups.  |||    Robbie  did  in  no  way  deserve  that  mantle.  Whenever  we  have  these  awards  it  is  always  'artists'  from  the  past  five  years  that  seem  to  win  the  best  of  the  best...We  forget  about  the  late  80s  and  early  90s  for  example.  They  weren't  cool  at  the  time,  but  because  they  are  cool  again  now  shows  that  the  songs  have  greater  longevity  than  people  think.  |||    Yes  Angels  is  the  best  song  since  the  past  25  years,  because  it  touches  the  soul  as  it  carries  a  lot  of  meaning.  |||    I've  always  disliked  Angels  intensely.  I  believe  it  to  be  symbolic  of  the  general  capacity  of  British  pre-teens,  teens  and  middle  aged  women  to  accept  low  quality/  low  aspirational  music  as  ""classic""  songwriting.  It's  'orrible.  It  seems  obvious  to  me  that  people  who  like  Robbie  are  people  who  don't  particularly  like  music  all  that  much.  Folks  without  collections;  folks  who  have  never  engaged  in  that  madness  one  experiences  when  falling  under  the  spell  of  pop  music.  Angels  adds  nothing  -  it  is  merely  an  irritating  distraction  -  a  wasp  that  refuses  to  go  away  on  a  summer's  afternoon  picnic.  What  a  dreadful  result.  If  you  voted  for  it  -  you  should  feel  ashamed  of  yourself  -  you  probably  only  know  a  dozen  songs  or  so  don't  you  -  so  where  do  get  off  applying  this  uninformed  filter  and  casting  this  ridiculous  vote.  Booo  hisss  |||    Angels,  best  song?  You  are  kidding,  right?  Last  five  years  I  might  be  willing  to  accept,  but  25,  no  way.  Did  whoever  voted  for  this  actually  have  ANY  music  knowledge  prior  to,  say,  1995?  Really  quite  insulting  to  the  British  music  industry  of  the  past  quarter  of  a  century.  |||    No  surprise  about  Robbie  Williams  considering  the  list.  Where  on  earth  did  the  nominations  list  come  from????  Compiled  by  an  eleven  year-old  girl  perhaps??  I  mean,  Will  Young?  Come  on.  |||    What  a  load  of  crap,  best  song  in  the  last  25  years  -  I  don't  think  so!!  What  about  all  the  REAL  artists  out  there  over  the  last  25  years  -  the  list  is  endless,  but  Robbie  Williams  doesn't  even  come  close.  |||    What  a  joke.  That  song  has  become  such  a  bane  to  me  that  I  have  developed  a  Pavlovian  response  to  the  word  'Angels'  where  I  thrash  around,  and  scream  ""no  no  no  no  no""  until  someone  tells  me  ""the  radio's  off"".  Why  a  half-baked  cheesy  ditty  like  Angels,  which  has  become  the  anthem  for  millions  of  romantic  sops  (think  how  many  times  it  was  sung  on  Pop  Idol  for  example,  and  by  whom),  should  be  voted  the  best  song  of  the  past  25  years,  is  beyond  me.  If  this  is  the  song  against  which  all  others  are  judged,  then  musicians  may  as  well  give  up.  |||    Why  do  we  reward  mediocrity  so  highly  in  this  country??  The  initial  list  was  very  weak  anyway,  but  Angels  the  best  song  of  the  last  25  years!!!!  I  think  not,  I  didn't  realize  Radio  2  had  so  many  listeners  under  the  age  of  10!!  |||    People  have  such  short  memories!  A  great  song  yes,  but  the  best  of  the  last  25  years?  Not  a  chance.  I  think  the  person  as  opposed  to  the  song  has  been  voted  for  here.  |||    The  Great  British  Public  at  work  again.  It's  a  mediocre,  sentimental  and  safe  song.  Granted,  it's  not  too  bad,  either.  But  can  it  stand  up  against  ANYTHING  by  The  Smiths  (in  particular  ""How  Soon  is  Now?"")  or  anything  from  the  Stone  Roses'  first  album?  Nope.  |||    No,  Because  I'm  not  female  and  I'm  not  10!  |||    Ok  I  like  Robbie  and  Angels  is  a  decent  song.  But  it  is  no  way  the  best  song  of  the  past  25  years!  The  shortlist  wasn't  great  but  him  winning  it  is  a  joke!  |||    Predictable  and  laughable.  |||    The  success  of  Angels  at  this  years  Brits  reflects  poorly  on  the  state  of  British  music  over  the  last  25  years.  The  British  public  are  brainwashed  by  the  corporate  pulp  that  is  presneted  to  them  as  cutting  edge  music  and  true  talent  is  being  sadly  missed.  Whilst  Angels  is  a  popular  song  it  is  not  even  the  best  song  in  Robbie's  repertoire  never  mind  best  song  of  the  last  25  years.  |||    I  am  a  huge  Robbie  fan  and  love  that  song.  But  I  think  there  are  a  lot  more  outstanding  songs  /  music  out  there  that  influenced  music  today,  unfortunately  they  were  left  out  of  the  list.  |||    Have  Radio  2  listeners  even  heard  of  Joy  Division?  A  band  who,  through  two  albums,  have  had  a  bigger  impact  on  music,  and  continue  to  do  so,  over  the  last  25  years  than  Robbie  Williams  ever  will.  |||    No  doubt  about  it.  There's  not  a  song  done  by  anyone  with  more  emotion  and  feeling.  Some  people  will  adopt  their  slightly  snobby  stances,  but  Angels  has  hit  home  with  a  far  larger  audience  than  any  other  song.  |||    It  should  have  been  Joy  Division.Those  guys  have  played  an  influential  part  in  shaping  modern  day  music  while  Angels  remains  yet  another  pop  song.  I  sincerely  do  not  believe  that  in  25  years  from  now,  the  most  influential  artists  will  argue  that  Robbie  Williams  inspired  their  art  in  the  way  that  the  Byrds,  the  Beatles  and  Nick  Drake  have  done  for  music  today.  |||    Yes!!  I  think  its  a  brilliantly  written  song  with  different  meanings  to  different  people.  There  were  other  great  songs  in  the  category...  but  somebody  had  to  win!  Robbie  was  a  deserved  winner.  |||    I  am  astounded  that  such  a  second-rate  record  has  beaten  such  a  line  up  of  amazing  songs!  it's  a  terrible  song,  voted  for  by  the  masses  who  don't  have  the  brains  to  appreciate  innovative  and  exciting  music.  |||    The  best  song  of  the  past  25  years?  Really?  Come  on,  this  is  surely  a  joke?  No?  I  think  I  need  a  long  lie  down...  |||    It  just  goes  to  show  that  the  british  public  do  not  have  a  clue  about  good  quality  music  when  they  pick  Robbie  Williams  over  the  beautifully  talented  Kate  Bush  and  Joy  Division.  I  suppose  it's  confirmed  one  thing  -  the  British  public  are  consistently  dull  :-  &lt;(  |||    No  offence  Robbie,  but  pleeease!  There  must  be  a  thousand  better  songs  than  a  formulated  cheesy  pop  song  for  kids.  No  one  agrees  with  this  and  quite  frankly  it  is  an  embarassment  to  the  integrity  of  British  music,  and  a  further  nail  in  the  coffin!  |||    I  think  Robbie  deserves  it,  he  has  been  the  most  iconic  of  any  stars  we  have  had  in  Britain  since  John  Lennon  and  is  an  idol  to  millions  worldwide.  Anybody  who  says  he  doesn't  deserve  it  is  jealous  of  his  success.  The  only  real  challenger  was  Queen  but  hey,  Another  One  Bites  the  Dust!!  |||    Obviously  all  the  Karaoke  singers  in  the  UK  voted  for  it.  |||    If  this  is  the  best  song  of  the  last  25  years  then  the  British  Music  industry  is  in  trouble.  Sure  Robbie  is  talented  and  produces  excellent  material,  but  this  is  not  the  best  record.  |||    A  sad  day  for  music  |||    It's  not  the  type  of  music  I  normally  like,  but  even  as  a  diehard  rock  fan,  I  recognise  that  it  is  a  good  song  and  appelas  to  most  people.  That's  why  it  has  been  voted  best  song  of  the  last  25  years.  It's  a  good  all-rounder.  Just  like  Robbie.  |||    Best  song  in  25  years?  Since  1980?  I'm  confused.  ""Angels""  isn't  a  bad  song.  It's  a  nice,  catchy,  formulaic  anthem  that  ticks  all  the  boxes.  But  this  is  not  great  music.  If  anything  it's  regressive.  Bland  even.  I  suppose  it's  just  more  evidence  of  how  redundant  the  Brit  Awards  have  become.  |||    Granted  angels  is  a  good  song,  however  it  really  wasn't  up  against  any  other  proper  competition.  The  Queen's  song  was  lackluster,  and  apart  from  Kate  Bush,  the  other  choices  were  pathetic!  Also,  why  weren't  the  Stones  there,  David  Bowie,  etc,  there  are  so  many  greater  songs  than  Angels...I  wonder  if  it  was  simply  the  fact  that  Robbie  wasn't  getting  more  awards  so  they  had  to  make  one  up  for  him!  |||    Best  song  of  the  last  25  years?  What  a  ridiculuous  concept,  and  an  even  more  ridiculous  winner.  Sigh.  On  the  upside,  at  least  it  wasn't  Bohemian  Rhapsody,  for  which  we  should  all  be  thankful.  |||    Angels  is  without  doubt  a  great  song  but  I  really  don't  think  it  deserves  the  title  of  best  song  in  25  years.perhaps  the  vote  had  more  to  do  with  teenage  opinion  on  Robbies'  goodlooks  than  the  actual  song!!!  Don't  get  me  wrong,  I'm  not  disputing  his  looks,  but  there  are  more  deserved  winners.  |||    It  would  have  been  a  travesty  had  Angels  not  won.  Without  Angels,  Robbie  Williams  may  well  not  be  where  he  is  now,  and  Britain  would  have  been  deprived  of  one  of  its  most  charismatic  and  talented  performing  artists.  It  has  to  be  seen  performed  live,  with  125,000  people  singing  along  to  be  fully  appreciated.  Well  done  Rob.  |||    I  find  it  hard  to  believe  that  'Angels'  is  the  best  we  have  to  show  for  the  past  25  years!  I'm  rapidly  redifining  'best'  in  my  own  head  now  to  mean  'most  gratuitously  played  at  weddings  and  funerals  because  people  think  it  has  deep  meaning'.  What  about  Britpop?  Blur,  Oasis,  Suede,  Pulp...  not  only  making  fantastic  songs  but  also  making  changes,  doing  something  different.  Why  must  'best'  always  come  down  to  most  commercially  popular?  |||    I've  nothing  against  Robbie,  I  actually  like  his  music,  but  how  can  this  possibly  be  the  best  song  from  the  last  25year?  The  Brits  has  proved  to  be  nothing  more  than  a  bargaining  tool  between  the  pop  moguls  to  boost  band  profiles  and  record  sales.  The  same  goes  with  the  Scissor  Sisters,  I  think  this  is  a  superb  record  and  thoroughly  deserves  the  newcomer  award,  but  the  album  comes  no  where  near  U2's  new  record,  neither  are  they  in  the  same  league.  Once  again  there  have  been  some  baffling  discisions  made,  they  are  not  for  artisic  reasons,  but  for  profit.  |||    No  surprise  really,  it's  voted  for  by  the  general  public.  Since  when  did  they  have  taste  in  music?  |||    Personally  I  find  Angels  by  Robbie  Williams  to  be  one  of  the  most  irritating  songs  I  have  ever  heard!  |||    It  absolutely  deserved  to  win.  It  is  a  song  that  has  united  the  generations  and  will  continue  to  be  played  for  many  years  to  come.  |||    It's  an  absolute  joke,  however  most  of  the  original  25  were  very  poor  choices  as  well.  All  in  all  a  pretty  pointless  exercise  !  |||    The  song  is  overplayed  and  oversentimental.  Out  of  the  rather  poor  five  choices  that  were  left,  it  should  have  gone  to  either  Joy  Division  or  Queen.  I  suppose  we  should  be  thankful  that  it  didn't  end  up  in  the  hands  of  Will  Young  though.  |||    Although  it  has  nostalgia  value,  there  is  no  way  it  deserved  to  win.  Everybody  knows  the  words  to  Bohemian  Rhapsody,  Nothing  Compares  2  U,  etc.  Much  better  songs  and  more  timeless.  Give  it  to  someone  with  real  talent.  |||    Although  Angels  is  a  good  song  I  think  that  anyone  with  the  slightest  musical  taste  will  realise  that  this  is  not  the  best  song  of  the  last  25  years.  This  is  just  another  example  of  record  company  manipulation  to  keep  an  artist  in  the  public  eye.  Why  not  give  him  an  award  for  the  greatest  pair  of  trousers  if  that's  all  it  means! "

3,"Tindall  aiming  to  earn  Lions  spot  |||    Bath  and  England  centre  Mike  Tindall  believes  he  can  make  this  summer's  Lions  tour,  despite  missing  most  of  the  season  through  injury.  |||    The  World  Cup  winner  has  been  out  of  action  since  December,  having  damaged  both  his  shoulder  and  his  foot.  But  Tindall,  who  recently  signed  for  Bath's  west-country  rivals  Gloucester,  told  Rugby  Special  he  would  be  fit  in  time  for  the  tour  to  New  Zealand.  ""I'm  aiming  to  be  fit  by  18  April  and  hope  I  can  play  from  then,""  he  said.  ""I've  spoken  to  Sir  Clive  Woodward  and  he  understands  the  situation,  so  I  just  hope  that  I  can  get  on  the  tour.""  The  26-year-old  will  face  stiff  competition  for  those  centre  places  from  Brian  O'Driscoll,  Gordon  D'Arcy  and  Gavin  Henson,  and  is  aware  that  competition  is  intense.  |||    But  after  missing  out  on  the  2001  tour  to  Australia  with  a  knee  injury,  Tindall  says  he  will  be  happy  just  to  have  an  opportunity  to  wear  the  red  shirt.  ""I'm  quite  laid  back  about  it  to  be  honest  -  it's  quite  hard  for  me  to  expect  to  be  pushing  for  a  Test  spot,""  he  said.  ""But  after  what's  happened  this  season  at  least  Clive  knows  I'll  be  100%  fresh!""  |||    -  For  the  full  interview  with  Mike  Tindall  tune  into  this  Sunday's  Rugby  Special,  2340  on  BBC  Two "

0,"Japan  narrowly  escapes  recession  |||    Japan's  economy  teetered  on  the  brink  of  a  technical  recession  in  the  three  months  to  September,  figures  show.  |||    Revised  figures  indicated  growth  of  just  0.1%  -  and  a  similar-sized  contraction  in  the  previous  quarter.  On  an  annual  basis,  the  data  suggests  annual  growth  of  just  0.2%,  suggesting  a  much  more  hesitant  recovery  than  had  previously  been  thought.  A  common  technical  definition  of  a  recession  is  two  successive  quarters  of  negative  growth.  |||    The  government  was  keen  to  play  down  the  worrying  implications  of  the  data.  ""I  maintain  the  view  that  Japan's  economy  remains  in  a  minor  adjustment  phase  in  an  upward  climb,  and  we  will  monitor  developments  carefully,""  said  economy  minister  Heizo  Takenaka.  But  in  the  face  of  the  strengthening  yen  making  exports  less  competitive  and  indications  of  weakening  economic  conditions  ahead,  observers  were  less  sanguine.  ""It's  painting  a  picture  of  a  recovery...  much  patchier  than  previously  thought,""  said  Paul  Sheard,  economist  at  Lehman  Brothers  in  Tokyo.  Improvements  in  the  job  market  apparently  have  yet  to  feed  through  to  domestic  demand,  with  private  consumption  up  just  0.2%  in  the  third  quarter. "

1,"US  'to  raise  TV  indecency  fines'  |||    US  politicians  are  proposing  a  tough  new  law  aimed  at  cracking  down  on  indecency  and  bad  language  on  US  TV.  |||    Fines  of  up  to  $500,000  (£266,582)  could  be  imposed  each  time  broadcasters  transmit  nudity  or  profanities.  The  proposal,  unveiled  in  the  House  of  Representatives,  also  seeks  to  revoke  a  broadcaster's  licence  after  three  violations  have  been  committed.  The  exposure  of  Janet  Jackson's  breast  at  last  year's  Superbowl  landed  CBS  with  a  $550,000  (£293,264)  fine.  Entertainers  could  also  be  liable  for  fines  under  the  proposed  legisation  from  both  US  politcians  and  officials  from  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC).  A  Republican  senator  from  Kansas,  Sam  Brownbeck,  is  set  to  call  for  a  maximum  $3  million  (£1.6  million)  fine  for  repeated  violations.  |||    The  current  maximum  fine  stands  at  $32,500  (£17,320)  -  20  of  the  stations  in  the  CBS  network  were  each  penalised  these  lesser  amounts  for  the  Jackson  incident.  Republican  politician  Fred  Upton,  who  chairs  the  committee  responsible  for  broadcasting,  said  current  fines  are  ""more  of  a  cost  of  doing  business  rather  than  a  deterrent"".  Last  year's  Janet  Jackson  'wardrobe  malfunction'  encouraged  the  FCC  to  impose  tougher  rules,  but  the  US  Congress  adjourned  last  year  without  agreeing  on  a  new  level  of  fines.  New  figures  have  to  be  decided  before  new  legislation  can  be  put  before  President  Bush.  Certain  broadcasters,  like  Fox,  claim  the  material  they  carry  does  not  violate  indecency  laws  and  is  protected  under  the  right  to  free  speech. "

3,"Irish  finish  with  home  game  |||    Republic  of  Ireland  manager  Brian  Kerr  has  been  granted  his  wish  for  a  home  game  as  the  final  World  Cup  qualifier.  |||    Ireland  will  close  their  bid  to  reach  the  2006  finals  by  playing  Switzerland  in  Dublin  on  12  October  2005.  The  Republic  met  the  Swiss  in  their  final  Euro  2004  qualifier,  losing  2-0  away  and  missing  out  on  a  place  in  the  finals  in  Portugal.  The  Group  Four  fixtures  were  hammered  out  at  a  meeting  in  Dublin  on  Tuesday.

Manager  Brian  Kerr  and  FAI  officials  met  representatives  from  Switzerland,  France,  Cyprus,  Israel  and  the  Faroe  Islands  to  arrange  the  fixture  schedule.  Kerr  had  hoped  to  finish  with  a  clash  against  France,  but  got  the  reigning  European  champions  as  their  penultimate  home  match  on  7  September  2005.

0,"G7  backs  Africa  debt  relief  plan  |||    G7  finance  ministers  have  backed  plans  to  write  off  up  to  100%  of  the  debts  of  some  of  the  world's  poorest  countries.  |||    UK  chancellor  Gordon  Brown  said  the  London  meeting  of  the  world's  seven  richest  nations  would  be  remembered  as  ""the  100%  debt  relief  summit"".  Some  37  countries  could  benefit  after  a  case-by-case  review  by  bodies  including  the  World  Bank  and  the  IMF,  he  said.  But  the  US  says  it  cannot  support  Mr  Brown's  International  Finance  Facility  to  boost  aid  to  developing  countries.  BBC  correspondents  said  the  meeting  had  produced  some  movement  towards  the  UK's  ambitions,  but  much  work  was  needed.  Mr  Brown  said  it  was  a  major  breakthrough  for  the  international  organisations  to  offer  up  to  100%  multilateral  debt  relief  -  ""the  vast  bulk""  of  money  owed  by  the  poorest  countries.  |||    ""We  could  be  at  the  beginning  of  the  final  stage  of  the  process  where  the  debts  that  were  owed  by  the  poorest  countries,  built  up  over  20  or  30  years,  debts  that  are  simply  unpayable  in  the  real  world,  are  finally  taken  care  of,""  he  said.  He  added:  ""It  is  the  richest  countries  hearing  the  voices  of  the  poor.""  But  he  said  they  would  insist  on  government  reforms  and  the  need  for  transparency,  tackling  corruption  and  openness  from  both  the  poorest  and  richest  nations.  BBC  correspondent  Patrick  Bartlett  said  while  it  was  an  agreement  in  principle,  the  organisations  involved  now  have  to  look  at  how  it  would  work  in  practice.  Oxfam  senior  policy  adviser  Max  Lawson  welcomed  the  statement  and  said  G7  ministers  had  ""passed  the  first  hurdle  of  2005"".  |||    But  he  added:  ""They  need  to  move  quickly  to  turn  their  proposals  into  real  change  for  the  world's  poorest.  ""Two  million  children  will  die  needlessly  between  now  and  the  next  meeting  in  April.  If  rich  countries  are  going  to  keep  their  promises  to  tackle  obscene  poverty  they  need  deliver  -  and  deliver  quickly.""  Talks  are  continuing  on  how  to  finance  increased  overseas  development  assistance.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  is  to  look  at  a  proposal  to  use  its  gold  supplies  to  help  the  debt  relief  effort  when  it  meets  in  April.  Mr  Brown  said  G7  ministers  had  agreed  to  defer  debt  interest  payments  and  repayments  for  some  countries  affected  by  the  tsunami  until  the  end  of  2005.  But  UK  plans  for  an  International  Finance  Facility  (IFF)  to  help  deal  with  debt  in  the  developing  world  have  not  been  agreed.  Mr  Brown  wanted  to  provide  $10bn  (£5.38bn)  a  year  over  a  decade,  using  G7  backing  so  the  money  could  be  borrowed  up  front  on  financial  markets.  |||    It  is  a  key  element  of  his  proposals  for  a  modern  version  of  the  Marshall  Plan,  which  brought  US  aid  to  rebuild  Europe  after  World  War  II,  for  the  developing  world.  Mr  Brown  said  it  was  ""winning  support  every  day""  and  said  a  programme  had  been  agreed  to  draw  up  more  details  in  time  for  the  G8  summit  in  July.  But  US  Treasury  Under-Secretary  John  Taylor  said  the  US  could  not  support  the  IFF  because  of  its  ""legislative  process"".  ""The  US  is  completely  committed  to  poverty  reduction  and  providing  financing  to  do  that,""  he  said.  ""But  this  particular  mechanism  does  not  work  for  the  United  States.  It  works  for  other  countries,  and  that  is  fine.""  Earlier,  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme  the  US  had  increased  support  for  Africa  in  the  past  four  years  from  $1.1bn  per  year  to  $4.6bn  per  year.  But  South  Africa  Finance  Minister  Trevor  Manuel  told  the  BBC's  Talking  Point  programme  what  was  needed  was  one  approach,  with  all  wealthy  nations  on  board.  He  said  much  of  the  money  pledged  by  the  US  had  not  yet  been  dispensed.  |||    The  UK  has  made  poverty  in  the  poorest  nations  a  key  theme  for  its  2005  presidency  of  the  Group  of  Eight  (G8),  which  comprises  the  G7  and  Russia.  The  G8  countries  will  meet  at  Gleneagles  in  Scotland.  At  a  dinner  on  Friday  night,  former  South  African  president  Nelson  Mandela  backed  Mr  Brown's  plan  when  he  urged  the  finance  chiefs  to  write-off  African  debt  and  provide  an  extra  $50bn  (£26.69bn)  a  year  in  aid  for  the  next  decade.  Talks  also  centred  on  the  impact  of  the  rising  economies  of  China  and  India,  the  US  budget  and  trade  deficits,  how  the  US,  Europe  and  Japan  can  act  to  boost  global  economic  growth,  and  HIV/Aids.  G7  ministers  called  for  more  flexibility  in  international  exchange  rates  and  said  ""excess  volatility""  would  impede  economic  growth.  Representatives  from  China,  India,  Russia,  South  Africa  and  Brazil  were  invited  to  attend  some  of  the  sessions.  A  G8  summit  is  set  to  take  place  in  July. "

0,"Wembley  firm  won't  make  a  profit  |||    Shares  in  Multiplex  Group,  which  is  building  the  new  Wembley  stadium,  fell  as  much  as  19%  after  it  said  it  would  not  make  any  money  on  the  project.  |||    The  Australian  firm  said  it  would  only  break  even  on  the  1.2bn  Australian  dollars  (£458m;  $874m)  rebuild,  after  a  rise  in  costs  on  the  work.  Any  profits  would  depend  on  the  outcome  of  legal  cases  resulting  from  a  change  in  steel  contractor,  it  added.  It  cut  A$68m  from  profit  targets  for  Wembley  and  another  UK  project.  |||    Investors  were  shaken  by  the  news  and  the  firm's  shares  fell  to  a  four  month  low  of  A$4.50,  before  recovering  to  close  16%  down  at  A$4.67.  The  decline  came  despite  Multiplex  reporting  an  11%  rise  in  pre-tax  profits  to  A$67.7m  for  2004  and  reaffirming  its  2005  profit  forecasts.  Increased  costs  at  Wembley  and  a  separate  development  in  London's  Docklands  saw  Multiplex's  construction  division  report  profits  of  A$35.1m.  |||    The  firm  said  the  result  was  below  expectations  but  stressed  that  the  majority  of  its  UK  projects  -  which  also  include  the  White  City  redevelopment  scheme  in  west  London  -  were  performing  strongly.  |||    To  recoup  any  profit  from  Wembley,  where  the  firm  changed  its  steel  contractor  due  to  a  legal  dispute,  Multiplex  will  have  to  win  legal  claims  against  subcontractors.  These  claims  could  take  up  to  two  years  to  resolve.  ""Multiplex  believes  its  claim  are  sound  and  ultimately  will  exceed  the  level  needed  to  support  the  break  even  position,""  it  said.  ""It  is  expected  that  profits  will  be  possible  in  future  periods  as  the  claims  are  finalised.""  Wembley  Stadium  is  to  due  to  be  completed  in  January  and  will  officially  open  for  the  2006  FA  Cup  Final.  Analysts  expressed  concern  at  the  unexpected  paring  back  in  profit.  ""Such  a  big  writeback  on  the  Wembley  project  in  such  a  short  period  has  impacted  on  management  credibility,""  Simon  Wheatley,  from  Goldman  Sachs,  told  Reuters. "

0,"Insurance  bosses  plead  guilty  |||    Another  three  US  insurance  executives  have  pleaded  guilty  to  fraud  charges  stemming  from  an  ongoing  investigation  into  industry  malpractice.  |||    Two  executives  from  American  International  Group  (AIG)  and  one  from  Marsh  &  McLennan  were  the  latest.  The  investigation  by  New  York  attorney  general  Eliot  Spitzer  has  now  obtained  nine  guilty  pleas.  The  highest  ranking  executive  pleading  guilty  on  Tuesday  was  former  Marsh  senior  vice  president  Joshua  Bewlay.  |||    He  admitted  one  felony  count  of  scheming  to  defraud  and  faces  up  to  four  years  in  prison.  A  Marsh  spokeswoman  said  Mr  Bewlay  was  no  longer  with  the  company.  Mr  Spitzer's  investigation  of  the  US  insurance  industry  looked  at  whether  companies  rigged  bids  and  fixed  prices.  Last  month  Marsh  agreed  to  pay  $850m  (£415m)  to  settle  a  lawsuit  filed  by  Mr  Spitzer,  but  under  the  settlement  it  ""neither  admits  nor  denies  the  allegations"". "

0,"WorldCom  trial  starts  in  New  York  |||    The  trial  of  Bernie  Ebbers,  former  chief  executive  of  bankrupt  US  phone  company  WorldCom,  has  started  in  New  York  with  the  selection  of  the  jury.  |||    Mr  Ebbers,  63,  is  accused  of  being  the  mastermind  behind  an  $11bn  (£6bn)  accounting  fraud  that  eventually  saw  the  firm  collapse  in  July  2002.  His  indictment  includes  charges  of  securities  fraud,  conspiracy  and  filing  false  reports  with  regulators.  If  found  guilty,  Mr  Ebbers  could  face  a  substantial  jail  sentence.  He  has  firmly  declared  his  innocence.  |||    Under  Mr  Ebbers'  leadership,  WorldCom  emerged  from  Mississippi  obscurity  to  become  a  $160bn  telecoms  giant  and  the  darling  of  late  1990s  investors.  Yet  as  competition  intensified  and  the  telecoms  boom  petered  out,  WorldCom  found  itself  under  growing  financial  stress.  When  WorldCom  finally  collapsed,  shareholders  lost  about  $180bn  and  20,000  workers  lost  their  jobs.  Mr  Ebbers'  trial,  which  is  expected  to  last  two  months,  is  the  latest  in  a  series  of  attempts  by  US  prosecutors  to  pursue  senior  executives  for  fraud.  It  will  coincide  with  the  retrial  of  former  Tyco  International  chief  Dennis  Kozlowski  and  his  top  lieutenant,  accused  of  looting  the  industrial  conglomerate  to  the  tune  of  $600m.  Trail  preparations  are  also  preparing  for  former  executives  of  shamed  US  energy  firm  Enron. "

3,"Britain  boosted  by  Holmes  double  |||    Athletics  fans  endured  a  year  of  mixed  emotions  in  2004  as  stunning  victories  went  hand-in-hand  with  disappointing  defeats  and  more  drugs  scandals.  |||    Kelly  Holmes  finally  fulfilled  her  potential  by  storming  to  double  gold  on  the  track  at  the  Olympic  Games.  Holmes  helped  erase  the  gloom  hanging  over  Team  GB  after  their  biggest  medal  hope,  Paula  Radcliffe,  dropped  out  of  the  marathon  and  then  the  10,000m.  Britain's  men's  4x100m  relay  team  also  did  their  bit  by  taking  a  shock  gold.  Holmes  had  started  the  year  in  disappointing  style,  falling  over  in  the  final  of  1500m  at  the  World  Indoor  Championships  where  she  was  favourite.  Her  Olympic  build-up  was  clouded  by  self  doubt  but  that  proved  unfounded  as  she  overhauled  rival  Maria  Mutola  to  win  the  800m  -  her  first  global  title.  Just  five  days  later,  the  34-year-old  made  it  double  gold  in  the  1500m.  It  was  the  first  time  in  84  years  a  Briton  has  achieved  the  Olympic  middle-distance  double.  While  Holmes  left  Athens  as  the  star  of  Team  GB,  it  was  Radcliffe  who  carried  expectations  before  the  August  Games.  |||    The  30-year-old  marathon  world  record  holder  went  into  the  Athens  event  as  favourite  but  an  exhausted  Radcliffe  dropped  out  after  23  miles  in  tears.  Her  decision  to  enter  the  10,000m  five  days  later  also  backfired  as  she  again  pulled  out  with  eight  laps  remaining.  |||    But  Radcliffe  helped  put  her  Olympic  trauma  behind  her  with  a  thrilling  win  in  November's  New  York  Marathon.  The  4x100m  team  grabbed  some  last-gasp  glory  for  the  British  men's  Olympic  squad  after  a  poor  start  to  the  Games.  |||    It  seemed  as  though  Athens  would  be  the  first  Games  where  the  men  would  fail  to  win  a  medal  with  Michael  East  the  only  individual  track  finalist  in  the  1500m.  But  Darren  Campell,  Jason  Gardener,  Marlon  Devonish  and  Mark  Lewis-Francis  made  amends  in  the  sprint  relay.  The  quartet  held  off  favourites  the  USA  to  win  Britain's  first  relay  medal  since  1912  in  38.07  seconds.  Gardener  added  the  Olympic  relay  crown  to  his  World  Indoor  title  over  60m  and,  just  like  Holmes,  finally  lived  up  to  his  promise  in  2004.  Kelly  Sotherton  completed  Team  GB's  athletics  medal  haul  in  Athens  with  a  surprise  bronze  in  the  heptathlon.  The  28-year-old  won  her  first  championship  medal  since  becoming  a  full-time  athlete  in  2003.  |||    But  it  was  a  different  story  for  Britain's  defending  champion  Denise  Lewis,  who  withdrew  on  day  two  of  the  competition  after  some  poor  results.  Lewis,  who  was  troubled  by  injury,  has  ruled  out  retiring  while  Sotherton  is  tipped  to  build  on  her  success.  The  Athens  Olympics  proved  to  be  a  landmark  occasion  for  Steve  Backley,  who  retired  from  competition  after  finishing  fourth  in  the  javelin.  The  battling  35-year-old  leaves  the  sport  with  a  vast  medal  haul  including  two  silvers  and  one  Olympic  bronze.  |||    And  Backley's  departure  was  balanced  by  the  return  of  injury-hit  decathlete  Dean  Macey,  who  came  fourth  in  Athens.  |||    The  continued  improvement  of  sprinter  Abi  Oyepitan  and  long  jumper  Chris  Tomlinson  also  boosted  Team  GB.  Sadly,  the  2004  Olympics  did  not  escape  the  problems  of  drugs  misuse.  On  the  eve  of  the  Games,  Greek  sprinters  Kostas  Kenteris  and  Katerina  Thanou  missed  a  drugs  test  and  claimed  to  have  been  involved  in  a  road  crash.  |||    Kenteris,  the  200m  champion  in  2000,  and  Thanou  have  since  been  charged  by  the  Greek  authorities  and  await  trial.  At  the  Games,  Adrian  Annus  (hammer),  Robert  Fazelas  (discus)  and  Irina  Korzhanenko  (shot)  were  all  stripped  of  their  titles  because  of  doping  issues.  Hungarian  compatriots  Annus  and  Fazelas  both  refused  to  give  urine  samples  while  Russian  Korzhanenko  tested  positive  for  the  steroid  stanozolol.  |||    The  fallout  from  the  THG  scandal,  which  rocked  the  sport  in  2003,  continued  to  impact  in  Olympic  year.  Britain's  4x100m  team  took  gold  without  the  services  of  Dwain  Chambers,  who  was  handed  a  two-year  ban  in  February  after  testing  positive  for  steroid  THG.  |||    American  Kelli  White  was  suspended  and  stripped  of  her  world  100m  and  200m  titles  after  failing  a  drugs  test.  And  world  400m  champion  Jerome  Young  landed  a  life  ban  from  US  chiefs  after  a  second  doping  offence.  Russian  pole  vaulter  Yelena  Isinbayeva  provided  some  light  relief  by  smashing  the  world  record  seven  times  on  her  way  to  the  World  Indoor  and  Olympic  titles.  Her  rivalry  with  compatriot  Svetlana  Feofanova  livened  up  the  field  events.  Morocco's  Hicham  El  Guerrouj  also  delighted  fans  by  racing  to  a  historic  Olympic  double  in  the  1500m  and  5,000m.  |||    And  though  there  was  no  Paula  Radcliffe  in  the  London  Marathon,  there  was  plenty  of  drama  as  Kenyans  Evans  Rutto  and  Margaret  Okayo  took  the  titles.  Rutto  held  on  to  win  despite  slipping  on  some  cobblestones  and  tumbling  into  a  barrier.  Okayo  also  had  to  battle  back  after  mistiming  her  tactics  but  clinched  victory  on  her  debut. "

1,"Tarantino  to  direct  CSI  episode  |||    Film  director  Quentin  Tarantino  is  to  direct  an  episode  of  US  television  series  CSI:  Crime  Scene  Investigation.  |||    The  Oscar-winning  Pulp  Fiction  director  has  also  written  an  original  story  for  the  season  finale  episode.  CSI's  co-producer,  Carol  Mendelsohn,  said  the  episode  would  have  ""more  bugs  and  blood""  than  usual.  It  is  not  Tarantino's  first  venture  into  TV.  In  1995  he  directed  an  episode  of  the  medical  drama  ER  and  has  also  appeared  in  Alias.  |||    Ms  Mendelsohn  said  the  production  team  had  been  trying  for  a  while  to  get  Tarantino  to  direct  an  episode  of  CSI,  and  added  that  he  was  a  fan  of  the  forensic  drama.  She  said  he  finally  agreed  a  few  weeks  ago  while  CSI  was  doing  some  location  shooting  in  Las  Vegas  and  the  show's  stars  persuaded  him.  ""He  knows  everything  there  is  to  know  about  CSI,  and  he  is  into  the  whole  mythology  of  CSI,""  Mendelsohn  said.  ""Quentin  came  in  a  couple  of  weeks  ago.  We  had  a  story  meeting  with  the  writers.  ""He  had  a  great  idea,  and  it  was  so  much  fun  to  have  him  in  the  room...  we  are  positively  giddy.""  Filming  is  due  to  start  in  early  April  and  the  Tarantino-directed  episode  will  be  broadcast  in  the  US  on  19  May. "

0,"US  consumer  confidence  up  |||    Consumers'  confidence  in  the  state  of  the  US  economy  is  at  its  highest  for  five  months  and  they  are  optimistic  about  2005,  an  influential  survey  says.  |||    The  feel-good  factor  among  US  consumers  rose  in  December  for  the  first  time  since  July  according  to  new  data.  The  Conference  Board  survey  of  5,000  households  pointed  to  renewed  optimism  about  job  creation  and  economic  growth.  US  retailers  have  reported  strong  sales  over  the  past  10  days  after  a  slow  start  to  the  crucial  festive  season.  |||    According  to  figures  also  released  on  Tuesday,  sales  in  shopping  malls  in  the  week  to  25  December  were  4.3%  higher  than  in  2003  following  a  last  minute  rush.  Wal-Mart,  the  largest  US  retailer,  has  said  its  December  sales  are  expected  to  be  better  than  previously  forecast  because  of  strong  post-Christmas  sales.  |||    It  is  expecting  annual  sales  growth  of  between  1%  and  3%  for  the  month.  Consumer  confidence  figures  are  considered  a  key  economic  indicator  because  consumer  spending  accounts  for  about  two  thirds  of  all  economic  activity  in  the  United  States.  ""The  continuing  economic  expansion,  combined  with  job  growth,  has  consumers  ending  this  year  on  a  high  note,""  said  Lynn  Franco,  director  of  the  Conference  Board's  consumer  research  centre.  ""And  consumers'  outlook  suggests  that  the  economy  will  continue  to  expand  in  the  first  half  of  next  year.""  The  overall  US  economy  has  performed  strongly  in  recent  months,  prompting  the  Federal  Reserve  to  increase  interest  rates  five  times  since  June. "

0,"Algeria  hit  by  further  gas  riots  |||    Algeria  suffered  a  weekend  of  violent  protests  against  government  plans  to  raise  gas  prices,  local  press  reports.  |||    Demonstrators  in  a  number  of  regions  blocked  roads,  attacked  public  buildings  and  overturned  vehicles,  newspapers  including  El  Watan  reported.  The  price  of  butane  gas,  a  vital  fuel  for  cooking,  has  risen  to  200  dinars  ($2.77)  per  canister  from  170  dinars.  Even  before  the  hike,  failing  economic  conditions  had  been  fanning  resentment  in  some  of  Algeria's  poorest  regions.  |||    Demonstrators  took  to  the  streets  last  week  when  the  cost  change  was  first  announced,  but  police  seemed  to  have  restored  order.  According  to  local  press  reports,  trouble  flared  up  again  on  Saturday  and  carried  on  into  Sunday.  El  Watan  said  that  a  number  of  hot  spots  centred  on  the  villages  and  towns  close  to  Bouira,  about  100  kilometres  (60  miles)  south  of  the  capital  Algiers.  Among  the  other  main  areas  affected  were  the  western  Tiaret  region  and  Sidi  Ammar  in  the  east  of  the  country,  Agence  France  Presse  (AFP)  reported.  Riots  also  flared  up  in  the  Maghnia  region  close  to  the  border  with  Morocco  in  the  west,  AFP  said.  Butane  gas  and  fuel  oil  are  used  as  the  main  source  of  fuel  to  heat  homes  and  cook  food  in  Algeria's  remote  mountain  areas. "

1,"Hitch  holds  on  to  US  box  office  |||    Will  Smith's  first  romantic  comedy,  Hitch,  has  topped  the  North  American  box  office  for  a  second  weekend.  |||    Smith  plays  a  New  York  ""date  doctor""  with  love  worries  of  his  own  in  the  movie,  which  took  $31.8m  (£16.8m).  It  held  off  a  strong  challenge  from  the  new  Keanu  Reeves  sci-fi  thriller  Constantine  which  opened  at  number  two  with  $30.5m  (£16.1m)  Constantine,  based  on  the  Hellblazer  comics,  stars  Reeves  as  an  exorcist  who  must  send  Satan's  minions  back  to  hell.  Two  family  films  came  next  in  the  chart,  with  Wayne  Wang's  comedy  Because  of  Winn-Dixie,  about  a  young  girl  and  an  abandoned  dog,  in  third  position  with  $10.85m  (£5.73m).  |||    Comedy  adventure  Son  of  the  Mask,  came  in  at  number  four  with  $7.7m  (£4.1m),  just  ahead  of  Oscar  favourite  Million  Dollar  Baby  at  five.  |||    Smith's  comedy  will  be  the  first  US  movie  released  this  year  to  top  the  $100m  (£52.7m)  mark.  It's  success  continues  a  strong  trend  of  Hollwood  movie-going  this  year  with  figures  for  the  popular  President's  Day  weekend  13%  greater  than  last  year.  Oscar  contenders  The  Aviator,  starring  Leonardo  DiCaprio  as  Howard  Hughes  and  wine-tasting  comedy  Sideways,  both  held  onto  positions  in  the  top  10. "

0,"Deutsche  Telekom  sees  mobile  gain  |||    German  telecoms  firm  Deutsche  Telekom  saw  strong  fourth  quarter  profits  on  the  back  of  upbeat  US  mobile  earnings  and  better-than-expected  asset  sales.  |||    Net  profit  came  in  at  1.4bn  euros  (£960m;  $1.85bn),  a  dramatic  change  from  the  loss  of  364m  euros  in  2003.  Sales  rose  2.8%  to  14.96bn  euros.  Sales  of  stakes  in  firms  including  Russia's  OAO  Mobile  Telesystems  raised  1.17bn  euros.  This  was  more  than  expected  and  helped  to  bring  debt  down  to  35.8bn  euros.  |||    A  year  ago,  debt  was  more  than  11bn  euros  higher.  T-Mobile  USA,  the  company's  American  mobile  business,  made  a  strong  contribution  to  profits.  ""It's  a  seminal  achievement  that  they  cut  debt  so  low.  That  gives  them  some  head  room  to  invest  in  growth  now,""  said  Hannes  Wittig,  telecoms  analyst  at  Dresdner  Kleinwort  Wasserstein.  The  company  also  said  it  would  resume  paying  a  dividend,  after  two  years  in  which  it  focused  on  cutting  debt. "

1,"Mutant  book  wins  Guardian  prize  |||    A  book  about  the  evolution  of  mutants  and  the  science  of  abnormality  has  won  the  Guardian  First  Book  Award  2004.  |||    Armand  Marie  Leroi,  a  lecturer  at  London's  Imperial  College,  scooped  the  £10,000  prize  for  Mutants:  On  the  form,  varieties  and  errors  of  the  human  body.  ""It  is  profoundly  cultured  and  beautifully  written  in  the  very  best  tradition  of  popular  science  writing  today,""  said  judge  Claire  Armistead.  The  award  recognises  and  rewards  new  writing  across  fiction  and  non-fiction.  A  panel  of  literary  experts,  including  novelists  Hari  Kunzru  and  Ali  Smith,  director  Sir  Richard  Eyre  and  comedian  Alexei  Sayle  chose  the  winner  from  a  five-strong  shortlist.  |||    The  shortlist  included  Susanna  Clarke's  Jonathan  Strange  and  Mr  Norrell,  a  novel  about  the  magic  arts  at  the  turn  of  the  19th  Century  and  The  Places  In  Between,  Rory  Stewart's  account  of  his  trek,  on  foot,  across  Afghanistan.  ""What  we  found  so  impressive  about  Armand  Marie  Leroi's  book  was  the  scope  of  its  reference,  its  elegance  and  its  inquisitiveness,""  said  Ms  Armistead,  chair  of  the  judges  and  the  Guardian  literary  editor.  ""While  the  subject  matter  of  Mutants  unsettled  some  involved  in  the  judging  process,  the  overwhelming  majority  found  it  fascinating,""  she  added.  Her  words  were  echoed  by  Iris  director  Sir  Richard  Eyre  who  called  Marie  Leroi's  work  ""extraordinarily  thought  provoking"".  The  award,  for  first  time  authors,  is  open  to  books  from  genres  including  fiction,  poetry,  biography,  memoir,  history,  politics,  science  and  current  affairs.  Previous  winners  include  White  Teeth  by  Zadie  Smith,  in  2000,  which  went  on  to  become  a  bestseller. "

1,"Singer  Sizzla  jailed  for  swearing  |||    Reggae  star  Sizzla,  whose  UK  tour  was  cancelled  after  protests  at  his  ""anti-gay""  lyrics,  has  been  jailed  in  Jamaica  for  swearing  on  stage.  |||    The  singer  must  serve  15  days  in  prison  after  he  consistently  swore  during  a  concert  in  St  Thomas,  Jamaica,  in  January  despite  warnings  by  police.  He  was  charged  under  a  law  which  prohibits  indecent  dress  or  expression.  Sizzla's  five-date  UK  tour  was  cancelled  last  November  after  protests  by  gay  rights  campaigners.  |||    Sizzla,  whose  real  name  is  Miguel  Collins,  has  released  25  albums  since  1995  and  is  credited  with  taking  dancehall  music  back  to  its  reggae  origins.  Many  Jamaican  entertainers  have  appeared  before  the  courts  for  use  of  profanity  in  recent  years  but  they  usually  receive  a  verbal  warning,  a  suspended  sentence  or  community  service.  Sizzla's  UK  tour  was  cancelled  after  Scotland  Yard's  Racial  and  Violent  Crime  taskforce  announced  it  was  examining  lyrics  by  eight  reggae  artists.  It  would  not  confirm  that  Sizzla  was  among  them.  One  of  his  most  controversial  songs,  Pump  Up,  contains  the  Jamaican  patois  lyrics  ""fire  fi  di  man  dem  weh  go  ride  man  behind"",  translated  by  gay  rights  group  OutRage!  as  ""burn  the  men  who  have  sex  with  men"".

0,"Japanese  mogul  arrested  for  fraud  |||    One  of  Japan's  best-known  businessmen  was  arrested  on  Thursday  on  charges  of  falsifying  shareholder  information  and  selling  shares  based  on  the  false  data.  |||    Yoshiaki  Tsutsumi  was  once  ranked  as  the  world's  richest  man  and  ran  a  business  spanning  hotels,  railways,  construction  and  a  baseball  team.  His  is  the  latest  in  a  series  of  arrests  of  top  executives  in  Japan  over  business  scandals.  He  was  taken  away  in  a  van  outside  one  of  his  Prince  hotels  in  Tokyo.  |||    There  was  a  time  when  Mr  Tsutsumi  seemed  untouchable.  Inheriting  a  large  property  business  from  his  father  in  the  1960s,  he  became  one  of  Japan's  most  powerful  industrialists,  with  close  connections  to  many  of  the  country's  leading  politicians.  He  used  his  wealth  and  influence  to  bring  the  Winter  Olympic  Games  to  Nagano  in  1998.  But  last  year,  he  was  forced  to  resign  from  all  the  posts  he  held  in  his  business  empire,  after  being  accused  of  falsifying  the  share-ownership  structure  of  Seibu  Railways,  one  of  his  companies.  Under  Japanese  stock  market  rules,  no  listed  company  can  be  more  than  80%  owned  by  its  10  largest  shareholders.  Now  Mr  Tsutsumi  faces  criminal  charges  and  the  possibility  of  a  prison  sentence  because  he  made  it  look  as  if  the  10  biggest  shareholders  owned  less  than  this  amount.  Seibu  Railways  has  been  delisted  from  the  stock  exchange,  its  share  value  has  plunged  and  it  is  the  target  of  a  takeover  bid.  |||    Mr  Tsutsumi's  fall  from  grace  follows  the  arrests  of  several  other  top  executives  in  Japan  as  the  authorities  try  to  curb  the  murky  business  practices  which  were  once  widespread  in  Japanese  companies.  His  determination  to  stay  at  the  top  at  all  costs  may  have  had  its  roots  in  his  childhood.  The  illegitimate  third  son  of  a  rich  father,  who  made  his  money  buying  up  property  as  Japan  rebuilt  after  World  War  II,  he  has  described  the  demands  his  father  made.  ""I  felt  enormous  pressure  when  I  dined  with  him  and  it  was  nothing  but  pain,""  Tsutsumi  told  a  weekly  magazine  in  1987.  ""He  scolded  me  for  pouring  too  much  soy  sauce  or  told  me  fruit  was  not  for  children.  He  didn't  let  me  use  the  silk  futon,  saying  it's  a  luxury.""  There  have  been  corporate  governance  issues  at  some  other  Japanese  companies  too.  Last  year,  twelve  managers  from  Mitsubishi  Motors  were  charged  with  covering  up  safety  defects  in  their  vehicles  and  three  executives  from  Japan's  troubled  UFJ  bank  were  charged  with  concealing  the  extent  of  the  bank's  bad  loans.

3,"Beckham  relief  as  Real  go  through  |||    David  Beckham  expressed  his  relief  at  Real  Madrid's  passage  to  the  Champions  League  knockout  phase.  |||    After  Real's  3-0  win  at  Roma,  the  England  skipper  admitted  another  season  of  under-achievement  would  not  be  tolerated  at  the  Bernabeu  stadium.  Beckham  said:  ""It's  expected  of  Madrid  to  get  through,  but  it's  a  relief  for  the  club  and  players  to  have  won.  ""We  lost  momentum  last  season  but  we  cannot  afford  to  to  go  another  season  without  winning  anything.""  Real's  finish  as  runners-up  in  their  Champions  League  group  means  they  cannot  face  his  old  club  Manchester  United  in  the  next  round.  But  Real  could  be  drawn  against  other  Premiership  hopefuls,  Arsenal  or  Chelsea,  who  won  their  respective  groups.  ""It's  going  to  be  great  whoever  we  play,  even  if  we  don't  get  either  of  the  two  English  teams."" "

0,"High  fuel  prices  hit  BA's  profits  |||    British  Airways  has  blamed  high  fuel  prices  for  a  40%  drop  in  profits.  |||    Reporting  its  results  for  the  three  months  to  31  December  2004,  the  airline  made  a  pre-tax  profit  of  £75m  ($141m)  compared  with  £125m  a  year  earlier.  Rod  Eddington,  BA's  chief  executive,  said  the  results  were  ""respectable""  in  a  third  quarter  when  fuel  costs  rose  by  £106m  or  47.3%.  BA's  profits  were  still  better  than  market  expectation  of  £59m,  and  it  expects  a  rise  in  full-year  revenues.  |||    To  help  offset  the  increased  price  of  aviation  fuel,  BA  last  year  introduced  a  fuel  surcharge  for  passengers.  |||    In  October,  it  increased  this  from  £6  to  £10  one-way  for  all  long-haul  flights,  while  the  short-haul  surcharge  was  raised  from  £2.50  to  £4  a  leg.  Yet  aviation  analyst  Mike  Powell  of  Dresdner  Kleinwort  Wasserstein  says  BA's  estimated  annual  surcharge  revenues  -  £160m  -  will  still  be  way  short  of  its  additional  fuel  costs  -  a  predicted  extra  £250m.  Turnover  for  the  quarter  was  up  4.3%  to  £1.97bn,  further  benefiting  from  a  rise  in  cargo  revenue.  Looking  ahead  to  its  full  year  results  to  March  2005,  BA  warned  that  yields  -  average  revenues  per  passenger  -  were  expected  to  decline  as  it  continues  to  lower  prices  in  the  face  of  competition  from  low-cost  carriers.  However,  it  said  sales  would  be  better  than  previously  forecast.  ""For  the  year  to  March  2005,  the  total  revenue  outlook  is  slightly  better  than  previous  guidance  with  a  3%  to  3.5%  improvement  anticipated,""  BA  chairman  Martin  Broughton  said.  BA  had  previously  forecast  a  2%  to  3%  rise  in  full-year  revenue.  |||    It  also  reported  on  Friday  that  passenger  numbers  rose  8.1%  in  January.  Aviation  analyst  Nick  Van  den  Brul  of  BNP  Paribas  described  BA's  latest  quarterly  results  as  ""pretty  modest"".  ""It  is  quite  good  on  the  revenue  side  and  it  shows  the  impact  of  fuel  surcharges  and  a  positive  cargo  development,  however,  operating  margins  down  and  cost  impact  of  fuel  are  very  strong,""  he  said.  Since  the  11  September  2001  attacks  in  the  United  States,  BA  has  cut  13,000  jobs  as  part  of  a  major  cost-cutting  drive.  ""Our  focus  remains  on  reducing  controllable  costs  and  debt  whilst  continuing  to  invest  in  our  products,""  Mr  Eddington  said.  ""For  example,  we  have  taken  delivery  of  six  Airbus  A321  aircraft  and  next  month  we  will  start  further  improvements  to  our  Club  World  flat  beds.""  BA's  shares  closed  up  four  pence  at  274.5  pence. "

1,"Franz  man  seeks  government  help  |||    Franz  Ferdinand  frontman  Alex  Kapranos  has  called  for  more  government  help  for  musicians,  while  taking  part  in  an  Edinburgh  Lectures  discussion.  |||    ""For  any  cultural  output  to  thrive  there  needs  to  be  some  kind  of  state  input  to  that  as  well,""  he  said.  But  Kapranos  warned  against  musicians  being  too  closely  linked  with  MPs,  at  the  University  of  Edinburgh  event.  ""I  think  the  role  of  musicians  is  to  question  politicians  rather  than  to  go  to  bed  with  them,""  he  said.  |||    Kapranos  joined  the  prestigious  lecture  series  to  discuss  Scotland's  role  in  making  21st  Century  music.  ""There  are  elements  of  our  musical  output  which  require  sustenance  because  they  aren't  self-sufficient,""  he  said.  ""But  so-called  commercial  music  would  benefit  from  investment  as  well.""  He  warned  musicians  against  being  allied  to  a  particular  party,  however.  ""I  don't  know  if  having  tea  with  politicians  is  always  a  good  idea.""  |||    Kapranos  and  his  Glasgow  four-piece  band  have  been  nominated  for  five  prizes  at  next  week's  Brit  Awards,  including  best  group  and  best  album.  Their  self-titled  debut  album  won  last  year's  Mercury  Music  Prize  and  spawned  three  top  20  singles.  He  told  the  300-strong  audience  at  the  University's  Reid  Hall  that  musicians  should  listen  to  a  wide  range  of  music  and  should  not  be  restricted  by  stereotypes.  ""We  say  'I  like  this'.  Because  I  listen  to  Nirvana  and  Korn  I  am  a  troubled  individual,  I'm  riddled  with  angst  because  I  listen  to  Chopin  and  Debussy,  I  listen  to  Kylie  Minogue  and  Scissor  Sisters  because  I'm  upbeat  and  I  like  to  party,  I  listen  to  Wagner  because  I  like  the  smell  of  napalm  in  the  morning.""  Kapranos  said  there  was  a  general  ""hostility""  towards  classical  music,  adding:  ""There  is  very  little  done  to  break  that  hostility  other  than  Classic  FM.""  |||    He  concluded:  ""We  define  ourselves  as  a  nation  by  the  way  we  encourage  our  creativity.""  Fellow  speaker  and  classical  composer  James  MacMillan  agreed:  ""We  need  to  rediscover  our  ability  to  listen.""  Previous  speakers  at  the  Edinburgh  Lectures  series  have  included  former  Soviet  leader  Mikhail  Gorbachev  and  author  Professor  Stephen  Hawking.  Kapranos  described  his  appearance  on  Wednesday  as  ""more  daunting  by  a  long  way""  than  their  upcoming  Brits  performance.  ""I  don't  really  care  about  the  Brits,""  he  said.  ""It's  going  to  be  great  to  go  down  but  I  have  actually  had  to  exercise  part  of  my  brain  tonight.""  |||    I  think  the  government  should  do  more  to  help  up-and-coming  artists  be  discovered  by  scrapping  the  entertainment  licences  for  live  venues.  Also  they  should  do  more  to  help  independent  record  labels  have  a  louder  voice  within  an  industry  dominated  by  commercialised  major  labels.  |||    Rather  than  expecting  the  government  -  i.e.  the  taxpayer  -  to  fork  out,  why  don't  some  of  the  megastars  put  something  back  in?  Some  of  Britain's  wealthiest  people  are  musicians  who  have  raked  it  in  from  albums,  concerts  etc.  There  are  far  more  important  demands  on  government  funds.  |||    If  they  can  fund  football,  why  not  fund  music?  |||    Areas  of  the  arts  are  funded  by  government  and  lottery  grants,  so  why  not  music?  We  already  have  the  opera  receiving  huge  grants  and  it  would  clearly  be  beneficial  for  diversity  in  music  to  have  the  same  opportunities  in  other  areas  of  the  music.  The  only  problem  would  be  how  to  judge  what  merits  state  cash.  |||    The  government  has  enough  problems  funding  schools  and  health  services.  If  Alex  Kapranos  genuinely  thinks  a  multi-billion  pound  industry  should  also  have  government  funding  then  his  own  education  was  seriously  lacking  and  more  money  should  be  put  into  that.  |||    As  a  Scot  living  in  England,  I  appreciate  the  value  of  Scottish  music  and  culture  being  a  success,  so  I  can  see  no  problem  with  it!  Franz  Ferdinand,  Travis  and  Snow  Patrol  are  just  recent  examples  of  the  success  Scottish  music  can  have  in  the  world,  so  we  should  do  what  we  Scots  are  good  at  and  support  our  own  goods!  |||    I  think  the  issue  is  more  fundamental:  should  the  government  be  spending  money  on  subsidising  a  multi-million  pound  industry  when  health  and  education  are  in  such  a  sorry  state?  The  answer  is  most  definitely  no.  Those  people  who  are  lucky  enough  to  pursue  their  passion  to  get  their  pay  cheque  shouldn't  be  looking  for  government  subsidies.  I  know  that  if  I  was  lucky  enough  to  be  able  to  pursue  my  dream  of  show  jumping  I  would  want  to  finance  myself  until  I  was  in  a  position  to  pursue  corporate  sponsorship.  |||    Yes  the  government  should  fund  music  -  it  brings  joy  to  the  masses.  |||    There  are  already  thousands  of  state-funded  musicians  out  there  sitting  around,  twiddling  their  thumbs  on  the  ""new  deal"".  Getting  the  government  even  more  involved  would  only  waste  money  that  could  be  put  to  better  use.  |||    As  long  as  the  Government  was  funding  real  talent  it  would  be  a  great  move.  I  would  hate  to  see  more  Pop  Idol-type  funding  of  music  though,  as  it  would  only  serve  to  reinforce  the  stereotypes  that  Alex  talked  about.  |||    Only  if  the  proposals  make  financial  sense.  Franz  Ferdinand  must  be  paying  serious  amounts  of  tax  on  their  record  sales  -  if  they'd  had  a  government  grant  to  get  started  they'd  have  more  than  paid  it  back  by  now,  so  the  Treasury  would  be  making  far  more  than  it  paid  out.  However,  the  government  has  better  things  to  spend  its  money  on  than  to  give  charity  to  everyone  who  decides  they're  a  musician.  The  government  shouldn't  ""fund""  music  -  it  should  ""invest""  in  music  and  those  investments  should  be  treated  like  any  other  investment.  |||    I  think  the  government  needs  to  provide  facilities  and  for  young  groups  and  bands  to  form  and  practise.  The  equipment  is  not  cheap  and  can  be  well  beyond  the  means  of  many  people.  However,  I  do  feel  this  should  be  the  extent  of  their  role,  to  provide  the  conditions  for  the  talent  to  flourish  and  let  it  go  from  there.  |||    I  do  agree  that  the  government  should  help  to  fund  music  but  there  is  also  a  responsibility  held  by  record  companies!  They  generally  always  opt  for  the  tried  and  tested  and  tend  not  to  want  to  break  any  moulds  or  risk  losing  any  money  which  ultimately,  the  directors  are  in  the  business  for!  If  labels  were  more  willing  to  put  money  forward  towards  smaller  breakthrough  acts  then  the  government  wouldn't  have  to  fork  out  a  great  deal.  |||    Yeah,  why  not?  Music  should  be  government  funded,  particularly  the  work  of  modern  composers  and  veteran  bands/artists  and  stuff.  Pop  music  pretty  much  rules  the  earth,  so  more  attention  should  go  to  the  other  fraternities  |||    I  agree  with  funding  the  arts  to  make  it  more  accessible  to  the  public  but  I  am  not  convinced  that  pop  music  requires  financial  support  from  the  taxpayer.  There  is  a  great  deal  of  money  generated  through  pop  music  -  perhaps  a  tax  on  pop  could  be  ploughed  into  the  public  performance  of  other  forms  of  music  for  everyone  to  enjoy.  Perhaps  we  could  financially  penalise  really  bad  Pop  Idol-style  music  -  that  is,  the  music  industry  sector  without  any  artistic  merit  or  originality  whatsoever  and  that  which  is  specifically  designed  to  line  the  pockets  of  music  producers.  Call  it  a  tax  on  music  ""pollution"",  if  you  like.  |||    Though  I  really  like  Franz  Ferdinand,  I  have  to  disagree  with  Mr  Kapranos.  Once  government  gets  their  hand  into  the  private  sector,  it  will  destroy  the  creative  and  possibly  controversial  avenues  the  artist  pursues.  Many  years  ago,  this  was  the  case  with  the  US  NEA,  when  the  government  started  to  question  what  was  considered  art  for  the  money  they  were  allotting.  The  solution  Mr  Kapranos  should  pursue  would  be  privately-funded  organizations,  like  Save  the  Music  in  the  US. "

0,"Liberian  economy  starts  to  grow  |||    The  Liberian  economy  started  to  grow  in  2004,  but  ""sustained  and  deep  reform  efforts""  are  needed  to  ensure  long  term  growth,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  has  said.  |||    An  IMF  mission  made  the  comments  in  a  report  published  following  10  days  of  talks  with  the  transition  government.  The  IMF  said  that,  according  to  data  provided  by  the  Liberians,  the  country's  GDP  rose  by  2%  in  2004,  after  a  31%  decline  in  2003.  Liberia  is  recovering  from  a  14-year  civil  war  that  came  to  an  end  in  2003.  The  power-sharing  National  Transition  Government  of  Liberia  will  remain  in  place  until  elections  on  11  October,  the  first  presidential  and  parliamentary  ballots  since  the  conflict  ended.  |||    The  IMF  said  Liberia's  economy  started  to  grow  last  year  thanks  to  a  ""continued  strong  recovery  in  rubber  production,  domestic  manufacturing  and  local  services  including  post-conflict  reconstruction"".  The  IMF  however  remains  cautious  about  what  it  sees  as  a  lack  of  transparency  in  government  actions.  In  particular,  it  pointed  to  mystery  surrounding  the  sale  of  iron  ore  stockpiles  and  the  alleged  disappearance  of  some  import  and  export  permits.  These  matters  are  now  being  investigated  by  the  Liberian  authorities  and  the  IMF  has  called  for  their  findings  to  be  made  public.  The  IMF  also  said  it  was  crucial  that  the  Central  Bank  of  Liberia  be  strengthened,  the  national  budget  be  effectively  managed  and  a  sound  economic  basis  built  to  allow  the  country's  large  external  debt  to  be  addressed.  ""The  IMF  team  stands  ready  to  assist  the  (Liberian)  authorities  in  strengthening  the  areas  mentioned,""  said  the  report.  ""The  team  agreed  with  the  (Liberian)  authorities  that  the  period  until  elections  and  the  inauguration  of  a  new  government  will  pose  exceptional  challenges  to  fiscal  management,  and  expresses  its  willingness  to  provide...continued  support.""

1,"Chris  Evans  back  on  the  market  |||    Broadcaster  Chris  Evans  has  begun  selling  thousands  of  his  possessions  from  a  stall  in  Camden  Market,  London.  |||    Evans  perched  on  a  stool  as  shoppers  wandered  around  the  open-fronted  shop  packed  with  his  furniture.  Among  the  items  from  his  homes  in  Los  Angeles  and  London  were  countless  sofas,  chairs,  pictures,  beds  and  memorabilia  from  his  past  TV  shows.  Asked  the  reason  for  the  sale,  Evans  said:  ""I  just  want  to  get  rid  of  it  all,  it's  just  a  headache.""  He  added:  ""It  feels  good  to  be  selling  this  stuff,  it's  a  weight  off  my  mind.  ""Look  at  it  all,  there's  so  much  clutter.  I've  enjoyed  every  bit  of  furniture  and  every  poster  but  it's  not  important  anymore.""  The  normally  gregarious  Evans  cut  a  peculiarly  unshowbusiness-like  figure  as  he  sipped  coffee  and  smoked  cigarettes,  wrapped  in  a  big  coat  and  scarf  in  front  of  his  Aladdin's  cave.  |||    However,  the  ostentation  of  some  of  the  items  on  sale  painted  a  picture  of  the  eccentricity  that  endeared  him  to  the  British  public  in  shows  such  as  Channel  4's  gameshow  Don't  Forget  Your  Toothbrush.  The  most  striking  thing  about  many  of  the  pieces  was  their  sheer  size.  Sofas  looked  like  they  could  seat  a  small  party  and  a  bed  seemed  big  enough  for  four.  The  elaborate  nature  of  the  pieces,  many  custom-made,  had  to  be  admired,  particularly  a  huge  red  and  gold  upholstered  ""throne""  and  a  stripy  deckchair  from  the  Queen  Mary  liner.  |||    To  help  people  in  their  browsing,  Evans  had  given  the  pieces  labels  with  not  only  the  price  but  a  helpful,  often  comic,  aside.  ""Isn't  it  great""  was  the  comment  on  the  £1,950  throne  and  ""Bob  Dylan's  old  sofa  -  honest""  was  written  on  a  dark  wood  couch  priced  £4,250.  |||    The  prices  were  steep  by  a  lot  of  people's  standards  but  Evans  said  it  was  not  deterring  shoppers.  ""I've  sold  quite  a  lot  already.  Everything  here  is  on  sale  for  less  than  I  bought  it  for  but  it's  not  really  about  the  money.  It's  about  getting  rid  of  it  all.  We've  all  been  bartering,  that's  what  it's  all  about.""  He  added  that  he  was  not  going  to  reveal  what  he  was  going  to  do  with  the  money  he  was  making.  Vintage  TV  and  film  posters  also  lined  the  walls,  including  a  rare  portrait  of  Raquel  Welch  and  an  original  advertising  print  from  the  Benny  Hill  Show.  And,  almost  hidden  at  the  back  of  the  lock-up,  were  the  two  giant  toothbrushes  from  his  former  Channel  4  show,  although  these  were  not  for  sale.  |||    Despite  the  sheer  curiosity  value  of  the  sale,  there  was  a  healthy  trickle  of  interest  from  the  public  rather  than  the  perhaps  expected  crowds.  Some  wandered  in  just  to  browse,  as  they  would  any  of  the  other  stalls,  not  knowing  that  it  belonged  to  Evans.  |||    Paul  Burgess  said:  ""I  didn't  realise.  I  thought  it  was  just  a  load  of  junk.  I  should  go  back  and  have  a  better  look.""  But  local  resident  Francesca  Detakats  came  specially  to  the  stall  and  left  happy  with  her  purchase  of  an  original  1960s  photograph  of  The  Who  by  David  Wedgburg.  Ms  Detakats  said  she  was  a  collector  and  did  not  mind  paying  £350  for  the  print.  ""If  you  like  something,  you  don't  really  count  it  like  that,""  she  said.  |||    Martin  Hellewell,  who  had  also  made  a  point  of  visiting  Evans'  shop,  said  he  thought  it  was  a  great  idea.  ""Why  not,  if  you've  got  stuff  to  get  rid  of  it's  a  good  place  to  do  it,""  said  Mr  Hellewell.  Evans  has  taken  out  the  stall  with  business  partner  Pete  Winterbottom.  They  plan  to  open  every  day  if  possible,  although  Evans  did  not  know  how  often  he  would  be  there.  ""We'll  stay  definitely  until  Christmas  and  then  maybe  a  week  after  that,""  said  Evans. "

0,"Asian  quake  hits  European  shares  |||    Shares  in  Europe's  leading  reinsurers  and  travel  firms  have  fallen  as  the  scale  of  the  damage  wrought  by  tsunamis  across  south  Asia  has  become  apparent.  |||    More  than  23,000  people  have  been  killed  following  a  massive  underwater  earthquake  and  many  of  the  worst  hit  areas  are  popular  tourist  destinations.  Reisurance  firms  such  as  Swiss  Re  and  Munich  Re  lost  value  as  investors  worried  about  rebuilding  costs.  But  the  disaster  has  little  impact  on  stock  markets  in  the  US  and  Asia.  |||    Currencies  including  the  Thai  baht  and  Indonesian  rupiah  weakened  as  analysts  warned  that  economic  growth  may  slow.  ""It  came  at  the  worst  possible  time,""  said  Hans  Goetti,  a  Singapore-based  fund  manager.  ""The  impact  on  the  tourist  industry  is  pretty  devastating,  especially  in  Thailand.""  Travel-related  shares  dropped  in  Europe,  with  companies  such  as  Germany's  TUI  and  Lufthansa  and  France's  Club  Mediterranne  sliding.  Insurers  and  reinsurance  firms  were  also  under  pressure  in  Europe.  |||    Shares  in  Munich  Re  and  Swiss  Re  -  the  world's  two  biggest  reinsurers  -  both  fell  1.7%  as  the  market  speculated  about  the  cost  of  rebuilding  in  Asia.  Zurich  Financial,  Allianz  and  Axa  also  suffered  a  decline  in  value.  |||    However,  their  losses  were  much  smaller,  reflecting  the  market's  view  that  reinsurers  were  likely  to  pick  up  the  bulk  of  the  costs.  Worries  about  the  size  of  insurance  liabilities  dragged  European  shares  down,  although  the  impact  was  exacerbated  by  light  post-Christmas  trading.  Germany's  benchmark  Dax  index  closed  the  day  16.29  points  lower  at  3.817.69  while  France's  Cac  index  of  leading  shares  fell  5.07  points  to  3.817.69.  Investors  pointed  out,  however,  that  declines  probably  would  be  industry  specific,  with  the  travel  and  insurance  firms  hit  hardest.  ""It's  still  too  early  for  concrete  damage  figures,""  Swiss  Re's  spokesman  Floiran  Woest  told  Associated  Press.  ""That  also  has  to  do  with  the  fact  that  the  damage  is  very  widely  spread  geographically.""  |||    The  unfolding  scale  of  the  disaster  in  south  Asia  had  little  immediate  impact  on  US  shares,  however.  The  Dow  Jones  index  had  risen  20.54  points,  or  0.2%,  to  10,847.66  by  late  morning  as  analsyts  were  cheered  by  more  encouraging  reports  from  retailers  about  post-Christmas  sales.  In  Asian  markets,  adjustments  were  made  quickly  to  account  for  lower  earnings  and  the  cost  of  repairs.  Thai  Airways  shed  almost  4%.  The  country  relies  on  tourism  for  about  6%  of  its  total  economy.  Singapore  Airlines  dropped  2.6%.  About  5%  of  Singapore's  annual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  comes  from  tourism.  Malaysia's  budget  airline,  AirAsia  fell  2.9%.  Resort  operator  Tanco  Holdings  slumped  5%.  |||    Travel  companies  also  took  a  hit,  with  Japan's  Kinki  Nippon  sliding  1.5%  and  HIS  dropping  3.3%.  However,  the  overall  impact  on  Asia's  largest  stock  market,  Japan's  Nikkei,  was  slight.  Shares  fell  just  0.03%.  Concerns  about  the  strength  of  economic  growth  going  forward  weighed  on  the  currency  markets.  The  Indonesian  rupiah  lost  as  much  as  0.6%  against  the  US  dollar,  before  bouncing  back  slightly  to  trade  at  9,300.  The  Thai  baht  lost  0.3%  against  the  US  currency,  trading  at  39.10.  In  India,  where  more  than  2,000  people  are  thought  to  have  died,  the  rupee  shed  0.1%  against  the  dollar  Analysts  said  that  it  was  difficult  to  predict  the  total  cost  of  the  disaster  and  warned  that  share  prices  and  currencies  would  come  under  increasing  pressure  as  the  bills  mounted.

2,"Hague  'given  up'  his  PM  ambition  |||    Former  Conservative  leader  William  Hague  says  he  will  not  stand  for  the  leadership  again,  having  given  up  his  ambition  to  be  prime  minister.  |||    Mr  Hague,  43,  told  the  Daily  Telegraph  he  would  now  find  a  life  dominated  by  politics  too  ""boring""  and  unfulfilling.  Mr  Hague,  who  stepped  down  after  his  party's  2001  election  defeat,  does  not  rule  out  a  return  to  the  front  bench.  He  also  told  the  paper  he  hopes  to  remain  MP  for  Richmond,  North  Yorks,  and  start  a  family  with  wife  Ffion.  Mr  Hague,  who  recently  had  published  the  biography  of  William  Pitt  the  Younger,  also  said  he  wanted  to  continue  writing  books  and  speech-writing.  |||    He  told  the  newspaper:  ""I  don't  know  whether  I  will  ever  go  back  on  to  the  front,  but  don't  rush  me.""  Asked  if  he  would  stand  for  the  leadership  again,  Mr  Hague  replied:  ""No.  Definitely  not.""  His  determination  to  stay  away  from  a  central  role  will  disappoint  some  senior  Conservative  members,  who  say  the  party  needs  him.  Tim  Collins,  the  shadow  education  secretary,  said  last  week  it  would  be  a  ""huge  boost""  to  the  party  if  Mr  Hague  returned  to  the  front  bench.  Mr  Hague  became  an  MP  at  27  and  Leader  of  the  Opposition  at  36.  He  said:  ""I  feel  fortunate  that,  by  the  age  of  40,  I  had  crammed  in  an  entire  political  career.  ""I  had  been  in  the  Cabinet  and  been  leader  of  the  party,  so  now  I  can  branch  out  into  other  things...it  is  a  very  liberating  feeling.""  Mr  Hague  added  that  he  may  have  misjudged  his  own  ambition  to  be  prime  minister.  ""Maybe  I  wasn't  as  driven  by  politics  as  I  thought  I  was,""  he  said. "

2,"Lawyer  attacks  anti-terror  laws  |||    A  senior  barrister  who  has  resigned  in  protest  over  the  government's  anti-terror  laws  says  the  current  system  is  giving  Britain  a  bad  name.  |||    Ian  MacDonald  QC  quit  when  the  government  failed  to  recognise  a  House  of  Lords  ruling  that  detaining  terror  suspects  indefinitely  is  unlawful.  He  was  part  of  a  19-strong  panel  who  have  special  security  clearance  to  act  for  suspected  terrorists.  Five  more  barristers  are  now  reported  to  be  threatening  to  resign.  |||    Mr  MacDonald  told  BBC  News:  ""The  reason  why  I  am  resigning  is  because  I  fundamentally  disagree  with  locking  people  up  without  any  trial  for  an  indefinite  period  on  reasonable  suspicion.  ""The  current  legal  system  is  certainly  having  a  very  adverse  effect  on  the  Muslim  community  in  Britain  and  the  whole  Asian  community.  ""I  think  it  is  giving  Britain  a  bad  name  internationally"".  |||    Under  the  Anti-Terrorism,  Crime  and  Security  Act  introduced  by  the  government  in  2001  in  response  to  the  11  September  attacks,  foreign  nationals  suspected  of  involvement  in  terrorism  who  cannot  be  deported  can  be  held  indefinitely  without  trial.  But  Mr  MacDonald  believes  that  detainees  currently  being  held  should  be  entitled  to  a  trial  by  jury.  ""My  own  view  is  we  need  to  have  a  full  return  to  trial  by  jury,  a  proper  criminal  trial  with  proper  accusations.  ""As  far  as  I'm  concerned,  the  government  have  to  start  all  over  again  and  rethink  their  whole  strategy  for  dealing  with  this.""  he  added.  |||    The  Attorney  General  Lord  Goldsmith  will  receive  a  letter  of  resignation  from  Mr  MacDonald  on  Monday.  According  to  the  Independent,  his  resignation  is  expected  to  be  followed  by  those  of  five  other  barristers  -  Nicholas  Blake  QC,  Andrew  Nicol  QC,  Manjit  Singh  Gill  QC,  Rick  Scannell  and  Tom  de  la  Mare.  They  are  all  believed  to  be  carefully  considering  their  positions  on  the  panel  of  Special  Advocates  who  represent  detainees  before  the  Special  Immigration  Appeals  Commission  (SIAC)  -  a  secure  court  without  a  jury,  which  tries  terror  suspects.  Mr  MacDonald  said  he  had  ""no  idea""  whether  further  resignations  would  follow.  But  Barry  Hugill,  a  spokesman  for  the  campaign  group  Liberty,  told  Radio  4's  Today  programme  that  more  lawyers  may  go.  ""I  can  assure  that  there  is  a  distinct  possibilty  that  more  lawyers  may  be  resigning,""  he  said.  ""They  are  now  in  a  situation  where  everything  they  have  been  trained  to  believe  in,  the  right  to  trial  by  jury,  has  been  abandoned  and  that  is  what  gives  some  of  them  sleepless  nights.""  |||    Helena  Kennedy,  a  Labour  peer  and  a  human  rights  lawyer,  said  the  Special  Advocates'  main  concern  was  that  once  they  had  seen  any  special  intelligence  they  were  not  allowed  to  speak  to  the  detainees.  ""When  this  whole  procedure  was  being  considered  immediately  after  11  September  there  was  a  great  deal  of  argument  particularly  in  the  House  of  Lords  about  whether  there  really  was  a  process  that  could  be  considered  a  judicial  review,""  she  said.  ""Without  that  you  are  having  detention  with  no  habeus  corpus  and  really  a  blot,  as  Ian  McDonald  has  said,  on  our  legal  landscape,  something  really  quite  shocking  with  regard  to  the  rule  of  the  law."" "

2,"Lib  Dems'  'bold'  election  policy  |||    Charles  Kennedy  has  told  voters  his  Liberal  Democrats  will  offer  them  an  ""honest  choice""  at  the  next  general  election.  |||    With  the  other  two  big  parties  battling  over  which  will  impose  the  lowest  taxes,  Mr  Kennedy  is  going  into  the  looming  election  pledged  to  increase  taxation.  It  is  a  bold  policy  and  certainly  ensures  there  is  that  choice  between  the  Lib  Dems  and  the  other  two.  With  his  party's  previous  pledge  to  increase  taxes  by  one  penny  in  the  pound  to  spend  on  public  services  already  adopted  by  the  government,  he  has  switched  tack.  Now  he  is  promising  to  levy  a  ""modest""  increase  of  the  same  amount  on  earnings  over  £100,000  a  year  to  allow  him  to  finance  a  series  of  pledges.  They  are  to  scrap  student  fees,  finance  free  long  term  care  for  the  elderly  and  replace  the  council  tax  with  a  local  income  tax.  That  last  policy  will  also  see  about  3%  of  the  most  well  off  paying  more  while  others,  pensioners  in  particular,  will  pay  less.  |||    Labour  and  the  Tories  have  attacked  his  policies  as  both  unworkable  and  not  properly  costed.  |||    Inevitably  they  insist  there  is  no  need  to  raise  taxes  to  fund  improvements  in  services.  The  Tories  claim  they  can  improve  services  AND  cut  taxes  through  £35bn  efficiency  savings,  while  Labour  has  offered  £22bn  savings  but  has  yet  to  map  out  precise  tax  proposals,  although  there  is  little  chance  they  will  propose  increases.  In  many  ways  the  argument  between  the  Lib  Dems  and  the  others  over  taxation  and  spending  echo  the  sort  of  arguments  that  raged  between  Labour  and  the  Tories  in  the  1980s  and  early  1990s.  But,  unlike  the  old  Tory-Labour  debate,  he  believes  voters  are  ready  to  see  ""modest""  tax  increases  on  the  well  off  in  order  to  fund  improvements  in  services.  That  is  a  view  partly  endorsed  by  recent  polls  suggesting  people  would  rather  have  cash  spent  on  public  services  than  tax  cuts.  |||    Similarly  there  is  a  different  tone  to  the  Lib  Dem  approach  to  asylum  and  immigration,  with  Mr  Kennedy  stressing  politicians  should  not  ""foment  an  artificial  debate""  about  immigration  and  attacking  Michael  Howard's  proposals  for  quotas.  Once  again,  with  the  two  other  big  parties  singing  similar  songs  on  immigration,  Mr  Kennedy  is  stressing  the  different,  more  liberal  approach  of  his  party.  Mr  Kennedy  was  also  in  buoyant  mood  over  his  party's  election  chances,  declaring  the  Tories  were  not  going  to  be  ""significant  players""  in  the  poll.  He  repeated  his  pledge  not  to  do  post-election  deals  with  either  party  after  the  election.  Mr  Kennedy  went  on  to  suggest  the  re-election  of  a  Labour  government  with  a  small  majority  would  amount  to  a  ""massive  vote  of  no  confidence  ""  in  Tony  Blair's  government.  That  suggests  the  Lib  Dem  leader  believes  he  may  well  find  himself  in  a  powerful,  even  pivotal  position  in  a  vastly  different  House  of  Commons  after  the  next  election.  It  is  a  dream  the  third  party  has  dreamed  many  times  before. "

2,"Blair  congratulates  Bush  on  win  |||    Tony  Blair  has  said  he  looks  forward  to  continuing  his  strong  relationship  with  George  Bush  and  working  with  him  during  his  second  term  as  president.  |||    Mr  Bush's  re-election  came  at  a  crucial  time  for  a  world  that  was  ""fractured,  divided  and  uncertain"",  Mr  Blair  said.  It  had  to  be  brought  together,  he  added,  saying  action  was  needed  on  poverty,  the  Middle  East  and  the  conditions  on  which  terrorists  prey.  Mr  Blair  said  states  had  to  work  with  the  US  to  fight  global  terrorism.  |||    But  there  was  a  need  to  recognise  it  would  not  be  defeated  by  ""military  might  alone  but  also  by  demonstrating  the  strength  of  our  common  values""  he  added.  Solving  the  conflict  in  the  Middle  East  was  the  world's  single  most  ""pressing  political  challenge""  of  the  present  day,  Mr  Blair  warned.  The  prime  minister  also  urged  Europe  and  the  US  to  ""build  anew  their  alliance"".  |||    ""All  of  us  in  positions  of  leadership,  not  just  President  Bush,  have  a  responsibility  to  rise  to  this  challenge.  It  is  urgent  that  we  do  so.""  Mr  Blair  also  paid  tribute  to  Democrat  John  Kerry's  campaign,  saying  he  had  helped  make  the  presidential  election  ""a  true  celebration  of  American  democracy"".  The  election  of  the  US  president  was  significant  for  the  world  but  particularly  so  for  Britain  because  of  its  special  relationship,  he  added.  Earlier  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  sent  Mr  Bush  his  ""warmest  congratulations"",  saying:  ""We  look  to  the  president  to  be  a  unifying  force  for  those  all  over  the  world  who  share  our  determination  to  defend  freedom.""  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  welcomed  the  fact  there  had  been  a  quick  conclusion  to  the  election,  unlike  in  2000.  |||    Mr  Bush's  first  task  was  to  ""rebuild  a  sense  of  domestic  purpose""  within  the  US,  he  said.  Mr  Kennedy  said:  ""Internationally,  it  is  to  be  hoped  that  a  second  term  will  see  a  more  sensitive  approach  to  relations  with  long-standing  allies,  not  least  for  the  global  efforts  to  combat  terrorism.""  Lib  Dem  foreign  affairs  spokesman  Menzies  Campbell  said  a  win  by  Mr  Kerry  would  have  given  Mr  Blair  the  chance  of  a  fresh  start,  adding  it  was  almost  as  if  there  was  an  ""umbilical  cord""  between  Mr  Bush  and  the  UK  premier.  |||    ""Europeans  must  hope  that  his  administration  will  be  much  more  multilateral  in  character,  and  that  he  will  act  swiftly  to  rebuild  the  Atlantic  partnership  which  is  so  vital  to  security.  ""Iraq  will  remain  an  issue  of  potential  division  for  some  time  to  come.""  Even  before  the  result  became  clear,  Mr  Blair  was  being  urged  to  push  for  action  on  climate  change  at  his  first  meeting  with  whichever  candidate  won.  |||    Liberal  Democrat  environment  spokesman  Norman  Baker  underlined  the  issue  of  global  warming  during  a  Commons  debate  on  Anglo-American  relations  on  Wednesday.  Environment  Secretary  Margaret  Beckett  has  said  the  US  will  act  on  global  warming  despite  George  Bush's  refusal  to  sign  up  to  the  Kyoto  protocol  on  carbon  emissions.  Public  opinion  would  force  change,  she  told  BBC  news.  But  Myron  Ebell,  an  adviser  on  climate  change  to  President  Bush,  has  said  there  would  be  no  change  in  the  US  stance  and  rejected  the  threat  of  climate  change.  He  claimed  the  US  was  the  only  country  with  independent  scientists. "

0,"Consumers  drive  French  economy  |||    France's  economic  growth  accelerated  in  the  last  three  months  of  2004,  driven  by  consumer  spending,  a  report  shows.  |||    Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  rose  by  0.8%  in  the  fourth  quarter  compared  with  the  previous  three  month  period,  the  statistical  office  INSEE  said.  That  expansion  pushed  annual  growth  to  2.3%,  the  fastest  rate  in  two  years.  Consumer  spending  was  up  by  1.2%  in  the  fourth  quarter,  and  there  also  was  a  rebound  in  business  investment  that  gave  the  recovery  an  extra  shove.  |||    Analysts  warned  that  France  still  was  facing  challenges  and  was  unlikely  to  keep  expanding  at  its  current  pace.  |||    ""France  still  has  a  strong  economic  growth,""  said  Marc  Toutai,  an  economist  at  Natexis  Banques  Populaires.  ""But,  if  we  check  the  figures  in  detail,  there's  a  problem.""  ""Consumer  spending  is  still  high.  But  French  households  have  spent  their  savings  to  consume.  ""France  can't  sustain  a  high  growth  rate  without  an  improvement  in  the  job  market.  There's  too  much  of  a  gap  between  growth  and  employment.""  Unemployment  levels  are  currently  stuck  at  about  10%,  and  is  proving  difficult  to  bring  down  despite  government  efforts.  Another  worry  is  that  demand  in  Germany  and  Italy,  two  of  France's  main  trading  partners,  is  sluggish.  |||    Despite  the  concerns,  analysts  pointed  out  that  France  was  outperforming  the  majority  of  its  European  counterparts  and  that  its  economy  was  looking  more  robust  than  in  previous  years.  As  well  as  strong  domestic  demand,  exports  climbed  by  1.3%  in  the  fourth  quarter  -  the  biggest  increase  in  foreign  sales  for  a  year.  ""It's  an  economic  growth  that  seems  well  balanced,""  said  Nicolas  Claquin,  an  analyst  at  CCF.  ""In  the  beginning  of  2004,  growth  was  mainly  driven  by  consumer  spending.  Here  it  gets  contributions  from  investment  and  exports,  though  household  consumption  is  still  strong.  ""But  we  expect  overall  economic  growth  to  fall  to  2.0  percent  in  2005."" "

0,"Irish  duo  could  block  Man  Utd  bid  |||    Irishmen  JP  McManus  and  John  Magnier,  who  own  a  29%  stake  in  Manchester  United,  will  reportedly  reject  any  formal  £800m  offer  for  the  club.  |||    The  Sunday  Times  and  The  Sunday  Telegraph  say  they  will  oppose  any  formal  £800m  takeover  bid  from  US  tycoon  Malcom  Glazer.  Mr  Glazer  got  permission  to  look  at  the  club's  accounts  last  week.  Irish  billionaires  Mr  McManus  and  Mr  Magnier  are  said  to  believe  that  an  £800m  bid  undervalues  club  prospects.  |||    Mr  Magnier  and  Mr  McManus,  who  hold  their  stake  through  their  Cubic  Expression  investment  vehicle  have  the  power  to  block  a  bid.  Mr  Glazer's  financial  backers,  including  JP  Morgan,  the  US  investment  bank  have  said  they  won't  back  a  bid  unless  it  receives  backing  from  the  owners  of  at  least  75%  of  the  club's  shares.  However,  there  has  been  much  speculation  that  the  Irish  duo  simply  do  not  think  the  price  offered  -  300p  a  share  -  is  high  enough.  Mr  Glazer  has  been  stalking  the  premier  league  football  club  since  2003.  |||    Mr  Magnier  and  Mr  McManus  issued  a  statement  late  on  Friday  saying  that  they  remained  ""long-term  investors""  in  Man  Utd.  The  Sunday  Telegraph  says  the  board  of  Manchester  United  also  considered  a  management  buyout  at  just  over  300p  but  did  not  go  ahead  with  it. "

2,"'No  more  concessions'  on  terror  |||    Charles  Clarke  says  he  has  ""no  desire""  to  offer  more  concessions  on  his  controversial  anti-terror  plans  to  get  them  on  to  the  statute  book.  |||    MPs  voted  in  favour  of  the  Prevention  of  Terrorism  Bill  after  Mr  Clarke  agreed  to  key  changes  -  but  Labour's  majority  was  reduced  to  14.  The  Bill  now  faces  opposition  from  peers  angry  at  house  arrest  proposals.  Lord  Strathclyde,  Tory  leader  in  the  Lords,  said  ministers  should  expect  it  to  be  ""substantially  re-written"".  |||    The  Bill  proposes  ""control  orders"",  which  as  well  as  house  arrest  could  impose  curfews,  tagging  or  bans  on  telephone  and  internet  use.  They  would  replace  current  powers  to  detain  foreign  terror  suspects  without  trial,  which  the  law  lords  have  ruled  against.  |||    On  Monday,  MPs  voted  272-219  in  favour  of  the  Bill  after  key  concessions  from  Mr  Clarke.  The  government  earlier  saw  its  161-strong  majority  cut  to  just  14  as  a  cross-party  amendment  was  narrowly  rejected  by  the  Commons  despite  the  support  of  62  Labour  rebels.  Mr  Clarke  won  over  critics  by  announcing  he  would  introduce  an  amendment  in  the  Lords  to  ensure  the  most  controversial  control  order,  amounting  to  house  arrest,  would  be  imposed  by  judges  and  not  politicians.  Lord  Strathclyde  warned  ministers  that  they  should  ""prepare  themselves  for  substantial  rewriting  of  various  aspects  of  the  Bill"".  ""They  should  consider  far  more  seriously  the  use  of  intercept  evidence  in  any  trial  and  I  think  they  should  drop  the  most  objectionable  proposals,  which  are  for  house  arrest.""  |||    But  Mr  Clarke  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme  he  believed  the  changes  he  had  made  to  the  Bill  to  win  over  critics  in  the  Commons  should  be  sufficient  to  satisfy  colleagues  in  the  Lords.  ""No  Bill  goes  through  Parliament  without  detailed  consideration  being  made,  but  I  believe  that  what  I  announced  yesterday  will  be  sufficient  to  secure  the  agreement  of  the  House  of  Lords,""  he  said.  |||    ""I  have  no  desire  to  make  further  so-called  concessions  on  the  Bill.""  Mr  Clarke's  proposed  amendment  will  be  debated  by  the  Lords  on  Tuesday  without  having  been  considered  by  MPs.  The  debate  is  unlikely  to  result  in  a  vote.  Speaking  after  the  Commons  debate,  shadow  home  secretary  David  Davies  said  the  bill  had  been  ""clearly  very  badly  drawn-up""  and  that  the  government  was  trying  to  rush  it  through  too  quickly.  He  said  it  would  be  possible  to  ""rescue""  the  government  and  make  the  law  ""tolerable""  by  amending  it  in  the  Lords.  ""The  scope  for  miscarriages  of  justice  is  enormous,""  he  told  BBC  News.  |||    Mark  Oaten,  for  the  Liberal  Democrats,  said  Monday  night's  vote  showed  the  government  had  ""lost  the  confidence  of  all  sides  of  the  House"".  He  said:  ""They  need  to  rethink  the  bill,  and  extend  the  power  of  a  judge  to  decide  on  all  control  orders,  build  safeguards  on  evidence  and  create  charges  against  suspects.  ""Unless  there  is  a  major  movement,  this  bill  is  doomed  to  fail.""  |||    BBC  News  political  editor  Andrew  Marr  said:  ""I  think  that  this  is  a  bill  in  deep  trouble.  It's  been  unravelling  in  the  House  of  Commons  -  it  may  unravel  further.""  The  government  wants  the  new  bill  to  pass  into  law  by  14  March,  when  the  current  powers  expire.

3,"Yelling  takes  Cardiff  hat-trick  |||    European  cross-country  champion  Hayley  Yelling  completed  a  hat-trick  of  wins  in  the  Reebok  Cardiff  Cross  Challenge  in  Bute  Park  on  Sunday  afternoon.  |||    The  part-time  maths  teacher  beat  Irish  international  Jolene  Byrne  by  40  metres  in  the  six-kilometre  race.  Another  Great  Britain  international,  Louise  Damen,  finished  third  as  part  of  the  contingent  representing  England.  Peter  Riley,  who  secured  bronze  for  the  GB  men's  team  at  last  month's  European  Championships,  won  the  men's  9km  race.  Riley,  representing  England,  moved  away  over  the  last  two  kilometres  to  win  by  25  metres  from  Ireland's  Gary  Murray.  Glynn  Tromans  -  the  reigning  UK  Inter-Countries  and  England  Cross-Country  champion  -  came  in  third  place  as  he  continues  his  comeback  from  a  five-month  injury  lay-off. "

2,"Kilroy  unveils  immigration  policy  |||    Ex-chatshow  host  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  has  attacked  UK  policy  on  immigration  saying  Britain's  open  door  approach  is  hitting  low  wage  ""indigenous""  workers.  |||    The  Veritas  leader  said  the  only  people  to  benefit  from  immigrants  from  places  like  Poland  were  employers,  landlords,  members  of  the  'metropolitan  elite'.  The  MEP  said  his  party  would  only  admit  foreigners  who  were  required  because  they  had  specific  skills  to  offer.  And  he  argued  asylum  cost  £2bn  a  year  for  14,000  successful  applicants.  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk  said  that  worked  out  at  £143,000  per  successful  asylum  seeker.  He  said  Veritas  wanted  to  grant  an  amnesty  for  all  those  in  Britain  claiming  asylum  and  who  have  children  and  deport  everyone  else.  Britain  should  take  its  fair  share  of  asylum  seekers  under  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  Human  Rights,  he  argued.  And  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  said  he  wanted  to  spend  an  extra  £500m  a  year  to  help  provide  for  refugees  abroad. "

0,"Crossrail  link  'to  get  go-ahead'  |||    The  £10bn  Crossrail  transport  plan,  backed  by  business  groups,  is  to  get  the  go-ahead  this  month,  according  to  The  Mail  on  Sunday.  |||    It  says  the  UK  Treasury  has  allocated  £7.5bn  ($13.99bn)  for  the  project  and  that  talks  with  business  groups  on  raising  the  rest  will  begin  shortly.  The  much  delayed  Crossrail  Link  Bill  would  provide  for  a  fast  cross-London  rail  link.  The  paper  says  it  will  go  before  the  House  of  Commons  on  23  February.  |||    A  second  reading  could  follow  on  16  or  17  March.  ""We've  always  said  we  are  going  to  introduce  a  hybrid  Bill  for  Crossrail  in  the  Spring  and  this  remains  the  case,""  the  Department  for  Transport  said  on  Sunday.  Jeremy  de  Souza,  a  spokesman  for  Crossrail,  said  on  Sunday  he  could  not  confirm  whether  the  Treasury  was  planning  to  invest  £7.5bn  or  when  the  bill  would  go  before  Parliament.  |||    However,  he  said  some  impetus  may  have  been  provided  by  the  proximity  of  an  election.  |||    The  new  line  would  go  out  as  far  as  Maidenhead,  Berkshire,  to  the  west  of  London,  and  link  Heathrow  to  Canary  Wharf  via  the  City.  Heathrow  to  the  City  would  take  40  minutes,  dramatically  cutting  journey  times  for  business  travellers,  and  reducing  overcrowding  on  the  tube.  The  line  has  the  support  of  the  Mayor  of  London,  Ken  Livingstone,  business  groups  and  the  government,  but  there  have  been  three  years  of  arguments  over  how  it  should  be  funded.  The  Mail  on  Sunday's  Financial  Mail  said  the  £7.5bn  of  Treasury  money  was  earmarked  for  spending  in  £2.5bn  instalments  in  2010,  2011  and  2012. "

2,"Butler  launches  attack  on  Blair  |||    Former  civil  service  chief  Lord  Butler  has  criticised  the  way  Tony  Blair's  government  operates,  accusing  it  of  being  obsessed  with  headlines.  |||    He  also  attacked  the  way  the  Iraq  war  was  ""sold""  to  the  public,  with  important  warnings  on  the  strength  of  the  intelligence  left  out.  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  said  Lord  Butler  had  given  the  ""most  damaging  testimony""  he  could  remember.  But  Downing  Street  said  Mr  Blair  should  be  judged  by  results  not  his  style.  |||    Lord  Butler  said  Mr  Blair  bypassed  the  Cabinet  and  relied  instead  on  small,  informal  groups  of  advisers  to  help  him  make  decisions.  The  prime  minister's  official  spokesman  said  the  Cabinet  was  still  used  to  achieve  a  consensus  on  important  issues.  But  he  added:  ""You  cannot,  in  a  modern  government,  take  every  decision  in  Cabinet.  It's  just  not  possible.""  |||    Lord  Butler  said  the  government  had  too  much  freedom  to  ""bring  in  bad  Bills""  and  ""to  do  whatever  it  likes""  and  it  relied  too  much  on  the  advice  of  political  appointees.  The  former  cabinet  secretary  said  in  an  interview  with  The  Spectator  magazine:  ""I  would  be  critical  of  the  present  government  in  that  there  is  too  much  emphasis  on  selling,  there  is  too  much  central  control  and  there  is  too  little  of  what  I  would  describe  as  reasoned  deliberation  which  brings  in  all  the  arguments.""  Mr  Howard  described  Lord  Butler's  intervention  as  ""very  important"".  ""This  is  from  someone  who  was  an  insider  at  the  very  heart  of  the  Blair  government.  ""It  is  certainly  the  most  damaging  testimony  I  can  ever  remember  from  someone  in  such  an  eminent  position.""  |||    Lord  Butler's  report  earlier  this  year  into  Iraq  intelligence  said  the  government's  September  2002  weapons  dossier  did  not  make  clear  intelligence  about  claims  that  Saddam  Hussein  had  stockpiles  of  chemical  and  biological  weapons  was  ""very  thin"".  The  reason  for  this  is  that  it  would  have  weakened  ministers'  case  for  war,  Lord  Butler  said  in  his  Spectator  interview,  which  was  conducted  by  the  magazine's  editor,  Conservative  MP  Boris  Johnson.  He  said:  ""When  civil  servants  give  material  to  ministers,  they  say  these  are  the  conclusions  we've  drawn,  but  we've  got  to  tell  you  the  evidence  we've  got  is  pretty  thin.  ""Similarly,  if  you  are  giving  something  to  the  United  Nations  and  the  country  you  should  warn  them.""  |||    Asked  why  he  thought  the  warnings  were  not  there  Lord  Butler  said:  ""One  has  got  to  remember  what  the  purpose  of  the  dossier  was.  The  purpose  of  the  dossier  was  to  persuade  the  British  why  the  government  thought  Iraq  was  a  very  serious  threat.""  |||    When  asked  whether  he  thought  the  country  was  well-governed  on  the  whole,  he  replied:  ""Well.  I  think  we  are  a  country  where  we  suffer  very  badly  from  Parliament  not  having  sufficient  control  over  the  executive,  and  that  is  a  very  grave  flaw.  ""We  should  be  breaking  away  from  the  party  whip.  The  executive  is  much  too  free  to  bring  in  a  huge  number  of  extremely  bad  Bills,  a  huge  amount  of  regulation  and  to  do  whatever  it  likes  -  and  whatever  it  likes  is  what  will  get  the  best  headlines  tomorrow.  ""All  that  is  part  of  what  is  bad  government  in  this  country.""  Lord  Butler's  assessment  was  backed  by  his  predecessor  as  Cabinet  Secretary,  Lord  Armstrong.  Lord  Armstrong  told  BBC  Two's  Newsnight:  ""I  agree  ...  there  doesn't  appear  to  be  the  sort  of  informed  collective  political  judgement  brought  to  bear  on  decision-making  that  those  affected  by  decisions  are  entitled  to  expect.""  Liberal  Democrat  deputy  leader  Menzies  Campbell  said  he  thought  Lord  Butler's  comments  were  ""well  justified""  and  Mr  Blair's  style  of  leadership  was  ""corrosive  of  the  whole  system  of  government"".  But  Labour  former  minister  Jack  Cunningham  accused  Lord  Butler  of  basing  his  comments  on  the  first  eight  months  of  the  incoming  Labour  administration,  when  he  was  cabinet  secretary.  Mr  Cunningham  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""Taken  together,  Robin  Butler's  comments  are  partial,  inaccurate  and  cannot  be  taken  as  anything  other  than  politically  biased  against  the  Labour  government.""

0,"Chinese  exports  rise  25%  in  2004  |||    Exports  from  China  leapt  during  2004  over  the  previous  year  as  the  country  continued  to  show  breakneck  growth.  |||    The  spurt  put  China's  trade  surplus  -  a  sore  point  with  some  of  its  trading  partners  -  at  a  six-year  high.  It  may  also  increase  pressure  on  China  to  relax  the  peg  joining  its  currency,  the  yuan,  with  the  weakening  dollar.  The  figures  released  by  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  come  as  China's  tax  chief  confirmed  that  growth  had  topped  9%  in  2004  for  the  second  year  in  a  row.  State  Administration  of  Taxation  head  Xie  Xuren  said  a  tightening  of  controls  on  tax  evasion  had  combined  with  the  rapid  expansion  to  produce  a  25.7%  rise  in  tax  revenues  to  2.572  trillion  yuan  ($311bn;  £165bn).  |||    According  to  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  China's  exports  totalled  $63.8bn  in  December,  taking  the  annual  total  up  35.4%  to  $593.4bn.  With  imports  rising  a  similar  amount,  the  deficit  rose  to  $43.4bn.  The  increased  tax  take  comes  despite  healthy  tax  rebates  for  many  exporters  totalling  420bn  yuan  in  2004,  according  to  Mr  Xie.  China's  exporting  success  has  made  the  trade  deficit  of  the  United  States  soar  even  further  and  made  trade  with  China  a  sensitive  political  issue  in  Washington.  The  peg  keeping  the  yuan  around  8.30  to  the  dollar  is  often  blamed  by  US  lawmakers  for  job  losses  at  home.  A  US  report  issued  on  Tuesday  on  behalf  of  a  Congressionally-mandated  panel  said  almost  1.5  million  posts  disappeared  between  1989  and  2003.  The  pace  accelerated  in  the  final  three  years  of  the  period,  said  the  report  for  the  US-China  Economic  and  Security  Review  Commission,  moving  out  of  labour-intensive  industries  and  into  more  hi-tech  sectors.  The  US's  overall  trade  deficit  with  China  was  $124bn  in  2003,  and  is  expected  to  rise  to  about  $150bn  for  2004. "

2,"Labour  battle  plan  'hides  Blair'  |||    The  Tories  have  accused  Tony  Blair  of  being  ""terrified""  of  scrutiny  after  Labour  unveiled  details  of  how  it  will  fight  the  next  general  election.  |||    In  a  break  with  tradition,  the  party  will  ditch  the  leader's  battle  bus  and  daily  press  briefings  in  Westminster.  Instead  Mr  Blair  will  travel  to  key  cities  and  marginal  seats  to  deliver  the  party's  message.  Labour  election  chief  Alan  Milburn  denied  the  party  was  trying  to  ""hide""  the  prime  minister.  |||    He  promised  ""the  most  positive  and  upbeat  election  campaign  Labour  has  ever  run"".  But  Tory  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  said  Labour's  plans  showed  Mr  Blair  was  ""terrified  of  facing  proper  scrutiny"".  |||    ""At  a  time  when  the  British  people  are  looking  for  more  accountability  and  openness,  this  government  turns  its  back  on  them;  abandoning  plans  to  tour  the  country  and  scared  to  face  journalists  in  a  press  conference  -  it  does  rather  beg  the  question,  'What  have  they  got  to  hide?'""  The  general  election  is  widely  expected  next  May  and  all  the  parties  are  stepping  up  their  campaign  preparations.  Mr  Milburn  said  the  economy  would  take  centre  stage  in  Labour's  campaign  in  what  would  be  a  ""watershed""  election  and  the  ""last  stand  of  the  Thatcherites"".  Mr  Milburn  said  Labour's  slogan  would  be  ""Britain  is  working  -  Don't  let  the  Tories  wreck  it.""  |||    The  tone  of  the  campaign,  said  Mr  Milburn,  would  be  more  conversational  than  rhetorical;  more  spontaneous  less  scripted;  less  national  more  local  and  less  based  on  issues  and  more  concentrated  on  people.  The  approach  is  particularly  designed  to  appeal  to  women  voters,  he  said.  Mr  Milburn  brushed  aside  questions  over  why  the  chancellor  was  not  present  at  the  Cabinet  meeting  to  discuss  election  strategy  particularly  since  such  importance  was  being  given  to  the  economy.  ""I'm  not  privy  to  everybody's  diary,""  he  said.  Mr  Brown  has  headed  Labour's  preparations  for  previous  polls  but  Mr  Milburn  is  taking  that  role  this  time.  In  a  break  with  the  past,  Labour  will  not  hold  a  daily  news  conference  in  London.  It  will  not  be  a  ""battle  bus""  style  campaign  either,  he  said.  |||    In  previous  elections,  each  party  leader  has  had  their  own  battle  bus  transporting  national  newspaper,  television  and  radio  reporters  to  staged  campaign  events  around  the  country.  Mr  Milburn  said  Labour's  media  effort  this  time  would  focus  more  on  local  newspapers  and  broadcasters,  with  every  local  radio  station  given  the  chance  to  interview  the  prime  minister.  Mr  Milburn  said  there  would  also  be  a  greater  effort  to  set  up  face-to-face  meetings  between  ministers  and  the  electorate.  Former  Downing  Street  media  chief  Alastair  Campbell  is  also  returning  to  advise  Labour  on  media  strategy  and  campaigning.  |||    Mr  Milburn  said  no  decision  had  been  taken  yet  over  whether  David  Blunkett  would  have  a  prominent  role  in  the  election.  Liberal  Democrat  chief  executive  Lord  Rennard  suggested  Labour  was  avoiding  news  conferences  in  London  because  it  wanted  less  scrutiny  of  its  record  and  proposals.  ""Tony  Blair  seems  to  have  disappeared  from  Labour  leaflets  and  broadcasts,""  he  said.  ""In  contrast  Charles  Kennedy  will  feature  prominently  in  the  Liberal  Democrat  campaign  right  across  the  country."" "

1,"Low-budget  film  wins  Cesar  |||    A  film  that  follows  a  group  of  alienated  youth  in  a  Paris  suburb  as  they  prepare  to  perform  an  18th  Century  play  has  won  France's  top  cinema  award.  |||    L'Esquive  earned  a  Cesar  prize  for  its  director,  Tunisian-born  Abdellatif  Kechiche,  and  its  young  star,  the  18-year-old  actress  Sara  Forestier.  It  saw  off  competition  from  big-budget  French  epic,  A  Very  Long  Engagement,  and  the  box-office  hit,  The  Chorus.  US  film  Lost  in  Translation  won  the  award  for  best  foreign  feature.  The  wistful  romantic  comedy  directed  by  Sofia  Coppola  has  already  won  several  awards,  including  an  Oscar  for  best  screenplay  in  2004.  Its  late  release  in  France  made  it  a  contender  for  this  year's  Cesars.  |||    The  low-budget  L'Esquive  depicts  the  travails  of  a  group  of  youth  getting  ready  to  perform  a  school  play  by  the  18th-Century  dramatist,  Marivaux.  The  actors  are  mostly  amateurs  and  the  action  is  set  in  the  impoverished  suburbs  of  Paris,  home  to  thousands  of  immigrants  from  North  Africa  and  their  children.  Kechiche  said  he  made  the  film  because  he  ""wanted  to  show  people  we  don't  normally  see  at  the  cinema"".  A  Very  Long  Engagement,  a  World  War  I  drama  featuring  Audrey  Tautou,  won  five  Cesar  awards.  The  Chorus,  a  film  about  a  schoolteacher  who  introduces  an  unruly  classroom  to  the  pleasures  of  classical  singing,  won  two  awards  -  for  best  music  and  best  sound.  US  actor  Will  Smith,  who  won  an  honorary  award  at  the  ceremony,  thanked  his  family  and  his  ""hero"",  Nelson  Mandela,  in  his  speech. "

0,"Google  shares  fall  as  staff  sell  |||    Shares  in  Google  have  fallen  6.7%  after  employees  and  early  investors  in  the  web  search  took  advantage  of  the  first  chance  to  sell  their  holdings.  |||    Restrictions  were  imposed  ahead  of  its  flotation  in  August,  to  prevent  shares  being  dumped  quickly  onto  the  market.  In  one  of  the  most  closely-watched  initial  public  offerings  in  stock  market  history,  the  US-based  company  sold  19.6  million  shares  at  $85  each.  Google  shares  have  risen  since  but  fell  $12.33  on  Tuesday  to  close  at  $172.55.  The  restriction  -  known  as  a  lockup  -  is  being  eased  piecemeal:  in  all,  some  227  million  additional  shares  will  become  free  to  trade  by  February  2005.  Selling  the  shares  could  turn  many  of  Google's  workers  into  millionaires.  |||    There  were  fears  that  the  potential  increase  of  shares  in  circulation  from  Tuesday  would  ease  demand  for  stock.  However,  analysts  say  they  expected  most  shareholders  would  be  holding  back  from  selling  all  their  shares  immediately,  as  Google's  good  performance  and  future  growth  potential  means  demand  will  hold.  |||    In  its  first  earnings  report  since  floating  on  the  stock  market,  Google  said  it  made  a  net  profit  of  $52m  in  the  three  months  ending  30  September.  Sales  surged  to  $805.9m  in  the  third  quarter,  up  from  $393.9m  a  year  earlier.  Google's  main  service  -  its  internet  search  -  is  free  to  users,  so  the  firm  makes  much  of  its  money  from  selling  advertising  space  linked  to  the  words  for  which  its  users  search.  It  also  sells  the  use  of  its  technology  to  companies  who  need  to  make  either  their  websites,  or  their  internal  information  systems,  searchable. "

0,"'Strong  dollar'  call  halts  slide  |||    The  US  dollar's  slide  against  the  euro  and  yen  has  halted  after  US  Treasury  Secretary  John  Snow  said  a  strong  dollar  was  ""in  America's  interest"".  |||    But  analysts  said  any  gains  are  likely  to  be  short-lived  as  problems  with  the  US  economy  were  still  significant.  They  also  pointed  out  that  positive  comments  apart,  President  George  W  Bush's  administration  had  done  little  to  stop  the  dollar's  slide.  A  weak  dollar  helps  boost  exports  and  narrow  the  current  account  deficit.  The  dollar  was  trading  at  $1.2944  against  the  euro  at  2100GMT,  still  close  to  the  $1.3006  record  level  set  on  10  November.  Against  the  Japanese  yen,  it  was  trading  at  105.28  yen,  after  hitting  a  seven-month  low  of  105.17  earlier  in  the  day.  |||    Policy  makers  in  Europe  have  called  the  dollar's  slide  ""brutal""  and  have  blamed  the  strength  of  the  euro  for  dampening  economic  growth.  However,  it  is  unclear  whether  ministers  would  issue  a  declaration  aimed  at  curbing  the  euro's  rise  at  a  monthly  meeting  of  Eurozone  ministers  late  on  Monday.  Higher  growth  in  Europe  is  regarded  by  US  officials  as  a  way  the  huge  US  current  account  deficit  -  that  has  been  weighing  on  the  dollar  -  could  be  reduced.  Mr  Snow  who  is  currently  in  Dublin  at  the  start  of  a  four-nation  EU  visit,  has  applauded  Ireland's  introduction  of  lower  taxes  and  deregulation  which  have  helped  boost  growth.  ""The  eurozone  is  growing  below  its  potential.  When  a  major  part  of  the  global  economy  is  below  potential  there  are  negative  consequences...  for  the  citizens  of  those  economies...  and  for  their  trading  partners,""  he  said.  Mr  Snow's  comments  may  have  helped  shore  up  the  dollar  on  Monday,  but  he  was  careful  to  qualify  his  statement.  |||    ""Our  basic  policy,  of  course,  is  to  let  open,  competitive  markets  set  the  values,""  he  explained.  ""Markets  are  driven  by  fundamentals  and  towards  fundamentals.""  US  officials  have  also  said  that  other  economies  need  to  grow,  so  the  US  is  not  the  main  global  growth  engine.  Economists  say  that  the  fundamentals,  or  key  indicators,  of  the  US  economy  are  looking  far  from  rosy.  Domestic  consumer  demand  is  cooling,  and  heavy  spending  by  President  Bush  has  pushed  the  budget  deficit  to  a  record  $427bn  (£230bn).  The  current  account  deficit,  meanwhile,  hit  a  record  $166bn  in  the  second  quarter  of  2004.  For  many  analysts,  a  weaker  dollar  is  here  to  stay.  ""No  end  is  in  sight,""  said  Carsten  Fritsch,  a  strategist  at  Commerzbank  .  ""It  is  only  a  matter  of  time  until  the  euro  reaches  $1.30.""  Some  analysts  maintain  the  US  is  secretly  happy  with  a  lower  dollar  which  helps  makes  its  exports  cheaper  in  Europe,  thus  boosting  its  economy. "

2,"Parties  build  up  poll  war  chests  |||    The  Labour  Party  received  more  than  £5m  in  donations  in  the  final  quarter  of  2004,  new  figures  show.  |||    This  is  nearly  half  of  the  £11,724,929  received  by  16  political  parties  listed  by  the  Electoral  Commission.  The  Conservatives  were  in  second  place  with  donations  totalling  £4,610,849,  while  the  Liberal  Democrats  received  just  over  £1m.  The  majority  of  Labour's  donations  came  from  affiliated  trade  unions.  There  were  also  large  sums  from  individuals.  Lord  Drayson,  whose  company  PowderJect  won  multi-million  pound  contracts  to  provide  smallpox  vaccine  to  the  government  after  the  11  September  terror  attacks,  gave  £500,000  to  the  party  just  days  before  Christmas.  |||    This  followed  an  earlier  donation  of  the  same  amount  earlier  in  2004.  He  was  made  a  lord  by  Tony  Blair  last  year.  Other  significant  donations  came  from  retired  millionaire  businessman  and  philanthropist  Sir  Christopher  Ondaatje  who  gave  the  party  a  sum  of  £500,000,  and  refrigerator  magnate  William  Haughey  OBE  who  gave  £330,000.  The  totals  for  the  fourth  quarter  were  well  up  on  the  same  period  of  2003,  as  the  parties  built  up  their  war  chests  for  the  general  election  campaign.  The  largest  donation  to  the  Conservatives  was  a  bequest  from  Ruth  Beardmore  of  nearly  £400,000.  The  joint  founder  of  merchant  bank  Hambro  Magan  gave  £325,417.  There  were  also  donations  topping  £250,000  for  the  Conservatives  from  Scottish  Business  Groups  Focus  on  Scotland  and  the  Institute  of  International  Research,  the  world's  largest  independent  conference  company.  |||    Also  among  the  gifts  to  the  Tories  were  24  donations  totalling  £161,840  from  Bearwood  Corporate  Services.  This  company  is  controlled  by  the  party's  former  treasurer  Lord  Ashcroft  which  has  directed  almost  £300,000  to  specific  marginal  constituencies  over  the  past  two  years.  The  Liberal  Democrats'  largest  donor  was  the  Joseph  Rowntree  Reform  Trust  Ltd,  a  company  which  promotes  political  reform  and  constitutional  change,  which  gave  a  sum  of  £250,000.  And  fast  food  giants  McDonald's  are  listed  as  donating  a  sum  of  £10,575.  This  was  a  fee  the  firm  paid  for  a  room  for  an  event  held  with  the  work  and  skills  foundation  during  the  party's  conference.  The  UK  Independence  Party,  which  lost  its  main  donor  Paul  Sykes  amid  the  row  over  Robert  Kilroy-Silk's  bid  for  the  leadership  last  autumn,  took  in  £63,081.  Just  £8,170  of  this  was  cash  and  the  remainder  came  in  gifts  in  kind,  such  as  office  space  and  printing.  Registered  political  parties  are  required  to  set  out  each  quarter  all  donations  over  £5,000  to  their  headquarters  and  over  £1,000  to  local  constituency  parties  they  receive.  It  is  an  offence  for  a  person  to  knowingly  or  recklessly  make  a  false  declaration  about  party  donations. "

1,"Singer  Ferguson  'facing  eviction'  |||    Three  Degrees  star  Sheila  Ferguson  is  the  favourite  to  be  evicted  from  ITV's  I'm  A  Celebrity...  Get  Me  Out  Of  Here  on  Monday.  |||    Bookmakers  Ladbrokes  says  the  singer  has  even  odds  of  being  the  first  contestant  to  be  voted  off  the  show.  ""It's  going  to  be  close  but  Sheila  is  favourite  as  she  has  shown  herself  to  be  a  bit  of  a  troublemaker,""  said  Ladbrokes'  Warren  Lush.  Comic  Joe  Pasquale  remains  odds  on  favourite  to  win  the  reality  show.  Mr  Lush  added  that  Nancy  Sorrell's  chances  of  an  early  departure  had  increased  since  the  surprise  arrival  of  husband  Vic  Reeves  in  the  jungle  camp  last  Wednesday.  Notwithstanding,  comedian  Reeves  remains  3/1  favourite  to  win  the  show,  after  Pasquale.  |||    Huggy  Bear  actor  Antonio  Fargas  also  remains  a  contender  for  eviction  having  ""done  nothing  to  live  up  to  the  pre-show  hype"".  ""There  has  been  a  big  gamble  on  Natalie  [Appleton]  to  go...  but  bookies  fancy  the  millions  at  home  will  keep  piling  on  the  misery  by  putting  her  through  more  bushtucker  trials,""  added  Mr  Lush.  The  former  All  Saint  star  has  performed  dismally  in  bushtucker  trials  which  have  seen  her  plunged  into  glass  tanks  containing  putrid  waste  and  challenged  to  eat  fish  eyes.  On  Friday,  Ladbrokes  suspended  betting  after  singer  Brian  Harvey  quit  the  show  folllowing  a  blazing  row  with  Janet  Street-Porter.  Harvey,  who  entered  the  camp  a  day  later  than  other  contestants  after  learning  that  his  grandmother  had  died,  reached  the  end  of  his  tether  following  days  of  meagre  rations  and  rows.

2,"Goldsmith:  'I  was  not  leant  on'  |||    The  attorney  general  has  again  denied  being  ""leant  on""  by  Downing  Street  to  make  the  legal  case  for  invading  Iraq.  |||    Claims  a  written  answer  on  the  legality  of  the  war  was  drafted  by  Downing  Street  were  ""wholly  unfounded,""  he  insisted  during  stormy  Lords  exchanges.  Lord  Goldsmith  said  the  answer  represented  his  ""genuinely  held  independent  view""  the  war  was  legal.  The  text  was  released  on  the  eve  of  a  crucial  Commons  vote  in  which  MPs  backed  the  invasion  of  Iraq.  Many  Labour  MPs  have  since  indicated  that  the  attorney  general's  answer  played  a  pivotal  role  in  their  willingness  to  back  the  conflict.  The  government  has  resisted  calls  to  publish  the  full  advice,  saying  such  papers  are  always  kept  confidential.  In  the  House  of  Lords,  the  attorney  general  faced  a  call  by  former  Tory  lord  chancellor  Lord  Mackay  to  now  publish  the  ""full  text""  of  the  advice  -  the  suggestion  was  rejected.  Another  peer  meanwhile,  Lord  Skidelsky,  said  not  to  publish  the  full  legal  opinion  would  ""strengthen  the  suspicion  that  the  the  original  text  was  doctored  for  public  consumption,  in  exactly  the  same  way  as  the  notorious  intelligence  dossier  on  weapons  of  mass  destruction"".  |||    Last  week  Lord  Goldsmith  said  in  a  statement:  ""I  was  fully  involved  throughout  the  drafting  process  and  personally  finalised,  and  of  course  approved,  the  answer.""  He  said  the  answer  had  been  prepared  in  his  office  with  the  involvement  of  Solicitor  General  Harriet  Harman,  two  of  his  own  officials,  three  Foreign  Office  officials,  a  QC,  Christopher  Greenwood  and  the  then  Lord  Chancellor,  Lord  Irvine  of  Lairg.  ""No  other  minister  or  official  was  involved  in  any  way.""  ""As  I  have  always  made  clear,  I  set  out  in  the  answer  my  own  genuinely  held,  independent  view  that  military  action  was  lawful  under  the  existing  (UN)  Security  Council  resolutions,""  he  said.  ""The  answer  did  not  purport  to  be  a  summary  of  my  confidential  legal  advice  to  government.""  Former  foreign  secretary  Robin  Cook  said  Lord  Goldsmith's  admission  that  his  parliamentary  answer  was  not  a  summary  of  his  legal  opinion  suggested  Parliament  may  have  been  misled.  ""The  attorney  general  may  never  have  presented  his  answer  as  a  summary,  but  others  certainly  did,""  he  said.  ""What  is  clear  from  his  statement  today  is  that  he  does  not  believe  that  it  was  a  full,  accurate  summary  of  his  formal  opinion.""  |||    Tony  Blair  has  dismissed  questions  about  the  attorney  general's  advice,  and  said  his  Parliamentary  statement  had  been  a  ""fair  summary""  of  his  opinion.  ""That's  what  he  [Lord  Goldsmith]  said  and  that's  what  I  say.  He  has  dealt  with  this  time  and  time  and  time  again,""  Mr  Blair  told  his  monthly  news  conference  in  Downing  Street.  He  refused  to  answer  further  questions  on  the  issue.  On  the  question  of  whether  such  papers  have  always  been  kept  confidential,  Tory  MP  Michael  Mates,  who  is  a  member  of  the  Commons  intelligence  and  security  committee  and  was  part  of  the  Butler  inquiry,  told  the  BBC:  ""That,  as  a  general  rule,  is  right,  but  it's  not  an  absolute  rule.""  He  said  there  had  been  other  occasions  when  advice  had  been  published,  most  recently  regarding  Prince  Charles's  marriage  plans.  The  government  could  not  pick  and  choose  when  to  use  the  convention,  he  said.  Mr  Mates  added:  ""This  may  be  one  of  those  special  occasions...  when  it  would  be  in  the  public  interest  to  see  the  advice  which  the  attorney  general  gave  to  the  prime  minister.""  A  book  published  by  Philippe  Sands  QC,  a  member  of  Cherie  Blair's  Matrix  Chambers  says  Lord  Goldsmith  warned  Tony  Blair  on  7  March  2003  that  the  Iraq  war  could  be  illegal  without  a  second  UN  resolution  sanctioning  military  action.  A  short  statement  about  Lord  Goldsmith's  position  presented  in  a  written  parliamentary  answer  on  17  March  2003  -  just  before  a  crucial  Commons  vote  on  the  military  action  -  did  not  suggest  this.

0,"Troubled  Marsh  under  SEC  scrutiny  |||    The  US  stock  market  regulator  is  investigating  troubled  insurance  broker  Marsh  &  McLennan's  shareholder  transactions,  the  firm  has  said.  |||    The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  has  asked  for  information  about  transactions  involving  holders  of  5%  or  more  of  the  firm's  shares.  Marsh  has  said  it  is  co-operating  fully  with  the  SEC  investigation.  Marsh  is  also  the  focus  of  an  inquiry  the  New  York  attorney-general  into  whether  insurers  rigged  the  market.  Since  that  inquiry  was  launched  in  October,  Marsh  has  replaced  its  chief  executive  and  held  a  boardroom  shake-out  to  meet  criticism  by  lessening  the  number  of  company  executives  on  the  board.  Prosecutors  allege  that  Marsh  -  the  world's  biggest  insurance  broker  -  and  other  US  insurance  firms  may  have  fixed  bids  for  corporate  cover.  This  is  the  issue  at  the  heart  of  the  inquiry  by  New  York's  top  law  officer,  Eliot  Spitzer,  and  a  separate  prosecution  of  five  insurers  by  the  State  of  California.  The  SEC's  investigation  into  so-called  related  party  transactions  includes  dealings  in  the  Trident  Funds,  managed  by  MMC  Capital,  the  company's  private  equity  firm.  Marsh's  new  chief  executive,  Michael  Cherkasky,  is  trying  to  negotiate  a  settlement  with  Mr  Spitzer.  Mr  Spitzer  has  built  up  a  reputation  as  a  fierce  critic  and  campaigner  against  corporate  America's  misdeeds.  |||    The  uncertainty  unleashed  by  the  scandal  has  prompted  three  credit  rating  agencies  -  Standard  &  Poor's,  Moody's  and  Fitch  -  to  downgrade  Marsh  in  recent  weeks.  According  to  the  Financial  Times,  insurance  analysts  are  now  questioning  whether  Marsh  will  be  able  to  maintain  its  strong  record  of  earning  growth  as  they  draw  up  forecasts  for  the  first  quarter  of  next  year.  Doubts  also  exist  over  how  much  the  company  may  have  to  pay  regulators  and  lawyers  to  put  the  scandal  behind. "

Hanks  will  play  Robert  Langdon,  who  is  trying  to  solve  the  murder  of  a  member  of  an  ancient  society  that  has  protected  dark  secrets  for  centuries.  It  will  be  Hanks'  third  collaboration  with  Howard.  They  previously  worked  together,  along  with  Howard's  producing  partner  Brian  Grazer,  on  Splash  and  Apollo  13.  |||    Hanks  is  one  of  Hollywood's  most  bankable  stars,  with  his  presence  in  a  movie  almost  guaranteeing  box  office  success.  Brown's  book  has  become  a  publishing  phenomenon,  consistently  topping  book  charts  in  the  UK  and  US.  It  has  sold  more  than  eight  million  copies  worldwide  in  little  over  two  years.  It  is  a  classic  whodunit,  which  centres  on  a  global  conspiracy  surrounding  the  Holy  Grail  mythology  and  places  heavy  emphasis  on  symbols  and  cryptography.  Its  protagonist  is  a  Harvard  professor  likened  to  a  contemporary  Indiana  Jones,  who  also  appeared  in  Brown's  first  book  Angels  and  Demons.  The  tale  mixes  art  history  with  mythology,  semiotics  with  medieval  history. "

Traders  said  there  was  some  panic  selling  during  Friday's  session,  the  first  since  a  three-day  market  closure  to  mourn  the  death  of  Mr  Hariri.  Beirut's  benchmark  BLOM  stock  index  closed  down  7.9%  at  642.80.  |||    Solidere,  in  which  Mr  Hariri  was  a  major  shareholder,  was  the  major  drag  on  the  index.  The  company  owns  much  of  the  property  in  central  Beirut,  which  it  restored  and  redeveloped  following  the  end  of  Lebanon's  bitter  15-year  civil  war.  ""Solidere  should  be  above  $10  but  because  of  this  disaster  it  is  falling,""  said  one  trader.  ""If  Solidere  drops  much  lower  I  would  consider  it  a  buying  opportunity.  This  is  a  very  big  company  held  by  many  Lebanese.""  Critics  had  accused  Mr  Hariri  of  using  Lebanon's  post-war  reconstruction  drive  for  his  personal  financial  gain.  But  his  assassination  on  Monday  sent  shudders  through  Lebanon's  business  community,  which  saw  the  billionaire  tycoon  as  the  country's  best  hope  for  economic  revival.  Solidere  posted  profits  of  $12.5m  in  the  first  half  of  2004,  and  its  shares  had  been  gaining  in  recent  months. "

0,"German  business  confidence  slides  |||    German  business  confidence  fell  in  February  knocking  hopes  of  a  speedy  recovery  in  Europe's  largest  economy.  |||    Munich-based  research  institute  Ifo  said  that  its  confidence  index  fell  to  95.5  in  February  from  97.5  in  January,  its  first  decline  in  three  months.  The  study  found  that  the  outlook  in  both  the  manufacturing  and  retail  sectors  had  worsened.  Observers  had  been  hoping  that  a  more  confident  business  sector  would  signal  that  economic  activity  was  picking  up.  |||    ""We're  surprised  that  the  Ifo  index  has  taken  such  a  knock,""  said  DZ  bank  economist  Bernd  Weidensteiner.  ""The  main  reason  is  probably  that  the  domestic  economy  is  still  weak,  particularly  in  the  retail  trade.""  Economy  and  Labour  Minister  Wolfgang  Clement  called  the  dip  in  February's  Ifo  confidence  figure  ""a  very  mild  decline"".  He  said  that  despite  the  retreat,  the  index  remained  at  a  relatively  high  level  and  that  he  expected  ""a  modest  economic  upswing""  to  continue.  |||    Germany's  economy  grew  1.6%  last  year  after  shrinking  in  2003.  However,  the  economy  contracted  by  0.2%  during  the  last  three  months  of  2004,  mainly  due  to  the  reluctance  of  consumers  to  spend.  Latest  indications  are  that  growth  is  still  proving  elusive  and  Ifo  president  Hans-Werner  Sinn  said  any  improvement  in  German  domestic  demand  was  sluggish.  Exports  had  kept  things  going  during  the  first  half  of  2004,  but  demand  for  exports  was  then  hit  as  the  value  of  the  euro  hit  record  levels  making  German  products  less  competitive  overseas.  On  top  of  that,  the  unemployment  rate  has  been  stuck  at  close  to  10%  and  manufacturing  firms,  including  DaimlerChrysler,  Siemens  and  Volkswagen,  have  been  negotiating  with  unions  over  cost  cutting  measures.  Analysts  said  that  the  Ifo  figures  and  Germany's  continuing  problems  may  delay  an  interest  rate  rise  by  the  European  Central  Bank.  Eurozone  interest  rates  are  at  2%,  but  comments  from  senior  officials  have  recently  focused  on  the  threat  of  inflation,  prompting  fears  that  interest  rates  may  rise. "

0,"Japan  turns  to  beer  alternatives  |||    Japanese  brewers  are  increasingly  making  money  from  beer-flavoured  drinks  rather  than  beer  itself  |||    Beer  and  spirits  are  heavily  taxed  in  Japan,  driving  breweries  to  search  for  alternatives.  Japan's  long  economic  downturn  helped  drive  the  trend,  as  drinkers  looked  for  cheaper  opportunities  to  drown  their  sorrows.  Now,  according  to  Asahi  Breweries,  the  market  for  so-called  ""beer-like""  drinks  is  set  to  grow  84%  this  year.  |||    Asahi  is  predicting  profits  to  rise  50%  in  2005  as  it  launches  a  drink  based  on  soybean  peptides  rather  than  malt.  The  chosen  name,  ""Shinnama""  or  ""new  draft"",  disguises  its  non-beer  nature.  But  despite  a  record  profit  in  2004  of  30.6bn  yen  ($291m;  £154m),  up  31.8%  on  the  previous  year,  Asahi  is  coming  late  to  the  market.  Key  rival  Sapporo  is  already  well-established  with  the  beer-flavoured  ""Draft  One"".  Suntory,  meanwhile,  is  doing  well  with  ""Super  Blue"",  which  combines  happoshu  -  an  existing  low-cost  beer  alternative  made  with  malt  and  seawater  -  and  shochu,  a  distilled  alcohol  derived  from  sweet  potatoes  or  barley.  Happoshu  has  been  a  mainstay  of  brewery  profits  for  years,  taking  over  from  beer  thanks  to  its  low  tax  and  therefore  low  cost.  Kirin,  the  fourth  big  name,  is  launching  its  own  ""third-type""  drink  in  April. "

2,"UKIP  could  sue  Veritas  defectors  |||    The  UK  Independence  Party  could  take  legal  action  to  unseat  two  London  Assembly  members  who  defected  to  Robert  Kilroy  Silk's  Veritas  Party.  |||    Damian  Hockney,  now  Veritas  deputy  leader,  and  Peter  Hulme-Cross  were  elected  in  2004  on  the  list  system.  The  party  argues  the  pair  should  give  up  their  seats  as  they  won  them  as  UKIP  representatives,  not  as  individuals.  Mr  Hockney  said  the  law  was  clear  that  those  elected  on  a  list  who  quit  their  party  should  keep  their  seats.  UKIP  chairman  Petrina  Holdsworth  urged  the  men  to  step  down  from  the  GLA  in  a  letter.  |||    She  said:  ""The  party  has  taken  legal  advice  and  it  is  clear  that  we  could  take  legal  proceedings  against  you  which  could  result  in  the  return  of  our  seats  and/or  damages  against  you.  ""We  would  however  like  you  to  be  given  an  opportunity  to  reflect  on  what  you  have  done,  to  restore  your  own  credibility  with  the  electorate  and  return  the  seats  to  the  party  which  won  them  fair  and  square  at  the  last  election.""  Mr  Hockney  said  the  law  worked  in  exactly  the  same  way  for  the  GLA  as  it  did  for  other  electoral  list  systems.  ""The  Greater  London  Act  is  clear  that  if  someone  resigns  who  was  elected  on  a  list,  their  party  whip  the  seat  belongs  to  them  and  not  the  party.""  He  said  Mr  Hulme-Cross  and  himself  had  no  intention  of  resigning  and  added  that  they  felt  that  it  was  UKIP  who  were  not  being  true  to  the  electorate.  He  accused  the  party  of  signing  up  to  a  deal  with  the  Tories  in  Europe,  rather  than  sticking  to  an  independent  stance.  But  the  claim  was  denied  by  UKIP  spokesman,  who  said:  ""Mr  Hockney's  accusations  are  like  his  sense  of  political  morals  -  empty.""  Veritas  was  formed  by  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  earlier  this  month  after  he  quit  UKIP  following  an  unsuccessful  bid  to  take  over  as  leader. "

0,"Car  giant  hit  by  Mercedes  slump  |||    A  slump  in  profitability  at  luxury  car  maker  Mercedes  has  prompted  a  big  drop  in  profits  at  parent  DaimlerChrysler.  |||    The  German-US  carmaker  saw  fourth  quarter  operating  profits  fall  to  785m  euros  ($1bn)  from  2.4bn  euros  in  2003.  Mercedes-Benz's  woes  -  its  profits  slid  to  just  20m  euros  -  obscured  a  strong  performance  from  the  Chrysler  group  whose  returns  met  market  expectations.  Mercedes  faces  fierce  competition  in  the  luxury  car  sector  from  BMW  and  but  hopes  to  revive  its  fortunes  by  2006.  |||    Mercedes'  profits  over  the  period  compared  unfavourably  with  2003's  784m  euro  figure  and  were  well  below  analyst  expectations  of  374m  euros.  For  the  year  as  a  whole,  its  operating  profits  fell  46%  to  1.6bn  euros.  Sales  of  Mercedes'  brands  fell  2%  as  demand  cooled,  while  revenues  were  affected  by  the  weakness  of  the  US  dollar.  |||    The  carmaker  blamed  the  fall  in  profits  on  high  launch  costs  for  new  models  and  losses  from  its  Mercedes  Smart  mini-car  range.  Mercedes  is  hoping  to  increase  productivity  by  3bn  euros,  having  negotiated  500m  euros  in  annual  savings  with  German  workers  last  year.  The  firm  said  it  was  determined  to  retain  Mercedes'  position  as  the  world's  most  successful  luxury  brand.  However,  DaimlerChrysler's  shares  fell  1.5%  on  the  news.  ""While  all  these  divisions  are  doing  well  the  big  worries  continue  to  surround  Mercedes-Benz,""  Michael  Rabb,  an  analyst  with  Bank  Sal  Oppenheim,  told  Reuters.  |||    In  contrast,  Chrysler  enjoyed  a  5%  annual  increase  in  unit  sales  while  revenues  -  calculated  in  US  dollars  -  rose  10%.  The  US  division  -  whose  marques  include  Dodge  and  Jeep  -  transformed  a  full  year  operating  loss  of  506m  euros  in  2003  into  a  1.4bn  euros  profit  last  year.  |||    Overall,  DaimlerChrysler  saw  worldwide  vehicle  sales  rise  8%  to  4.7  million  in  2004  while  total  revenues  added  4%  to  142bn  euros.  Chrysler's  strong  performance  helped  the  world's  fifth  largest  carmaker  boost  net  income  by  400m  euros  to  2.5bn  euros.  |||    ""The  year  2004  shows  that  our  strategy  works  well  -  even  in  such  a  challenging  competitive  environment,""  said  Jurgen  Schrempp,  DaimlerChrysler's  chairman.  DaimlerChrysler  took  a  475m  euro  hit  in  costs  stemming  from  a  defects  scandal  at  its  joint  venture,  Japanese  subsidiary  Fuso.  DaimlerChrysler  last  week  agreed  a  compensation  package  with  partner  Mitsubishi  Motors  which  will  see  it  buy  out  its  stake  in  Fuso.  Looking  forward,  DaimerChrysler's  profits  are  expected  to  be  slightly  higher  in  2005.  However,  it  is  expecting  ""significant  improvements""  in  profitability  in  2006  as  a  result  of  a  major  investment  in  the  Mercedes  product  range. "

0,"Banker  loses  sexism  claim  |||    A  former  executive  at  the  London  offices  of  Merrill  Lynch  has  lost  her  £7.5m  ($14.6m)  sex  discrimination  case  against  the  US  investment  bank.  |||    An  employment  tribunal  dismissed  Stephanie  Villalba's  allegations  of  sexual  discrimination  and  unequal  pay.  But  the  42-year-old  won  her  claim  of  unfair  dismissal,  resulting  from  her  sacking  in  August  2003.  Her  partial  victory  is  likely  to  cap  her  compensation  to  about  £55,000,  a  tiny  fraction  of  what  she  asked  for.  The  extent  of  damages  will  be  assessed  in  the  New  Year.  The  action  -  the  biggest  claim  heard  by  an  employment  tribunal  in  the  UK  -  had  been  viewed  as  something  of  a  test  case.  |||    The  tribunal  decided  that  Ms  Villalba  had  been  unfairly  dismissed  because,  having  been  removed  from  a  senior  post,  she  was  entitled  to  wait  to  see  if  a  suitable  alternative  position  could  be  found  in  the  organisation.  Ms  Villalba,  the  former  head  of  Merrill's  private  client  business  in  Europe,  has  made  no  decision  on  whether  to  appeal.  |||    A  spokesman  for  her  lawyers  described  the  decision  as  ""very  disappointing"",  but  pointed  to  some  criticism  of  Merrill's  procedures  within  the  lengthy  judgement.  The  tribunal  upheld  Ms  Villalba's  claim  of  victimisation  on  certain  specific  issues,  including  bullying  e-mails  in  connection  with  a  contract,  but  said  it  found  no  evidence  of  ""laddish  culture""  at  the  bank.  ""We  said  from  the  start  that  this  case  was  about  performance  not  gender,""  Merrill  said  in  a  statement.  ""Ms  Villalba  was  removed  by  the  very  same  person  who  had  promoted  her  into  the  position  and  who  then  replaced  her  with  another  woman.  ""Merrill  Lynch  is  dedicated  to  creating  a  true  meritocracy  where  every  employee  has  the  opportunity  to  advance  based  on  their  skills  and  hard  work.""  |||    Based  in  London's  financial  district,  Ms  Villalba  worked  for  Merrill's  global  private  client  business  in  Europe,  investing  funds  for  some  of  Merrill's  most  important  customers.  But  in  2003  her  employers  told  her  she  had  no  future  after  17  years  with  the  company,  and  she  was  made  redundant.  Merrill  Lynch  denied  Ms  Villalba's  claims  and  said  she  was  removed  from  her  post  because  of  the  extensive  losses  the  firm  was  suffering  on  the  continent.  The  firm  had  told  the  tribunal  that  Ms  Villalba's  division  had  been  losing  about  $1m  a  week.  Merrill  said  Ms  Villalba  lacked  the  leadership  skills  to  turn  around  the  unit. "

2,"Ex-PM  Lord  Callaghan  dies  aged  92  |||    Former  Labour  prime  minister  Lord  Callaghan  has  died  on  the  eve  of  his  93rd  birthday.  |||    He  passed  away  at  home  in  East  Sussex,  just  11  days  after  his  wife  Audrey  died  aged  91.  Lord  Callaghan,  who  leaves  a  son  and  two  daughters,  was  the  longest  living  former  British  PM  in  history.  He  entered  Downing  Street  in  1976  after  the  resignation  of  Harold  Wilson.  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  called  him  a  ""giant""  of  the  Labour  movement.  He  held  each  of  the  major  offices  of  chancellor,  home  secretary,  foreign  secretary  and  prime  minister  during  his  career  and  became  Lord  Callaghan  of  Cardiff  in  1987.  |||    Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  said  the  former  PM  would  be  ""mourned  throughout  the  world"".  ""It  was  a  commitment  to  public  service  that  brought  Jim  Callaghan  into  Parliament  in  1945,  and  while  Jim  rose  to  the  top  he  never  forgot  his  roots.""  Former  cabinet  colleague  Lord  Hattersley  said  his  first  reaction  on  hearing  the  news  was  ""immense  sadness"".  |||    ""It  was  not  a  major  surprise  -  I  knew  what  a  blow  the  death  of  his  wife  Audrey  was  a  few  days  ago,""  he  said.  ""He  was  a  decent  kindly  man  who  helped  me  and  my  generation  of  politicians  immensely.  |||    ""The  Labour  party  and  the  country  will  be  poorer  without  him.""  Conservative  peer  Lord  Heseltine  said  that  despite  their  political  differences,  he  and  Lord  Callaghan  became  friends.  ""You  don't  get  to  the  premiership  unless  you  have  a  streak  of  determination,""  he  said.  ""But  I  saw  the  other  side  of  Jim  Callaghan,  he  became  a  personal  friend  in  a  way,  and  my  family  and  I  were  very  fond  of  him.""  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  said  he  would  be  remembered  with  ""affection  and  respect"".  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  said:  ""When  I  was  first  elected  in  1983  as  the  youngest  MP,  he  was  the  ""Father  of  the  House""  and  as  such  took  a  very  keen  interest  in  my  early  days  in  Parliament.  |||    ""He  was  always  full  of  warmth  and  wisdom.""  Born  in  1912  and  educated  at  Portsmouth  Northern  Secondary  School,  Lord  Callaghan  became  a  clerk  at  the  Inland  Revenue.  He  enlisted  in  the  Royal  Navy  in  1942  and  rose  to  the  rank  of  lieutenant.  Elected  for  a  Cardiff  constituency  at  the  1945  general  election,  he  represented  Cardiff  seats  for  more  than  40  years.  After  serving  as  a  junior  minister  in  the  Attlee  government,  he  became  chancellor  of  the  exchequer  when  Labour  returned  to  power  in  1964.  |||    With  sterling  under  pressure,  he  resisted  devaluation  for  three  years,  before  being  forced  into  it  in  1967.  His  political  career  was  not  without  controversy.  When  he  refused  to  support  prime  minister  Harold  Wilson  and  Dame  Barbara  Castle  over  the  latter's  trade  union  manifesto,  In  Place  of  Strife,  in  1968,  he  said:  ""I  am  not  going  to  resign.  They  will  have  to  throw  me  out"".  When  home  secretary,  he  ordered  British  troops  to  march  into  the  streets  of  Belfast  to  protect  Catholic  civilians  amid  rising  violence  -  a  decision  that  has  dominated  British  politics  into  the  21st  century.  |||    As  foreign  secretary  in  the  early  1970s,  Lord  Callaghan  kept  an  open  mind  about  the  UK's  entry  into  the  Common  Market,  seeing  the  advantages  of  the  UK's  entry.  He  once  travelled  to  Idi  Amin's  Uganda  in  1975  to  plead  for  the  life  of  a  British  lecturer,  Dennis  Hills,  who  was  under  a  death  sentence  for  treason.  |||    His  political  life  was  often  tempered  by  battles  against  the  hard  left  of  the  party.  In  the  autumn  of  1978,  before  the  ""Winter  of  Discontent""  when  trade  unions  carried  out  strikes  that  brought  the  country  to  a  standstill,  Lord  Callaghan  refused  to  hold  an  early  election  which  may  have  delivered  a  Labour  victory.  As  garbage  lay  uncollected  in  the  streets  and  hospital  staff,  council  workers  and  even  gravediggers  stayed  off  work,  Lord  Callaghan  failed  to  predict  the  mood  of  the  country.  When  Britain  went  to  the  polls  in  1979,  Tory  leader  Margaret  Thatcher  was  swept  into  power  in  a  landslide  victory,  and  Lord  Callaghan  resigned  as  Labour  leader. "

1,"Oscar  nominees  lack  pulling  power  |||    This  year's  clutch  of  Oscar  nominees  have  been  the  least  popular  for  20  years  according  to  box  office  figures.  |||    In  the  US  the  five  nominated  for  best  film  have  been  seen  by  50%  fewer  people  than  movies  in  previous  years.  While  the  awards  are  not  based  on  box  office  popularity  there  is  concern  for  the  ratings  of  the  televised  ceremony.  ""We  don't  have  a  Titanic  or  a  Lord  of  the  Rings  out  there.  I  think  it's  fair  to  say  it  does  concern  us  a  bit,""  said  Academy  executive  director  Bruce  Davis.  About  51  million  people  in  the  US  have  seen  this  year's  nominees,  compared  with  between  100  million  and  118  million  in  recent  years.  The  last  time  combined  attendance  was  so  low  was  in  1984  when  Amadeus  beat  The  Killing  Fields,  A  Passage  to  India,  Places  in  the  Heart  and  A  Soldier's  Story  to  best  picture,  when  41  million  saw  the  five  films.  Last  year's  ceremony  attracted  the  highest  audience  in  four  years  as  viewers  tuned  in  to  see  Lord  of  the  Ring:  Return  of  the  King  sweep  the  board.  |||    And  the  show  reaped  its  biggest  audience  in  1997  when  Titanic  took  home  11  Oscars.  |||    The  film  had  taken  $500m  (£264m)  worldwide  before  the  ceremony,  and  eventually  took  $1.8bn  (£952m).  ""Eyeballs  starring  at  the  movie  screen  translates  to  eyeballs  staring  at  the  TV  screen,""  said  Paul  Dergarabedian  of  box  office  tracker  Exhibitor  Relations.  ""People  like  to  have  a  vested  interest  in  what  they're  watching.  ""When  Titanic  does  $1.8bn  in  worldwide  box  office,  you've  got  a  lot  of  people  with  a  vested  interest.""  Past  years  have  also  seen  blockbusters  such  as  Saving  Private  Ryan,  Forrest  Gump  and  Ghost  compete  for  Oscars.  The  biggest  box  office  hitter  among  this  year's  nominees  is  The  Aviator,  which  has  taken  $90m  (£48m)  in  the  US,  although  takings  in  the  UK  have  reached  only  £7m  so  far.  |||    Low-budget  move  Sideways  and  Finding  Neverland  have  so  far  grossed  about  $45m  (£24m)  each.  The  year's  biggest  blockbusters  do  actually  feature  in  the  Oscar  nominees  but  in  the  animation  category.  Shrek  2  and  The  Incredibles  took  $436m  (£231m)  while  The  Incredibles  took  $259m  (£137m).  Mel  Gibson's  The  Passion  of  the  Christ,  which  took  $370m  (£196m)  in  the  US,  was  largely  ignored  by  Academy  voters.  |||    But  many  in  the  film  industry  do  not  equate  award  and  box  office  success.  ""I  have  never  equated  the  Academy  Awards  with  how  much  money  a  movie  takes  in,""  said  Nikki  Rocco,  head  of  distribution  at  Universal  which  released  nominee  Ray.  ""That's  the  People's  Choice  Awards.  This  is  not  about  the  public.  This  is  about  the  industry  bestowing  awards  on  what  they  think  are  the  best  films  of  the  year."" "

1,"Elvis  set  to  top  UK  singles  chart  |||    Rock  'n'  roll  legend  Elvis  is  set  to  top  the  UK  singles  chart  on  Sunday,  27  years  after  his  death.  |||    The  re-release  of  hit  song  Jailhouse  Rock  was  out-selling  X  Factor  winner  Steve  Brockstein's  cover  of  Against  All  Odds  by  2,000  copies  on  Tuesday.  If  the  record  does  make  the  top  spot,  it  will  be  Elvis'  19th  UK  number  one.  The  last  time  he  topped  the  charts  was  with  the  remix  of  the  little-known  song  A  Little  Less  Conversation,  which  was  number  one  in  June  2002.  If  Jailhouse  Rock  does  reach  number  one  on  Sunday,  it  will  be  the  999th  in  the  history  of  the  UK  pop  charts.  The  song  first  topped  the  charts  in  1958.  Chart  analysts  say  Elvis  could  score  the  1000th  number  one  as  well.  His  record  One  Night  will  be  released  the  following  week,  followed  the  week  after  by  A  Fool  Such  As  I,  as  part  of  his  record  company  SonyBMG's  new  Elvis  campaign.  It  has  called  it  ""the  most  ambitious  singles  release  campaign  in  the  history  of  the  UK  record  industry"". "

2,"Anglers  'could  face  prosecution'  |||    Anglers  and  fishermen  could  find  themselves  prosecuted  under  plans  to  crack  down  on  animal  cruelty,  a  committee  of  MPs  has  warned.  |||    Sloppy  wording  of  the  draft  animal  welfare  bill  could  leave  anglers  facing  court  even  though  it  was  not  intended,  the  environment  select  committee  said.  The  MPs  said  they  were  ""concerned""  the  government  had  not  consulted  directly  on  its  plans  to  improve  animal  welfare.  They  raised  complex  and  emotive  issues  which  needed  to  be  resolved,  MPs  said.  |||    They  called  for  a  ""cast-iron  guarantee""  that  the  government  consults  on  any  plans  to  regulate  animal  industries  like  pet  fairs  and  game  bird  rearing.  The  draft  bill  seeks  to  modernise  and  improve  animal  welfare  legislation,  and  intends  to  protect  ""kept  animals""  and  ""companion""  animals  by  setting  up  a  ""duty  of  care"".  In  addition  to  maintaining  existing  cruelty  offences,  it  creates  an  offence  of  neglect  by  keepers  who  fail  to  protect  the  animals  for  whom  they  are  responsible.  The  bill  would  allow  animal  welfare  officers  to  intervene  to  prevent  harm  to  an  animal  as  well  as  outlawing  ""mutilation""  of  animals  -  unless  it  can  be  demonstrated  to  be  in  the  animal's  best  interest.  |||    The  environment  select  committee  made  101  recommendations  after  hearing  evidence  from  51  organisations  and  individuals.  One  was  a  call  to  amend  the  bill  so  that  prosecutions  against  those  engaged  in  fishing  were  not  inadvertently  encouraged  -  even  if  they  were  to  later  fail.  ""We  accept  that  neither  commercial  fishing  nor  recreational  angling  should  fall  within  the  remit  of  the  of  the  draft  bill  and  we  therefore  support  the  government's  intention  to  exempt  fishing  as  an  activity.""  |||    But  the  committee  said  an  amendment  was  needed  to  ensure  cases  were  not  brought.  ""However,  in  exempting  fishing,  the  government  should  be  careful  to  ensure  that  those  persons  who  catch  fish  are  not  given  'carte  blanche'  to  inflict  unnecessary  suffering  in  the  course  of  pursuing  this  activity,""  the  committee  added.  The  committee  also  said  some  legal  protections  for  animals  were  downgraded  by  the  bill,  such  as  the  law  on  abandonment  of  animals  which  ""would  be  significantly  weakened"".  MPs  urged  the  government  to  redraft  clauses  relating  to  the  prosecution  of  cruelty  offences.  This  was  because  as  it  stood  the  draft  bill  would  allow  certain  acts  that  should  be  prosecuted  -  such  as  unnecessary  suffering  caused  to  an  animal  through  neglect,  or  unnecessary  mental  suffering  -  to  go  unpunished.  |||    Committee  chairman  Michael  Jack  said:  ""Any  change  in  the  law  as  it  affects  animals  always  arouses  powerful  emotions  and  great  public  interest.  ""This  draft  bill  is  no  exception.  My  committee  welcomes  the  development  of  an  approach  to  animal  welfare  which  doesn't  just  wait  for  a  problem  to  occur  but  enables  action  to  be  taken  to  protect  animals  before  irreversible  suffering  takes  place.""  But  Mr  Jack  said  the  bill  ""very  much  had  the  feel  of  a  'work  in  progress',  and  urged  the  government  to  guarantee  that  ""an  obligation  to  consult  will  be  enshrined  in  law""  before  it  extended  legislative  plans  to  areas  such  as  pet  fairs,  circuses  and  game  bird  farms.  ""The  government  must  work  hard  to  take  the  rough  edges  of  its  initial  proposals  before  the  bill  is  introduced  to  Parliament,""  he  added. "

1,"Streets  have  'album  of  the  year'  |||    The  Streets,  aka  British  rapper  and  songwriter,  Mike  Skinner  have  topped  a  poll  to  find  the  year's  best  album.  |||    A  Grand  Don't  Come  for  Free  beat  Keane's  Hope  and  Fears  in  second  place  with  Franz  Ferdinand's  self-titled  album  third,  in  the  Q  magazine  poll.  Skinner  uses  blunt  beats  under  streetwise  lyrics  about  such  things  as  falling  in  love  and  drink  and  drugs.  Q  Magazine  said:  ""A  Grand  Don't  Come  for  Free  captured  the  country's  mood  in  a  way  no  one  could  have  predicted.""  A  Grand  Don't  Come  for  Free  is  the  second  album  from  The  Streets.  It  followed  Original  Pirate  Material.  Q  Magazine  also  had  praise  for  the  runners-up  in  the  poll.  Keane's  Hopes  and  Fears,  was  described  as  a  ""revelatory  debut""  which  showed  ""they  had  songwriting  flair  to  spare"".  It  also  said  Franz  Ferdinand's  album  sounded  ""natural,  unforced  (and)  under-produced"".  Rock  band  U2's  latest  album  How  to  Dismantle  an  Atomic  Bomb  came  fourth  while  Razorlight's  Up  All  Night  was  in  fifth  place.  Others  notables  on  the  list  included  Dizzee  Rascal  in  at  number  12  and  The  Zutons  at  20.  Estelle  came  in  at  39,  Joss  Stone  was  40th  and  Jamelia  took  the  44th  place. "

2,"Howard  denies  split  over  ID  cards  |||    Michael  Howard  has  denied  his  shadow  cabinet  was  split  over  its  decision  to  back  controversial  Labour  plans  to  introduce  ID  cards.  |||    The  Tory  leader  said  his  front  bench  team  had  reached  a  ""collective  view""  after  holding  a  ""good  discussion"",  but  admitted  it  was  ""not  an  easy  issue"".  He  had  decided  to  support  the  plans  as  the  police  said  they  would  help  fight  terror,  crime  and  illegal  immigration.  The  Lib  Dems  have  pledged  to  oppose  the  bill  when  it  is  debated  next  Monday.  |||    Tory  sources  say  senior  party  figures  had  argued  vociferously  against  the  ID  card  scheme.  Among  those  reported  to  have  serious  reservations  over  the  strategy  were  senior  shadow  cabinet  members  David  Davis,  Oliver  Letwin  and  Tim  Yeo.  But  Mr  Howard  denied  Mr  Yeo,  his  transport  and  environment  spokesman,  said  the  plans  ""stink"".  He  also  said  he  was  confident  shadow  home  secretary  Mr  Davis  would  ""set  out  the  position  very  clearly""  when  he  stands  up  to  debate  the  matter  next  week.  Mr  Howard  said  the  police  had  said  ID  cards  could  ""help  them  foil  a  terror  bomb  plot  in  which  people  could  lose  their  lives"".  He  added:  ""When  the  police  say  that  you  have  to  take  them  seriously"".  |||    He  acknowledged  there  were  ""good  libertarian  arguments""  against  the  cards,  but  said  the  shadow  Cabinet  had  weighed  up  all  the  ""conflicting  interests""  before  reaching  its  decision.  ""I  don't  pretend  that  it  is  an  easy  decision  but  at  the  end  of  the  day  a  decision  has  to  be  taken.""  He  also  denied  he  was  afraid  of  looking  ""soft""  on  the  issue,  compared  to  Labour.  The  Conservatives  announced  their  support  for  the  government  plans  on  Monday  evening.  |||    Sources  within  the  party  told  the  BBC  Mr  Howard  had  always  been  in  favour  of  ID  cards,  and  tried  to  introduce  them  when  he  was  Home  Secretary.  But  the  Tories  insisted  they  would  hold  ministers  to  account  over  the  precise  purpose  of  the  scheme.  |||    They  said  they  would  also  press  Labour  over  whether  objectives  could  be  met  and  whether  the  Home  Office  would  be  able  to  deliver  them.  And  they  pledged  to  assess  the  cost  effectiveness  of  ID  cards  and  whether  people's  privacy  would  be  properly  protected.  ""It  is  important  to  remember  that  this  bill  will  take  a  decade  to  come  into  full  effect,""  a  spokesman  said.  Lib  Dem  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  has  branded  the  ID  scheme  a  waste  of  money  and  ""deeply  flawed"".  He  said:  ""This  has  all  the  signs  of  Michael  Howard  overruling  colleagues'  concerns  over  ID  cards.""  |||    The  chairman  of  the  Bar  Council,  Guy  Mansfield  QC  warned  there  was  a  real  risk  that  people  on  the  ""margins  of  society""  would  be  driven  into  the  hands  of  extremists.  ""What  is  going  to  happen  to  young  Asian  men  when  there  has  been  a  bomb  gone  off  somewhere?  They  are  going  to  be  stopped.  If  they  haven't  [ID  cards]  they  are  going  to  be  detained.""  Tory  ex-minister  Douglas  Hogg  said  he  opposed  the  plans  for  ID  cards  branding  them  a  ""regressive""  step  which  would  intrude  into  the  lives  of  ordinary  citizens  without  any  counterbalancing  benefits.  He  predicted  ultimately  carrying  the  cards  would  become  compulsory  and  that  would  lead  to  large  numbers  of  Britain's  ethnic  minorities  being  stopped  by  police. "

2,"Milburn  defends  poster  campaign  |||    Labour's  election  chief  Alan  Milburn  has  defended  his  party's  campaign  posters  amid  Tory  claims  the  ads  were  nothing  short  of  ""sly  anti-Semitism"".  |||    Mr  Milburn  said  he  appreciated  people's  concerns,  but  insisted  that  ""what  they  were  was  anti-Tory""  and  ""not  in  any  way,  shape  or  form  anti-Semitic"".  He  was  responding  to  Tory  spokesman  Julian  Lewis  who  said  the  ads  were  part  of  a  wider  trend  of  smearing  the  party.  Labour  has  withdrawn  two  controversial  posters  and  launched  four  new  designs.  |||    A  row  was  sparked  after  the  party  published  posters  appearing  to  depict  Michael  Howard,  who  is  Jewish,  as  Fagin,  and  as  a  flying  pig,  amid  claims  they  were  anti-Semitic.  The  posters  were  labelled  a  ""big  misjudgement""  by  the  Conservatives  who  said  Labour's  ""first  shot  in  the  election  has  badly  backfired"".  |||    The  posters  were  among  a  series  of  ideas  shown  to  Labour  members,  who  were  asked  to  vote  on  their  favourite.  Labour  has  taken  them  off  its  website,  saying  members  preferred  other  posters.  The  party's  four  new  designs,  launched  on  Tuesday,  steer  clear  of  the  Fagin  or  flying  pig  images,  but  make  clear  that  Labour  is  sticking  to  its  strategy  of  targeting  the  Tory  leader  personally,  with  reminders  of  his  record  in  office.  |||    The  posters  were  among  a  series  of  ideas  shown  to  Labour  members,  who  have  been  asked  to  choose  which  one  should  be  used  ahead  of  the  election.  In  the  Commons,  Tory  spokesman  Mr  Lewis  suggested  the  posters  were  part  of  a  wider  trend  and  reminded  MPs  that  Labour  chairman  Ian  McCartney  last  year  described  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  as  a  ""21st  Century  Fagin"".  |||    ""Given  the  outrage  that  that  smear  caused  then,  how  could  you  have  thought  anything  other  than  the  fact  that  what  you  were  doing  in  reviving  it  in  your  poster  advertisements  was  nothing  more  and  nothing  less  than  a  calculated  campaign  of  sly  anti-Semitism?""  Mr  Milburn  replied  that  they  were  not  anti-Semitic.  ""What  they  were  was  anti-Tory  and  I  make  no  apologies  at  all  for  making  clear  to  the  British  public  exactly  what  the  Conservative  plans  would  mean,""  he  said.  ""I  fully  understand  and  indeed  respect  the  views  of  those  who  have  concerns  about  any  poster  designs  that  have  appeared  on  the  Labour  Party  website.""  The  Fagin  and  pigs  might  fly  posters  were  taken  off  Labour's  website  on  Monday  after  supporters  voted  for  their  favourite  poster  featuring  Mr  Howard  and  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  holding  a  blackboard  reading  2+2=5.  A  Labour  spokesman  later  said  their  removal  from  the  party's  website  was  not  affected  by  the  row. "

It  is  competing  against  Sweeney  Todd  and  A  Funny  Thing  Happened  on  the  Way  to  the  Forum  for  the  award.  The  Goat  or  Who  is  Sylvia?  by  Edward  Albee,  The  Pillowman  by  Martin  McDonagh  and  Alan  Bennett's  The  History  Boys  are  shortlisted  in  the  best  play  category.  |||    Pam  Ferris,  Victoria  Hamilton  and  Kelly  Reilly  are  nominated  for  best  actress.  Ferris  -  best  known  for  her  television  roles  in  programmes  such  as  The  Darling  Buds  of  May  -  has  made  the  shortlist  for  her  role  in  Notes  on  Falling  Leaves,  at  the  Royal  Court  Theatre.  Meanwhile,  Richard  Griffiths,  who  plays  Hector  in  The  History  Boys  at  the  National  Theatre,  will  battle  it  out  for  the  best  actor  award  with  Douglas  Hodge  (Dumb  Show)  and  Stanley  Townsend  (Shining  City).  The  best  director  shortlist  includes  Luc  Bondy  for  Cruel  and  Tender,  Simon  McBurney  for  Measure  for  Measure,  and  Rufus  Norris  for  Festen.  |||    Festen  is  also  shortlisted  in  the  best  designer  category  where  Ian  MacNeil,  Jean  Kalman  and  Paul  Arditti  will  be  up  against  Hildegard  Bechtler,  for  Iphigenia  at  Aulis,  and  Paul  Brown,  for  False  Servant.  The  Milton  Shulman  Award  for  outstanding  newcomer  will  be  presented  to  Dominic  Cooper  (His  Dark  Materials  and  The  History  Boys),  Romola  Garai  (Calico),  Eddie  Redmayne  (The  Goat,  or  Who  is  Sylvia?)  or  Ben  Wishaw  (Hamlet).  And  playwrights  David  Eldridge,  Rebecca  Lenkiewicz  and  Owen  McCafferty  will  fight  it  out  for  The  Charles  Wintour  Award  and  a  £30,000  bursary.  Three  50th  Anniversary  Special  Awards  will  also  be  presented  to  an  institution,  a  playwright  and  an  individual. "

0,"French  consumer  spending  rising  |||    French  consumers  increased  their  spending  by  1.5%  in  January,  a  figure  which  bodes  well  for  the  country's  economic  growth,  figures  revealed.  |||    The  National  Statistic  Institute  (INSEE)  added  that  consumer  spending  in  January  rose  3.8%  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  Rising  sales  of  household  equipment  were  behind  the  increase.  The  INSEE  also  said  that  French  consumer  prices  fell  0.6%  in  January,  but  were  up  1.6%  on  an  annual  basis.  |||    Despite  the  general  increase  in  spending  in  January,  French  households  bought  fewer  cars  in  January.  According  to  the  INSEE,  car  sales  fell  2.8%  in  January,  following  a  fall  of  0.6%  in  December.  But  on  a  year-on-year  basis,  the  sector  still  saw  a  sales  increase  of  6.5%.  Consumer  spending  fuelled  France's  economic  growth  in  the  last  quarter  of  2004  and  analysts  expect  that  it  will  continue  to  support  the  economy.  ""It's  a  growth  that  will  remain  fragile  and  vulnerable  to  risks  like  a  strong  rise  in  long-term  interest  rates,  tension  in  the  oil  price,""  Emmanuel  Ferry,  from  Exane  BNP  Paribas  told  Reuters  news  agency.  |||    Meanwhile  in  Italy,  consumer  confidence  rose  to  its  highest  level  since  October  2004.  Economic  research  group  ISAE  has  said  that  Italian  consumer  confidence  rose  to  104.4  from  103.3,  despite  a  slight  deterioration  in  short-term  sentiment. "

0,"Ask  Jeeves  tips  online  ad  revival  |||    Ask  Jeeves  has  become  the  third  leading  online  search  firm  this  week  to  thank  a  revival  in  internet  advertising  for  improving  fortunes.  |||    The  firm's  revenue  nearly  tripled  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2004,  exceeding  $86m  (£46m).  Ask  Jeeves,  once  among  the  best-known  names  on  the  web,  is  now  a  relatively  modest  player.  Its  $17m  profit  for  the  quarter  was  dwarfed  by  the  $204m  announced  by  rival  Google  earlier  in  the  week.  During  the  same  quarter,  Yahoo  earned  $187m,  again  tipping  a  resurgence  in  online  advertising.  |||    The  trend  has  taken  hold  relatively  quickly.  Late  last  year,  marketing  company  Doubleclick,  one  of  the  leading  providers  of  online  advertising,  warned  that  some  or  all  of  its  business  would  have  to  be  put  up  for  sale.  But  on  Thursday,  it  announced  that  a  sharp  turnaround  had  brought  about  an  unexpected  increase  in  profits.  Neither  Ask  Jeeves  nor  Doubleclick  thrilled  investors  with  their  profit  news,  however.  In  both  cases,  their  shares  fell  by  some  4%.  Analysts  attributed  the  falls  to  excessive  expectations  in  some  quarters,  fuelled  by  the  dramatic  outperformance  of  Google  on  Tuesday. "

0,"Indy  buys  into  India  paper  |||    Irish  publishing  group  Independent  News  &  Media  is  buying  up  a  26%  stake  in  Indian  newspaper  company  Jagran  in  a  deal  worth  25m  euros  ($34.1m).  |||    Jagran  publishes  India's  top-selling  daily  newspaper,  the  Hindi-language  Dainik  Jagran,  which  has  been  in  circulation  for  62  years.  News  of  the  deal  came  as  the  group  announced  that  its  results  would  meet  market  forecasts.  The  company  reported  strong  revenue  growth  across  all  its  major  markets.  |||    Group  advertising  revenues  were  up  over  10%  year-on-year,  the  group  said,  with  overall  circulation  revenues  are  expected  to  increase  almost  10%  year-on-year.  This  was  helped  by  the  positive  impact  of  ""compact""  newspaper  editions  in  Ireland  and  the  UK,  it  said.  ""2004  has  proven  to  be  an  important  year  for  Independent  News  &  Media,""  said  chief  executive  Sir  Anthony  O'Reilly.  ""Our  simple  aim  at  Independent  is  to  be  the  low  cost  producer  in  every  region  in  which  we  operate.  I  am  confident  that  we  will  show  a  meaningful  increase  in  earnings  for  2005.""  |||    Meanwhile,  the  group  made  no  comment  about  the  future  of  the  Independent  newspaper  despite  recent  speculation  that  Sir  Anthony  had  held  talks  with  potential  buyers  over  a  stake  in  the  daily  publication.  He  has  consistently  denied  suggestions  that  the  Independent  and  the  Independent  on  Sunday  are  up  for  sale.  Buy  it  is  understood  that  the  recent  success  of  the  smaller  edition  of  the  Independent,  which  has  pushed  circulation  up  by  20%  to  260,000,  has  prompted  interest  from  industry  rivals,  with  Daily  Mail  &  General  Trust  tipped  as  the  most  likely  suitor.  The  loss-making  newspaper  is  not  expected  to  reach  break-even  until  2006. "

Party  chief  executive  Lord  Rennard  said  the  appointment  was  a  ""significant  strengthening  of  the  Lib  Dem  team"".

1,"Fox  'too  reliant  on  reality  TV'  |||    The  head  of  US  TV  network  Fox  has  admitted  the  broadcaster  had  relied  too  heavily  on  reality  TV  shows  such  as  the  poor-rating  Who's  Your  Daddy.  |||    Chief  executive  Gail  Berman  said  ""in  the  case  of  this  fall  we  drifted  to  too  much  on  the  unscripted  side"".  The  series  Who's  Your  Daddy,  where  a  young  woman  tries  to  pick  her  natural  father  for  a  cash  prize  caused  outrage  from  adoption  groups  and  rated  badly.  Last  season,  Fox's  prime-time  audience  fell  by  600,000  to  5.9  million.  Ms  Berman  said:  ""I  think  the  audience  expects  loud  things  from  Fox.  Sometimes  they  work,  and  sometimes  they  don't.""  |||    Who's  Your  Daddy,  the  first  episode  of  which  was  shown  on  3  January,  pulled  in  a  disappointing  audience  of  6.3  million,  according  to  the  Nielsen  ratings  system.  Five  other  episodes  of  the  show  had  also  been  filmed  will  be  dropped  from  Fox's  schedules,  Ms  Berman  said.  She  was  predicting  a  drop  in  ratings  even  for  some  of  the  network's  established  reality  shows,  such  as  American  Idol,  which  is  due  to  start  its  fourth  series  this  week.  Fox  had  unveiled  a  new  strategy  last  year  promising  to  launch  new  shows  every  season,  including  the  traditionally  quiet  summer  season.  Though  that  had  met  with  a  poor  reception,  Ms  Berman  said  ""there's  no  question  that  the  audience,  in  our  mind,  is  ready,  willing  and  able  to  accept  new  programming  in  the  summer"".  Fox  has  changed  this  plan,  launching  new  shows  in  May  instead  of  June.  One  of  the  new  shows  will  be  the  animated  series  American  Dad,  made  by  Seth  MacFarlane,  the  creator  of  Family  Guy.  That  series,  after  becoming  a  hit  on  DVD,  is  also  set  to  return  with  new  episodes. "

3,"Hantuchova  in  Dubai  last  eight  |||    Daniela  Hantuchova  moved  into  the  quarter-finals  of  the  Dubai  Open,  after  beating  Elene  Likhotseva  of  Russia  7-5  6-4,  and  now  faces  Serena  Williams.  |||    Australian  Open  champion  Williams  survived  an  early  scare  to  beat  Russia's  Elena  Bovina  1-6  6-1  6-4.  World  number  one  Lindsay  Davenport  and  Anastasia  Myskina  also  progressed.  Davenport  defeated  China's  Jie  Zheng  6-2  7-5,  while  French  Open  champion  Myskina  sailed  through  after  her  opponent  Marion  Bartoli  retired  hurt.  American  Davenport  will  now  face  fellow  former  Wimbledon  champion,  Conchita  Martinez  of  Spain,  who  ousted  seventh-seeded  Nathalie  Dechy  of  France  6-1  6-2.  Myskina  will  face  eighth-seed  Patty  Schnyder  from  Switzerland,  who  defeated  China's  Li  Na  6-3  7-6  (10-8).  The  other  quarter  final  pits  wild  card  Sania  Mirza  of  India  against  Jelena  Jankovic  of  Serbia  and  Montenegro,  who  both  won  on  Tuesday.  |||    Before  her  meeting  with  Martinez,  Davenport  believes  there  is  some  room  for  improvement  in  her  game.  ""I  started  well  and  finished  well,  but  played  some  so-so  games  in  the  middle,""  she  said.  Williams  was  also  far  from  content.  ""I  don't  know  what  I  was  doing  there,""  she  said.  ""It  was  really  windy  and  I  hadn't  played  in  the  wind.  All  my  shots  were  going  out  of  here.""  But  Hantuchova  is  in  upbeat  mood  ahead  of  her  clash  with  the  younger  Williams  sister,  who  was  handed  a  first-round  bye.  ""I  feel  I  have  an  advantage  (over  Serena)  because  I  have  already  played  two  matches  on  these  courts,""  she  said.  ""It  is  a  difficult  court  to  play  on.  Very  fast  and  sometimes  you  feel  you  have  no  control  over  the  ball."" "

1,"Bangkok  film  festival  battles  on  |||    Organisers  of  the  third  Bangkok  International  Film  Festival  have  been  determined  to  carry  on  with  this  year's  event  despite  the  ravages  of  the  Asian  tsunami  disaster.  |||    The  festivities  have  been  scaled  down,  red  carpets  have  been  mothballed  and  profits  from  ticket  sales  are  being  donated  to  the  tsunami  relief  fund.  Apart  from  this,  however,  the  festival  has  continued  as  originally  planned.  ""When  the  disaster  happened,  we  naturally  asked  ourselves  if  we  should  cancel,""  said  the  festival's  executive  director,  Craig  Prater.  ""The  decision  was  made  that  we  would  continue,  but  that  the  focus  would  change.  |||    ""Our  premieres  became  fundraisers,  the  opening  night  was  visibly  toned  down  and  10%  of  every  ticket  sold  goes  to  the  disaster  fund,""  he  continued.  ""But  we  feel  like  we've  turned  a  page.  We've  acknowledged  our  position,  and  now  it's  business  as  usual.""  |||    Mr  Prater's  sentiments  were  echoed  by  Christine  Rush,  director  of  the  festival's  sister  event,  the  Bangkok  Film  Market.  ""We  have  been  careful  to  be  respectful  of  the  Thai  nation's  recovery  from  this  terrible  disaster,""  she  said.  |||    ""However,  the  nation's  recovery  very  much  depends  upon  it  continuing  its  economic  life.  ""We  are  encouraging  attendees  to  keep  the  victims  in  mind  and  aggressively  support  the  aid  organisations  helping  out,""  she  added.  Given  the  conspicuously  low  audience  figures,  that  support  may  be  more  symbolic  than  significant.  However,  poor  ticket  sales  have  less  to  do  with  any  fallout  from  the  disaster  and  more  to  do  with  administrative  and  promotional  difficulties.  |||    The  eclectic  programme  contains  a  wide  range  of  titles,  including  such  Oscar  hopefuls  as  Ray  Charles  biopic  Ray  and  Mike  Leigh's  abortion  drama  Vera  Drake.  That  said,  the  absence  of  Thai  subtitles  on  most  film  prints  might  have  proved  offputting  to  local  cinemagoers.  |||    On  a  more  positive  note,  the  celebrity  guests  attending  the  event  have  generated  huge  media  interest  in  this  busy  capital  city.  Problems  securing  air  transport,  the  clash  with  last  Sunday's  Golden  Globes  ceremony  in  Los  Angeles  and  other  factors  have  forced  some  big  names  to  cancel.  |||    But  the  festival  has  still  attracted  such  Hollywood  directors  as  Oliver  Stone  and  Joel  Schumacher,  alongside  such  screen  stars  as  Michael  Douglas,  Jeremy  Irons  and  Jean-Claude  Van  Damme.  Irons,  whose  film  Being  Julia  is  in  competition  for  the  festival's  Golden  Kinnaree  awards,  said  he  had  wondered  whether  he  should  attend  after  December's  catastrophe.  ""I  questioned  whether  I  should  come  when  such  a  tragedy  had  happened,""  the  British  actor  said.  ""I  thought  it  might  be  in  rather  bad  taste.  But  then  I  spoke  to  the  organisers  and  I  was  encouraged  to  let  life  go  on.  ""Now  I've  come  here  I'm  very  glad.  What  impresses  me  about  Thai  culture  is  they  get  over  these  things  far  quicker  than  we  do  in  the  West,""  he  continued.  ""Basically  I  was  invited  here  by  Thailand.  If  they  still  want  you  to  come,  you  should.""  |||    Now  in  its  third  year,  Bangkok  is  a  relatively  recent  addition  to  the  hectic  film  festival  calendar.  And  while  it  has  yet  to  attain  the  stature  of  more  established  events  held  in  Hong  Kong,  Tokyo  and  Pusan  in  South  Korea,  Mr  Prater  predicts  it  will  soon  become  their  equal.  ""It's  grown  awfully  fast  in  three  years  -  maybe  too  fast,""  he  concedes.  ""We've  had  some  bumps  in  the  road,  but  that's  only  because  the  festival  is  still  a  baby.  ""I  have  no  doubt  in  my  mind  that  in  five  years,  this  will  be  the  top  Asian  film  festival  in  the  world.""  The  Golden  Kinnarees  will  be  awarded  on  Friday.  The  festival  itself  runs  until  24  January. "

The  FCC  was  looking  into  50  shows,  including  those  by  ""shock  jock""  Howard  Stern  and  two  New  York  DJs.  Stern  recently  announced  he  was  leaving  Viacom  while  the  two  DJs  were  sacked  after  their  show  featured  a  couple  purporting  to  have  sex  in  a  church.  After  the  church  incident  two  years  ago  Viacom  agreed  to  install  audio  delay  equipment  at  its  radio  stations  that  broadcast  live  programming.  |||    It  also  agreed  to  train  its  broadcasters  and  employees  about  indecency  laws.  The  agreement  cancels  investigations  into  about  50  radio  and  television  shows,  said  Richard  Diamond,  FCC  deputy  secretary  of  communications.  The  shows  were  broadcast  by  Viacom-owned  stations  across  the  United  States.  Viacom  has  five  days  to  pay  the  $3.5m  fine,  according  to  the  agreement.  The  payment  is  not  related  to  the  FCC's  $550,000  (£293,000)  fine  levied  against  Viacom  after  the  exposure  of  singer  Janet  Jackson's  breast  during  the  CBS  Super  Bowl  halftime  show  in  January.  Viacom  is  contesting  that  fine.  It  is  not  the  first  time  that  Viacom  has  paid  out  over  indecency  charges.  Infinity  Broadcasting,  which  is  owned  by  Viacom,  paid  cumulative  fines  totalling  $1.7m  (£907,000)  in  1995  to  settle  FCC  violations  by  Stern. "

The  paper  added  that  most  of  the  taxes  claimed  are  linked  to  the  company's  export  activity.  Gazprom,  the  biggest  gas  company  in  the  world,  took  over  nuclear  fuel  giant  Atomstroieksport  in  October  2004.  The  main  project  of  Atomstroieksport  is  the  building  of  a  nuclear  plant  in  Iran,  which  has  been  a  source  of  tension  between  Russia  and  the  US.  |||    Gazprom  is  one  of  the  key  players  in  the  complex  Russian  energy  market,  where  the  government  of  Vladimir  Putin  has  made  moves  to  regain  state  influence  over  the  sector.  Gazprom  is  set  to  merge  with  state  oil  firm  Rosneft,  the  company  that  eventually  acquired  Yuganskneftegas,  the  main  unit  of  embattled  oil  giant  Yukos.  Claims  for  back-taxes  was  a  tool  used  against  Yukos,  and  led  to  the  enforced  sale  Yuganskneftegas.  Some  analysts  fear  the  Kremlin  will  continue  to  use  these  sort  of  moves  to  boost  the  efforts  of  the  state  to  regain  control  over  strategically  important  sectors  such  as  oil.

2,"Brown  ally  rejects  Budget  spree  |||    Chancellor  Gordon  Brown's  closest  ally  has  denied  suggestions  there  will  be  a  Budget  giveaway  on  16  March.  |||    Ed  Balls,  ex-chief  economic  adviser  to  the  Treasury,  said  there  would  be  no  spending  spree  before  polling  day.  But  Mr  Balls,  a  prospective  Labour  MP,  said  he  was  confident  the  chancellor  would  meet  his  fiscal  rules.  He  was  speaking  as  Sir  Digby  Jones,  CBI  director  general,  warned  Mr  Brown  not  to  be  tempted  to  use  any  extra  cash  on  pre-election  bribes.  |||    Mr  Balls,  who  stepped  down  from  his  Treasury  post  to  stand  as  a  Labour  candidate  in  the  election,  had  suggested  that  Mr  Brown  would  meet  his  golden  economic  rule  -  ""with  a  margin  to  spare"".  He  said  he  hoped  more  would  be  done  to  build  on  current  tax  credit  rules.  |||    He  also  stressed  rise  in  interest  rates  ahead  of  an  expected  May  election  would  not  affect  the  Labour  Party's  chances  of  winning.  Expectations  of  a  rate  rise  have  gathered  pace  after  figures  showed  house  prices  are  still  rising.  Consumer  borrowing  rose  at  a  near-record  pace  in  January.  ""If  the  MPC  (the  Bank  of  England's  Monetary  Policy  Committee)  were  to  judge  that  a  rate  rise  was  justified  before  the  election  because  of  the  strength  of  the  economy  -  and  I'm  not  predicting  that  they  will  -  I  do  not  believe  that  this  will  be  a  big  election  issue  in  Britain  for  Labour,""  he  told  a  Parliamentary  lunch.  ""This  is  a  big  change  in  our  political  culture.""  |||    During  an  interview  with  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme,  Mr  Balls  said  he  was  sure  Mr  Brown's  Budget  would  not  put  at  risk  the  stability  of  the  economy.  ""I  don't  think  we'll  see  a  pre-election  spending  spree  -  we  certainly  did  not  see  that  before  2001,""  he  said.  |||    His  assurances  came  after  Sir  Digby  Jones  said  stability  was  all  important  and  any  extra  cash  should  be  spent  on  improving  workers'  skills.  His  message  to  the  chancellor  was:  ""Please  don't  give  it  away  in  any  form  of  electioneering.""  Sir  Digby  added:  ""I  don't  think  he  will.  I  have  to  say  he  has  been  a  prudent  chancellor  right  the  way  through.  Stability  is  the  key  word  -  British  business  needs  boring  stability  more  than  anything.  ""We  would  say  to  him  'don't  increase  your  public  spending,  don't  give  it  away.  But  if  you  are  going  to  anywhere,  just  add  something  to  the  competitiveness  of  Britain,  put  it  into  skilling  our  people'.  ""That  would  be  a  good  way  to  spend  any  excess.""  |||    Mr  Balls  refused  to  say  whether  Mr  Brown  would  remain  as  chancellor  after  the  election,  amid  speculation  he  will  be  offered  the  job  of  Foreign  Secretary.  ""I  think  that  Gordon  Brown  wants  to  be  part  of  the  successful  Labour  government  which  delivers  in  the  third  term  for  the  priorities  of  the  people  and  sees  off  a  Conservative  Party  that  will  take  Britain  backwards,""  Mr  Balls  told  Today.  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  has  yet  to  name  the  date  of  the  election,  but  most  pundits  are  betting  on  5  May. "

1,"Disputed  Nirvana  box  set  on  sale  |||    A  box  set  featuring  68  unreleased  Nirvana  tracks  has  gone  on  sale  in  the  US,  after  years  of  legal  wrangles.  |||    With  the  Lights  Out  was  intended  to  be  released  in  2001,  to  mark  the  10th  anniversary  of  the  album  Nevermind.  It  was  blocked  by  Courtney  Love,  the  widow  of  Nirvana  frontman  Kurt  Cobain,  who  did  not  want  unreleased  song  You  Know  You're  Right  on  the  box  set.  The  dispute  between  Love  and  surviving  band  members  Krist  Novoselic  and  drummer  Dave  Grohl  was  settled  in  2002.  Work  began  on  the  box  set  in  1998,  but  legal  battles  put  the  project  on  hold.  The  legal  fight  centred  on  a  studio  recording  of  the  unreleased  track  You  Know  You're  Right,  regarded  by  fans  as  one  of  the  unreleased  gems  of  Nirvana.  The  set,  released  on  Tuesday,  features  three  CDs  and  a  DVD  of  rare  performance  and  rehearsal  footage.  The  DVD  also  includes  the  first  performance  of  Smells  Like  Teen  Spirit,  the  track  that  launched  Nirvana  on  to  the  international  stage  in  1991.  ""The  band  wasn't  always  pretty,  or  always  in  tune.  This  is  not  Nirvana  unplugged.  It's  Nirvana  unedited,""  said  Cobain  biographer  Charles  Cross.  The  band's  development  ended  tragically  when  songwriter  Kurt  Cobain  committed  suicide  in  April  1994. "

2,"Howard  taunts  Blair  over  splits  |||    Tony  Blair's  feud  with  Gordon  Brown  is  damaging  the  way  the  UK  is  governed,  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  has  claimed  in  a  heated  prime  minister's  questions.  |||    Mr  Howard  asked:  ""How  can  they  fight  crime  when  they  are  fighting  each  other?""  That  question  was  later  unveiled  as  the  headline  for  new  Tory  campaign  posters.  But  Mr  Blair  dismissed  the  talk  of  splits  and  said  people's  priorities  at  the  next  elections  would  be  on  the  economic  successes  achieved  by  Labour.  ""He  can  stick  up  whatever  he  likes  on  billboards  about  something  in  a  book  but  what  the  public  will  concentrate  on  are  the  low  mortgages,  low  inflation,  low  unemployment  that  we  delivered  and  that  he  failed  to,""  he  said.  The  chancellor  is  currently  on  a  high-profile  tour  of  Africa  to  highlight  new  anti-poverty  plans.  But  before  doing  so,  he  insisted  he  still  trusted  Mr  Blair,  despite  claims  to  the  contrary  in  a  new  book.  |||    Brown's  Britain,  by  Robert  Peston,  says  there  is  mutual  animosity  between  the  two  men.  It  claims  Mr  Blair  said  in  November  2003  he  would  stand  down  as  prime  minister  before  the  next  election.  But  he  went  back  on  his  pledge  after  support  from  Cabinet  allies  and  suspicion  that  Mr  Brown  was  manoeuvring  against  him,  it  says.  |||    Mr  Peston's  book  claimed  that  Mr  Brown  told  Mr  Blair:  ""There  is  nothing  you  could  ever  say  to  me  now  that  I  could  ever  believe.""  Mr  Blair  directly  denied  that  quote  on  Wednesday.  He  again  insisted  there  could  be  no  deals  about  the  premiership  but  twice  declined  directly  to  say  whether  or  not  he  had  offered  to  quit.  |||    The  Tory  leader  countered  that  such  agreements  had  been  struck  twice  at  dinners  with  the  chancellor.  He  declared:  ""He  is  the  deals  on  meals  prime  minister.  No  wonder  the  chancellor  is  not  a  happy  eater.""  He  continued:  ""How  can  there  be  discipline  in  schools  when  there  is  no  discipline  in  government,  how  can  they  clean  up  our  hospitals  when  they  don't  clean  up  their  act?""  Mr  Blair  said  he  would  not  respond  to  ""tittle  tattle  in  books""  and  promised  to  hail  Labour's  record  on  the  economy,  waiting  lists  and  law  and  order  ""from  now  until  polling  day"".  Later  at  their  poster  launch  Tory  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  said  his  party  would  exploit  opportunities  to  show  how  ""juvenile""  the  prime  minister  and  chancellor  were.  |||    Labour  staged  a  show  of  unity  at  its  own  poster  launch  on  Tuesday,  where  Mr  Brown  was  joined  by  Alan  Milburn,  who  Mr  Blair  controversially  put  in  charge  of  election  planning  in  place  of  the  chancellor.  But  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  told  BBC  News:  ""The  government  is  clearly  split  at  the  top.  This  kind  of  cosmetic  exercise  does  not  persuade  anybody.""  Later  this  week  Mr  Blair  is  expected  to  outline  the  direction  of  his  party's  next  election  manifesto.  The  prime  minister  and  chancellor  faced  backbench  discontent  at  Monday's  meeting  of  the  Parliamentary  Labour  Party  over  claims  made  Mr  Peston's  book. "

0,"US  company  admits  Benin  bribery  |||    A  US  defence  and  telecommunications  company  has  agreed  to  pay  $28.5m  after  admitting  bribery  in  the  West  African  state  of  Benin.  |||    The  Titan  corporation  was  accused  of  funnelling  more  than  $2m  into  the  2001  re-election  campaign  of  President  Mathieu  Kerekou.  At  the  time,  Titan  was  trying  to  get  a  higher  price  for  a  telecommunications  project  in  Benin.  There  is  no  suggestion  that  Mr  Kerekou  was  himself  aware  of  any  wrongdoing.  Titan,  a  California-based  company,  pleaded  guilty  to  falsifying  its  accounts  and  violating  US  anti-bribery  laws.  It  agreed  to  pay  $13m  in  criminal  penalties,  as  well  as  $15.5m  to  settle  a  civil  lawsuit  brought  by  the  US  financial  watchdog,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC).  |||    The  SEC  had  accused  Titan  of  illegally  paying  $2.1m  to  an  unnamed  agent  in  Benin  claiming  ties  with  President  Kerekou.  Some  of  the  money  was  used  to  pay  for  T-shirts  with  campaign  slogans  on  them  ahead  of  the  2001  election.  Shortly  after  the  poll,  which  Mr  Kerekou  won,  Benin  officials  agreed  to  quadruple  Titan's  management  fee.  Prosecuting  attorney  Carol  Lam  said:  ""All  US  companies  should  take  note  that  attempting  to  bribe  foreign  officials  is  criminal  conduct  and  will  be  appropriately  prosecuted.""  The  company  says  it  no  longer  tolerates  such  practices.  Under  the  US  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act,  it  is  a  crime  for  American  firms  to  bribe  foreign  officials. "

2,"New  foot  and  mouth  action  urged  |||    A  senior  Tory  MP  has  criticised  agriculture  department  Defra's  ""lackadaisical""  approach  to  planning  for  a  future  foot  and  mouth  outbreak.  |||    Public  accounts  committee  chairman  Edward  Leigh  was  giving  his  reaction  to  a  report  by  a  government  watchdog  on  lessons  to  be  learnt  from  the  crisis.  The  National  Audit  Office  said  Defra  had  improved  its  capacity  to  deal  with  future  livestock  disease  outbreaks.  But  Mr  Leigh  said  the  department  was  ""dragging  its  heels"".  |||    That  comment  referred  to  the  setting  up  of  a  scheme  to  share  any  future  compensation  costs  with  industry.  He  also  said  Defra  had  been  ""dreadfully  slow""  in  paying  some  of  its  bills  dating  from  the  foot  and  mouth  crisis.  |||    The  outbreak,  which  began  in  2001,  led  to  the  slaughter  of  6.5  million  animals,  devastated  many  farms  and  rural  businesses,  and  is  estimated  to  have  cost  the  UK  up  to  £8bn.  ""Four  years  after  the  outbreak,  Defra  is  yet  to  begin  its  planned  review  of  some  of  its  contractors'  costs,  and  £40m  of  invoices  remain  unpaid,""  Mr  Leigh  said.  Mr  Leigh  also  pointed  out  that  the  introduction  of  an  IT  system  to  help  control  future  outbreaks  had  been  delayed.  In  November  it  emerged  European  Commission  compensation  amounted  to  just  over  a  third  of  the  money  the  UK  government  had  hoped  to  get  as  reimbursement  for  the  billions  lost  through  the  foot  and  mouth  crisis.  |||    Ministers  had  hoped  to  get  £900m  from  the  European  Union  Vet  Fund  to  help  with  animal  slaughter  and  other  costs  but  in  the  end  was  granted  £349m.  That  was  because  the  UK  had  valued  the  culled  animals  at  between  ""two  and  three  times""  the  commission's  assessment  of  their  likely  market  value.  National  Audit  Office  chief  Sir  John  Bourn  said  a  new  compensation  scheme  was  now  being  looked  at.  On  the  issue  of  the  unpaid  invoices,  Sir  John  said  Defra  had  paid  97%  of  the  £1.3bn  submitted  by  contractors  since  2001,  ""but  has  not  agreed  a  final  settlement  with  57  contractors  pending  the  results  of  its  investigations"".  |||    Mr  Leigh  said  being  ""better  prepared""  would  also  help  avoid  the  need  for  ""mass  funeral  pyres  which  provided  an  unsettling  images  of  the  2001  outbreak"".  A  Defra  spokesman  said:  ""We  welcome  the  report.  It  acknowledges  the  progress  the  department  has  made  since  2001  -  particularly  on  contingency  planning  and  our  improved  capacity  and  preparedness  for  combating  another  major  disease  outbreak.  ""However,  the  department  is  aware  that  there  are  some  areas  requiring  further  work  and  we  are  working  to  resolve  them  as  soon  as  is  practicable."" "

EastEnders  and  Coronation  Street  were  overlooked  in  the  soap  category,  but  Doctors  and  Family  Affairs  gained  nods.  The  festival,  which  honours  the  best  TV  from  around  the  globe,  will  take  place  in  Lucerne,  Switzerland  from  3-8  May.  |||    Little  Britain,  which  is  now  in  its  second  series,  faces  competition  from  BBC  Two's  The  Catherine  Tate  Show  and  Sacha  Baron  Cohen's  creations  Borat  and  Bruno.

Lenny  Henry,  who  won  a  Golden  Rose  for  his  In  Pieces  series  in  2001,  picks  up  another  nomination  for  his  recent  BBC  show.  British  television  music  shows  have  picked  up  six  nominations,  with  BBC  Three's  Flashmob  -  The  Opera  up  against  the  UK  Music  Hall  of  Fame  series,  which  was  screened  on  Channel  4.  British  television  has  performed  very  well  in  the  arts  and  specials  category,  gaining  a  total  of  11  nominations.  The  BBC  leads  the  way  with  its  programmes  on  The  Sound  of  Music,  Agatha  Christie  and  Rolf  On  Art  -  The  Big  Event  -  which  saw  Harris  lead  an  effort  to  produce  a  life-size  painting  in  London's  Trafalgar  Square.  |||    British  shows  -  which  picked  up  a  total  of  48  nominations  -  will  have  to  overcome  competition  from  a  host  of  other  countries,  including  the  US,  Canada,  Japan  and  across  Europe.  UK  nominee  TV  Diaries,  which  is  shown  around  the  world,  is  owned  by  a  British  company  but  has  yet  to  be  screened  in  this  country.

Meighan  grew  up  in  Leicester  with  Kasabian  songwriter/guitarist  Sergio  Pizzorno  and  bassist  Chris  Edwards,  a  trio  which  began  making  music  from  the  age  of  17.  |||    They  enlisted  guitarist  and  keyboard  player  Christopher  Karloff  after  spotting  him  in  a  pub.  ""We  saw  his  long  sideburns  and  thought  'hey,  he  looks  the  part,  we'll  ask  him,'""  said  Meighan.  Inspired  by  Britpop  and  a  mutual  love  of  hardcore,  an  early  1990s  genre  that  fused  house  music  with  hip  hop  beats  and  a  dark  sensibility,  they  added  an  electronic  element  to  the  traditional  guitar  sound.  ""We  got  a  computer  and  we  cut  rock'n'roll  up,  because  there's  no  point  in  going  back  to  how  it  was,""  said  Meighan.  ""It's  all  about  new  ideas  and  creativity.""  |||    The  band's  original  approach  is  reflected  in  its  name,  inspired  by  Linda  Kasabian  -  the  getaway  driver  of  US  serial  killer  Charles  Manson.  Coincidentally  it  is  also  the  Armenian  term  for  ""butcher"".  Kasabian  moved  into  a  remote  farmhouse  in  Rutland  to  record  their  debut  album,  benefiting  from  its  isolation  but  also  managing  to  sneak  in  a  few  parties  while  they  were  there.  Signed  to  the  RCA  record  label,  Kasabian  tested  the  water  with  two  singles,  Club  Foot  and  LSF,  which  reached  numbers  19  and  10  in  the  UK  singles  chart  respectively.  |||    They  built  up  their  following  on  the  summer  festival  circuit,  opening  both  Glastonbury  and  T  in  the  Park,  and  at  a  series  of  ""guerilla  gigs""  at  unusual  venues  including  Half  Time  Orange,  a  pub  next  to  Leicester  City  football  club's  headquarters.  Kasabian's  self-titled  album  was  released  last  September  to  widespread  critical  acclaim,  its  indie  dance  stance  drawing  comparisons  to  The  Stone  Roses,  Primal  Scream  and  The  Happy  Mondays.  |||    Regarding  it  as  ""both  a  fiery  assertion  of  rock  'n'  roll  ethics  and  proof  that  a  siege  mentality  is  alive  and  well  in  the  badlands  of  Rutland  Water"",  the  NME's  praise  was  typical  of  the  album's  reception.  As  2004  progressed  Kasabian  would  score  a  further  two  hits  -  Processed  Beats  and  Cutt  Off  -  and  embark  upon  a  well-received  UK  tour.  ""We  take  our  music  seriously,  definitely,  but  we  want  to  have  fun  with  it,""  said  Pizzorno.  ""This  is  not  a  job  to  us,""  added  Meighan.  ""This  is  the  best  life  we  could  ever  have.  This  is  what  it's  all  about  and  without  it  we'd  be  lost  souls.  But  music  needs  us  as  well."" "

2,"Blair  and  Blunkett  Sheffield  trip  |||    Tony  Blair  is  to  join  Home  Secretary  David  Blunkett  in  a  visit  to  Sheffield  on  Thursday.  |||    Mr  Blunkett's  conduct  is  being  looked  at  to  establish  whether  he  abused  his  position  in  relation  to  his  ex-lover.  The  Parliamentary  standards  watchdog  is  looking  at  his  decision  to  give  Kimberly  Quinn  free  rail  tickets.  He  is  also  being  investigated  over  the  visa  application  of  Mrs  Quinn's  ex-nanny.  The  visit  to  Sheffield  will  be  seen  as  a  show  of  unity  by  Mr  Blair.  |||    On  Wednesday  during  Prime  Minister's  Questions,  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  went  on  the  offensive  over  comments  Mr  Blunkett  is  alleged  to  have  made  in  a  new  biography.  He  is  understood  to  have  made  a  series  of  criticisms  about  his  Cabinet  colleagues  from  the  prime  minister  down.  Mr  Howard  said  Mr  Blunkett  had  complained  he  had  inherited  a  ""giant  mess""  when  he  took  over  at  the  Home  Office  from  Jack  Straw,  now  foreign  secretary.  The  Tory  leader  went  on:  ""He  doesn't  stop  there:  he  thinks  the  culture  secretary's  weak;  he  thinks  the  trade  secretary  doesn't  think  strategically  and  he  thinks  the  education  secretary  hasn't  developed  as  expected.  ""He  says  the  prime  minister  doesn't  like  being  told  the  truth  and  the  chancellor  -  no  doubt  the  prime  minister  will  agree  with  this  -  is  a  bully.""  Mr  Blair  retorted  voters  remembered  the  record  of  a  government  and  no  comments  by  politicians.  |||    The  home  secretary  has  already  admitted  he  was  wrong  to  give  the  two  first  class  tickets,  given  to  him  as  an  MP,  to  Mrs  Quinn  and  has  since  paid  the  £180  back.  He  has  apologised  for  ""a  genuine  mistake""  and  says  he  will  write  to  the  watchdog  to  answer  further  questions.  The  rail  tickets  are  meant  to  help  MPs'  spouses  get  between  Westminster  and  their  constituencies.  After  his  inquiry,  Parliamentary  watchdog  Sir  Philip  Mawer  will  report  to  the  Commons  Standards  and  Privileges  Committee,  the  group  of  MPs  who  will  recommend  to  the  full  House  of  Commons  what  action  -  if  any  -  should  be  taken  against  Mr  Blunkett.  |||    The  separate  inquiry  by  ex-senior  civil  servant  Sir  Alan  Budd  is  investigating  whether  the  home  secretary  helped  fast-track  a  bid  by  Mrs  Quinn's  nanny,  Leoncia  Casalme,  to  stay  in  the  UK.  Last  week,  Mr  Blunkett  won  the  first  round  of  a  High  Court  battle  with  Mrs  Quinn  for  access  to  her  son.  Mr  Blunkett  declined  to  comment  about  his  own  position,  saying  the  inquiry  was  under  way  and  the  High  Court  had  stressed  his  right  to  privacy  did  not  affect  his  job  in  improving  security  and  stability.  Downing  Street  has  stressed  Mr  Blair's  support  for  the  home  secretary. "

0,"Nasdaq  planning  $100m-share  sale  |||    The  owner  of  the  technology-dominated  Nasdaq  stock  index  plans  to  sell  shares  to  the  public  and  list  itself  on  the  market  it  operates.  |||    According  to  a  registration  document  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  Nasdaq  Stock  Market  plans  to  raise  $100m  (£52m)  from  the  sale.  Some  observers  see  this  as  another  step  closer  to  a  full  public  listing.  However  Nasdaq,  an  icon  of  the  1990s  technology  boom,  recently  poured  cold  water  on  those  suggestions.  |||    The  company  first  sold  shares  in  private  placements  during  2000  and  2001.  It  technically  went  public  in  2002  when  the  stock  started  trading  on  the  OTC  Bulletin  Board,  which  lists  equities  that  trade  only  occasionally.  Nasdaq  will  not  make  money  from  the  sale,  only  investors  who  bought  shares  in  the  private  placings,  the  filing  documents  said.  The  Nasdaq  is  made  up  shares  in  technology  firms  and  other  companies  with  high  growth  potential.  It  was  the  most  potent  symbol  of  the  1990s  internet  and  telecoms  boom,  nose-diving  after  the  bubble  burst.  A  recovery  in  the  fortunes  of  tech  giants  such  as  Intel,  and  dot.com  survivors  such  as  Amazon  has  helped  revive  its  fortunes. "

0,"Japanese  growth  grinds  to  a  halt  |||    Growth  in  Japan  evaporated  in  the  three  months  to  September,  sparking  renewed  concern  about  an  economy  not  long  out  of  a  decade-long  trough.  |||    Output  in  the  period  grew  just  0.1%,  an  annual  rate  of  0.3%.  Exports  -  the  usual  engine  of  recovery  -  faltered,  while  domestic  demand  stayed  subdued  and  corporate  investment  also  fell  short.  The  growth  falls  well  short  of  expectations,  but  does  mark  a  sixth  straight  quarter  of  expansion.  |||    The  economy  had  stagnated  throughout  the  1990s,  experiencing  only  brief  spurts  of  expansion  amid  long  periods  in  the  doldrums.  One  result  was  deflation  -  prices  falling  rather  than  rising  -  which  made  Japanese  shoppers  cautious  and  kept  them  from  spending.  |||    The  effect  was  to  leave  the  economy  more  dependent  than  ever  on  exports  for  its  recent  recovery.  But  high  oil  prices  have  knocked  0.2%  off  the  growth  rate,  while  the  falling  dollar  means  products  shipped  to  the  US  are  becoming  relatively  more  expensive.  |||    The  performance  for  the  third  quarter  marks  a  sharp  downturn  from  earlier  in  the  year.  The  first  quarter  showed  annual  growth  of  6.3%,  with  the  second  showing  1.1%,  and  economists  had  been  predicting  as  much  as  2%  this  time  around.  ""Exports  slowed  while  capital  spending  became  weaker,""  said  Hiromichi  Shirakawa,  chief  economist  at  UBS  Securities  in  Tokyo.  ""Personal  consumption  looks  good,  but  it  was  mainly  due  to  temporary  factors  such  as  the  Olympics.  ""The  amber  light  is  flashing.""  The  government  may  now  find  it  more  difficult  to  raise  taxes,  a  policy  it  will  have  to  implement  when  the  economy  picks  up  to  help  deal  with  Japan's  massive  public  debt.

2,"Cherie  accused  of  attacking  Bush  |||    Cherie  Blair  has  been  accused  of  criticising  George  W  Bush's  policies  in  a  private  address  she  gave  during  a  United  States  lecture  tour.  |||    The  prime  minister's  wife  is  said  to  have  praised  the  Supreme  Court  for  overruling  the  White  House  on  the  legal  rights  of  Guantanamo  Bay  detainees.  The  Tories  said  she  broke  a  convention  that  British  political  figures  do  not  act  in  a  partisan  way  when  abroad.  But  Downing  Street  said  she  was  speaking  in  her  capacity  as  a  lawyer.  It  said  she  was  not  expressing  political  opinions.  Mrs  Blair's  remarks  are  said  to  have  been  made  in  a  speech  to  law  students  in  Massachusetts.  She  said  the  decision  by  the  US  Supreme  Court  to  give  legal  protection  to  two  Britons  held  at  Guantanamo  Bay  was  a  significant  victory  for  human  rights  and  the  international  rule  of  law.  She  also  described  the  US  legal  code  as  an  outdated  grandfather  clock  and  welcomed  a  decision  to  throw  out  a  law  backed  by  Mr  Bush  relating  to  sodomy  in  Texas.  |||    BBC  news  correspondent  Gary  O'Donoghue  said  Mrs  Blair  was  likely  to  face  further  calls  for  restraint,  since  the  US  election  is  imminent.  ""There  have  been  some  objections  from  people  reasonably  close  to  the  Bush  administration  about  her  making  these  comments  in  their  backyard  just  two  days  before  a  presidential  election,""  he  said.  ""Conservatives  here  too  have  made  their  feelings  clear.  ""Cherie  Booth  has  always  regarded  herself  as  having  an  independent  career.  She  has  continued  to  practise  as  a  major  human  rights  lawyer  in  the  courts.  ""It's  not  unusual  for  her  to  make  these  sorts  of  criticisms  clear  but  it  can  be  embarrassing."" "

0,"Cars  pull  down  US  retail  figures  |||    US  retail  sales  fell  0.3%  in  January,  the  biggest  monthly  decline  since  last  August,  driven  down  by  a  heavy  fall  in  car  sales.  |||    The  3.3%  fall  in  car  sales  had  been  expected,  coming  after  December's  4%  rise  in  car  sales,  fuelled  by  generous  pre-Christmas  special  offers.  Excluding  the  car  sector,  US  retail  sales  were  up  0.6%  in  January,  twice  what  some  analysts  had  been  expecting.  US  retail  spending  is  expected  to  rise  in  2005,  but  not  as  quickly  as  in  2004.  |||    Steve  Gallagher,  US  chief  economist  at  SG  Corporate  &  Investment  Banking,  said  January's  figures  were  ""decent  numbers"".  |||    ""We  are  not  seeing  the  numbers  that  we  saw  in  the  second  half  of  2004,  but  they  are  still  pretty  healthy,""  he  added.  Sales  at  appliance  and  electronic  stores  were  down  0.6%  in  January,  while  sales  at  hardware  stores  dropped  by  0.3%  and  furniture  store  sales  dipped  0.1%.  Sales  at  clothing  and  clothing  accessory  stores  jumped  1.8%,  while  sales  at  general  merchandise  stores,  a  category  that  includes  department  stores,  rose  by  0.9%.  These  strong  gains  were  in  part  put  down  to  consumers  spending  gift  vouchers  they  had  been  given  for  Christmas.  |||    Sales  at  restaurants,  bars  and  coffee  houses  rose  by  0.3%,  while  grocery  store  sales  were  up  0.5%.  In  December,  overall  retail  sales  rose  by  1.1%.  Excluding  the  car  sector,  sales  rose  by  just  0.3%.  Parul  Jain,  deputy  chief  economist  at  Nomura  Securities  International,  said  consumer  spending  would  continue  to  rise  in  2005,  only  at  a  slower  rate  of  growth  than  in  2004.  ""Consumers  continue  to  retain  their  strength  in  the  first  quarter,""  he  said.  Van  Rourke,  a  bond  strategist  at  Popular  Securities,  agreed  that  the  latest  retail  sales  figures  were  ""slightly  stronger  than  expected"". "

1,"France  set  for  new  Da  Vinci  novel  |||    French  booksellers  are  braced  for  a  rush  of  interest  after  another  book  from  the  author  of  The  Da  Vinci  Code  is  translated  into  French.  |||    Angels  and  Demons,  by  US  author  Dan  Brown,  will  go  on  sale  on  Wednesday.  The  Da  Vinci  Code  is  set  in  Paris  -  including  the  Louvre  -  and  has  sold  around  one  million  copies  in  France.  The  main  character,  Robert  Langdon,  also  appears  in  Angels  and  Demons.  The  Da  Vinci  Code  is  being  made  into  a  film  starring  Tom  Hanks.  Angels  and  Demons  was  written  before  The  Da  Vinci  Code,  which  has  sold  more  than  20  million  copies  worldwide,  and  been  translated  into  more  than  40  languages,  since  it  was  released  in  2003.  Angels  and  Demons  is  set  mainly  in  Rome  as  symbologist  Robert  Langdon  follows  a  400-year-old  trail  to  try  to  uncover  a  plot  by  an  ancient  brotherhood,  The  Illuminati,  to  blow  up  the  Vatican.  |||    The  novel  deals  with  moral  issues  such  as  the  debate  between  science  and  religion  and  also  seeks  to  uncover  some  of  the  mysteries  surrounding  the  Pope.  On  his  website,  Brown  wrote:  ""I  think  the  reason  Angels  and  Demons  is  raising  eyebrows  right  now  is  that  it  opens  some  Vatican  closets  most  people  don't  even  know  exist.  ""But  I  think  most  people  understand  that  an  organisation  as  old  and  powerful  as  the  Vatican  could  not  possibly  have  risen  to  power  without  acquiring  a  few  skeletons  in  their  closets.""  Such  is  the  success  of  The  Da  Vinci  Code  in  France,  special  tours  have  been  organised  to  trace  Langdon's  footsteps,  including  the  the  Louvre  museum  and  the  Saint  Sulpice  Church.  The  Louvre  has  also  given  permission  for  parts  of  the  film  version  to  be  shot  in  the  museum.  The  film,  to  be  directed  by  A  Beautiful  Mind's  Ron  Howard,  is  due  to  start  filming  at  the  Paris  museum  in  May  and  stars  Hanks  alongside  French  actress  Audrey  Tautou. "

0,"Singapore  growth  at  8.1%  in  2004  |||    Singapore's  economy  grew  by  8.1%  in  2004,  its  best  performance  since  2000,  figures  from  the  trade  ministry  show.  |||    The  advance,  the  second-fastest  in  Asia  after  China,  was  led  by  growth  of  13.1%  in  the  key  manufacturing  sector.  However,  a  slower-than-expected  fourth  quarter  points  to  more  modest  growth  for  the  trade-driven  economy  in  2005  as  global  technology  demand  falls  back.  Slowdowns  in  the  US  and  China  could  hit  electronics  exports,  while  the  tsunami  disaster  may  effect  the  service  sector.  |||    Economic  growth  is  set  to  halve  in  Singapore  this  year  to  between  3%  and  5%.  In  the  fourth  quarter,  the  city  state's  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  rose  at  an  annual  rate  of  2.4%.  That  was  up  from  the  third  quarter,  when  it  fell  3.0%,  but  was  well  below  analyst  forecasts.  ""I  am  surprised  at  the  weak  fourth  quarter  number.  The  main  drag  came  from  electronics,""  said  Lian  Chia  Liang,  economist  at  JP  Morgan  Chase.  Singapore's  economy  had  contracted  over  the  summer,  weighed  down  by  soaring  oil  prices.  The  economy's  poor  performance  in  the  July  to  September  period  followed  four  consecutive  quarters  of  double-digit  growth  as  Singapore  bounced  back  strongly  from  the  effects  of  the  deadly  Sars  virus  in  2003.

2,"'More  to  do'  on  adult  literacy  |||    The  government  will  only  hit  its  target  for  improving  adult  maths  and  literacy  skills  if  courses  are  made  more  attractive,  a  report  says.  |||    The  National  Audit  Office  praised  ministers  for  reaching  the  benchmark  of  750,000  adults  in  England  gaining  basic  qualifications  by  this  year.  But  a  target  of  1.5  million  more  by  2010  needed  ""creative""  ideas.  Some  26  million  adults  lack  maths  or  English  skill  levels  expected  of  school-leavers.  |||    According  to  the  report,  ""more  than  half""  the  qualifications  achieved  were  by  learners  aged  16  to  18.  These  are  defined  as  ""adults""  by  the  government  for  the  purpose  of  compiling  these  figures.  Normally  adults  are  defined  as  being  aged  over  19.  The  number  of  these  people  gaining  qualifications  was  ""rising  slowly"".  Auditor  General  Sir  John  Bourn  said:  ""Higher  levels  of  literacy  and  numeracy  will  benefit  England  both  socially  and  economically.  ""More  people  will  have  the  opportunity  to  live  richer  lives.""  In  2001,  the  government  launched  the  Get  On  scheme  -  aimed  at  reducing  illiteracy  and  innumeracy.  Sir  John  said  ""substantial  progress""  had  been  made  since,  adding  that  this  was  ""only  the  beginning"".  The  government  and  its  partners  would  ""need  to  be  creative  and  responsive"".  Some  £3.7bn  will  be  spent  on  implementing  the  programme  by  2006.  The  report  recommends  gathering  more  details  on  the  educational  needs  of  areas,  so  courses  can  be  set  to  meet  local  demand.  Existing  adult  learners  could  use  their  ""enthusiasm,  commitment  and  local  knowledge""  to  attract  other  people.  The  Department  for  Education  and  Skills  could  also  use  more  ""personalised  learning""  and  work  with  voluntary  groups,  councils  and  employers.  |||    It  should  also  assess  adult  learners'  progress  ""at  frequent  intervals"",  the  report  adds.  When  the  government  announced  it  had  reached  its  2004  target  earlier  this  month,  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  said  it  was  ""only  the  start  of  the  journey"".  An  estimated  5.2  million  adults  have  worse  literacy  than  that  expected  of  11  year  olds,  while  14.9  million  have  numeracy  skills  below  this  level.  This  is  thought  to  cost  the  UK  economy  hundreds  of  millions  of  pounds  each  year.  The  qualifications  achieved  by  those  taking  part  in  the  government's  scheme  range  up  to  GCSE  equivalents.  Get  On's  participation  target  has  been  set  at  2.25  million  by  2010,  with  an  interim  figure  of  1.5  million  by  2007.  Education  minister  Ivan  Lewis  said:  ""We  will  continue  to  use  creative  ways  of  involving  people  with  the  lowest  skill  levels  and  the  report  shows  that  our  efforts  are  gathering  pace.""  Shadow  Education  Secretary  Tim  Collins  said:  ""This  is  the  third  report  in  two  days  to  highlight  Labour's  failure  to  ensure  young  people  acquire  the  necessary  levels  of  literacy  and  numeracy  for  their  working  life.  ""Employers  and  business  leaders  have  repeatedly  voiced  concern  over  the  number  of  school-leavers  without  these  basic  skills,  but  all  the  government  have  offered  is  more  talk.""  Liberal  Democrat  education  spokesman  Phil  Willis  added:  ""Far  too  little  has  been  done  to  enable  adult  learners  to  fit  learning  into  their  busy  lives."" "

3,"Call  for  Kenteris  to  be  cleared  |||    Kostas  Kenteris'  lawyer  has  called  for  the  doping  charges  against  the  Greek  sprinter  to  be  dropped.  |||    Gregory  Ioannidis  has  submitted  new  evidence  to  a  Greek  athletics  tribunal  which  he  claims  proves  the  former  Olympic  champion  has  no  case  to  answer.  Kenteris  and  compatriot  Katerina  Thanou  were  given  provisional  suspensions  in  December  for  failing  to  take  drugs  tests  before  the  Athens  Olympics.  The  Greek  tribunal  is  expected  to  give  its  verdict  early  next  week.  Kenteris  and  Thanou  withdrew  from  the  Athens  Olympics  last  August  after  missing  drugs  tests  on  the  eve  of  the  opening  ceremony.  They  were  also  alleged  to  have  avoided  tests  in  Tel  Aviv  and  Chicago  before  the  Games.  |||    But  Ioannidis  said:  ""Everything  overwhelmingly  shows  that  the  charges  should  be  dropped.""  Ioannidis  also  said  he  has  presented  evidence  that  will  throw  a  different  light  on  the  events  leading  up  to  the  pair's  sensational  withdrawal  from  the  Athens  Games.  The  lawyer  added  that  he  has  proof  the  authorities  ""knew""  Kenteris  was  in  Germany  at  the  time  he  was  alleged  to  have  missed  a  test  in  Chicago.  Nick  Davies,  spokesman  for  athletics'  ruling  body  the  IAAF,  which  handed  out  the  provisional  bans,  said:  ""We  can't  comment  because  we  were  not  present  at  the  hearing  and  don't  know  what  was  said  behind  closed  doors.  ""We  expect  a  verdict  from  the  Greek  Athletics  Federation  before  the  end  of  February  and  will  obviously  be  making  a  statement  then.""  Kenteris  won  200m  gold  at  the  2000  Sydney  Olympics,  while  Thanou  won  silver  in  the  100m. "

2,"Tories  unveil  quango  blitz  plans  |||    Plans  to  abolish  162  quangos  have  been  unveiled  by  the  Conservatives  as  part  of  their  effort  to  show  how  government  red  tape  can  be  cut.  |||    Six  government  units  would  also  be  scrapped  under  proposals  which  the  Tories  say  would  save  more  than  £4.3bn.  Among  the  targets  are  strategic  health  authorities  and  the  new  fair  access  regulator  for  universities.  Tory  frontbencher  John  Redwood  said  Britain  needed  a  slimmer  government  and  lower  taxes  to  be  competitive.  |||    The  plans  would  abolish  regional  assemblies  and  other  regional  bodies,  such  as  boards  tackling  industrial  development  and  housing.  Their  powers  would  be  returned  to  elected  local  councils  or  national  government.  The  Tories  say  the  strategic  health  authorities  are  not  needed  as  it  is  better  that  local  people,  rather  than  officials,  run  hospitals  and  surgeries.  |||    Announcing  the  plans,  Mr  Redwood  said:  ""Mr  Blair  has  forgotten  the  interests  of  taxpayers,  and  has  broken  the  pledges  he  made.  ""Far  from  improving  public  services,  spending  taxpayers'  money  on  quangos  has  led  only  to  more  bureaucrats,  more  regulation  and  higher  taxes.""  His  party  leader,  Michael  Howard,  argued  a  change  in  direction  was  needed  to  get  a  grip  on  spending.  ""Labour  are  creating  Two  Britains:  the  Britain  of  the  forgotten  majority  and  bureaucratic  Britain,""  he  said.  ""In  the  real  world,  people  are  working  harder  just  to  stand  still.  They've  seen  their  pensions  knocked  for  six.  ""They're  being  squeezed  by  extra  taxes.  The  forgotten  majority  are  paying  the  price  of  bureaucratic  Britain.""  |||    The  government  has  announced  plans  to  cut  100,000  civil  servants  as  part  of  its  efficiency  drive.  But  Chief  Secretary  to  the  Treasury  Paul  Boateng  attacked  the  Tory  plans.  ""The  Conservatives  are  committed  to  cutting  Labour's  public  spending  plans  by  a  massive  £35  billion,""  he  said.  ""Cuts  on  this  scale  cannot  be  found  from  cutting  'bureaucracy'  but  would  require  massive  cuts  to  front-line  public  services  such  as  schools,  hospitals  and  the  police.""  The  Liberal  Democrats  have  said  they  would  cut  the  number  of  Whitehall  departments  to  make  sure  money  reaches  frontline  services. "

0,"M&S  cuts  prices  by  average  of  24%  |||    Marks  &  Spencer  has  cut  prices  in  London  and  the  regions  by  an  average  of  24%,  according  to  research  from  a  City  investment  bank.  |||    Dresdner  Kleinwort  Wasserstein  said:  ""In  spite  of  the  snow  in  the  UK,  it  still  feels  very  early  to  be  cutting  prices  of  spring  merchandise.""  Stuart  Rose,  head  of  M&S,  said  last  year  its  prices  were  too  high.  ""We  are  bringing  in  ranges  at  new  price  points  to  compete  against  mid-market  retailers  like  Next,""  said  M&S.  |||    Next  is  one  of  M&S's  biggest  competitors  and  the  move  may  force  it  to  lower  prices.  DrKW  said  the  cuts  are  either  to  clear  stock  or  could  indicate  a  longer  term  ""step  change  in  pricing  in  certain  areas""  at  M&S.  ""Either  way,  this  cannot  be  good  news  for  M&S'  margin,""  it  added.  ""We  have  brought  in  quite  a  lot  of  new  clothing  at  new  price  points  as  part  of  Stuart  Rose's  strategy  of  quality,  style  -and  price,""  said  the  M&S  spokesman.  Many  analysts  believe  February  is  proving  to  be  a  difficult  month  for  retailers  and  British  Retail  Consortium  figures,  due  in  a  few  weeks,  are  expected  to  reflect  the  tough  trading  environment.  Separately,  investment  bank  Goldman  Sachs  produced  reseach  showing  that  a  basket  of  35  M&S  goods  is  now  11%  above  the  high-street  average,  compared  with  43%  higher  last  year.  |||    It  has  been  a  strange  week  for  M&S,  which  on  Tuesday  received  a  statement  from  Philip  Green,  the  billionaire  Bhs  owner,  confirming  he  was  not  rebidding  for  the  company.  This  was  followed  the  same  day  by  Mark  Paulsmeier,  a  South  African  financier,  issuing  a  press  release  saying  his  Paulsmeier  Group  was  interested  in  M&S.  A  sudden  spike  in  M&S's  share  price  followed.  However,  an  M&S  spokesman  said  on  Sunday  it  had  no  evidence  that  Mr  Paulsmeier  had  lined  up  sufficient  finance  for  a  bid.  He  also  said  the  Takeover  Panel  and  the  UK's  financial  watchdog  the  Financial  Services  Authority  had  been  in  touch  with  M&S  at  the  beginning  of  the  week  to  find  out  what  it  knew  about  the  Paulsmeier  developments.

0,"SA  unveils  'more  for  all'  budget  |||    The  South  African  government  has  put  tax  cuts  and  increased  social  spending  at  the  centre  of  its  latest  budget.  |||    Aiming  to  both  stir  economic  growth  and  aid  the  country's  poor,  finance  minister  Trevor  Manuel  said  the  focus  of  the  2005  budget  was  ""more  for  all"".  The  tax  cuts  target  firms  and  individuals,  cutting  corporate  tax  from  30%  to  29%  and  offering  income  tax  cuts  worth  6.8bn  rand  ($1.2bn;  £910m).  Spending  on  health  and  education  will  rise  by  9.4%  and  8.1%  respectively.  Spending  on  housing  and  sanitation  will  rise  by  12%.  All  the  spending  increases  will  run  over  the  next  three  years.  |||    Unveiling  the  418bn-rand  budget  to  parliament,  Mr  Manuel  said  the  South  African  economy  had  grown  by  an  average  of  3.2%  over  the  past  four  years,  slightly  below  the  African  average  of  4%.  |||    He  predicted  that  the  South  African  economy  would  grow  by  4.3%  in  2005  and  4.2%  in  2006.  Mr  Manuel  added  that  inflation  fell  to  4.3%  in  2004  and  is  expected  to  remain  at  between  3%  and  6%  from  now  until  at  least  2008,  helped  by  interest  rates  which  are  at  their  lowest  level  in  24  years.  Given  that  both  corporate  and  personal  taxes  are  being  cut  -  under  the  new  measures,  those  earning  less  than  35,000  rand  a  year  will  be  exempt  from  income  tax  -  the  extra  22.3bn  rand  in  social  spending  will  be  partly  met  by  higher  fuel,  tobacco  and  alcohol  taxes.  |||    ""In  this  budget,  the  focus  is  on  more  for  all,  not  more  for  some,  and  not  a  hell  of  a  lot  more  for  a  few,  but  spread  across  all  of  South  Africa,""  said  Mr  Manuel.  He  said  that  the  economic  situation  was  a  ""marked  improvement""  on  the  position  at  the  end  of  apartheid,  but  acknowledged  that  more  needed  to  be  done  to  improve  the  lives  and  livelihoods  of  the  disadvantaged.  About  280,000  jobs  a  year  have  been  created  in  South  Africa  since  2000  but  unemployment  remains  high,  currently  close  to  30%.  Economist  Colen  Garrow  said  the  budget  looked  as  if  it  would  stimulate  economic  growth.  ""It's  pleasant  to  see  the  cut  in  company  taxes,  it's  a  good  incentive  for  business,""  he  said. "

2,"Baron  Kinnock  makes  Lords  debut  |||    Former  Labour  leader  Neil  Kinnock  has  officially  been  made  a  life  peer  during  a  ceremony  in  the  House  of  Lords.  |||    He  will  be  known  Baron  Kinnock  of  Bedwellty  -  after  his  former  constituency.  Lord  Kinnock  -  who  led  Labour  from  1983  until  1992  -  was  until  recently  one  of  Britain's  EU  commissioners.  A  former  critic  of  the  House  of  Lords,  he  has  said  he  will  use  the  Upper  House  to  advocate  its  reform  and  to  talk  on  issues  like  higher  education.  ""I  accepted  the  kind  invitation  to  enter  the  House  of  Lords  as  a  working  peer  for  practical  political  reasons,""  he  said  when  his  peerage  was  first  announced.  ""It  is  a  good  base  for  campaigning  on  national  issues  like  education,  sustainable  transport,  industrial  change  and  the  ageing  society  and  global  concerns,  particularly  poverty  and  oppression.""  During  his  induction  into  the  Upper  House,  Lord  Kinnock  was  accompanied  by  Lords  Leader  Baroness  Amos  and  Baroness  Royall  of  Blaisdon,  a  former  aide  to  the  ex-Labour  leader.  It  has  been  a  long  journey  for  the  new  Lord  Kinnock  from  his  earliest  days  as  a  rebellious  youngster  in  the  south  Wales  valleys.  Born  in  1942  in  Tredegar  to  a  miner  father  and  nurse  mother,  he  attended  Lewis  Boys'  School  in  nearby  Pengam,  known  then  as  the  ""Eton  of  the  valleys"".  From  there  he  went  to  Cardiff  University,  where  he  met  his  future  wife  Glenys,  now  a  Labour  MEP.  |||    After  a  brief  career  as  a  tutor  for  the  Workers'  Educational  Association,  he  became  an  MP  at  the  age  of  just  28  for  his  home  seat  of  Bedwellty  (later  Islwyn).  He  gained  a  reputation  as  a  left-wing  firebrand,  voting  against  his  own  Labour  government's  spending  cuts  proposals  in  1975,  and  later  rejecting  a  junior  post  in  James  Callaghan's  administration.  But  he  joined  the  shadow  cabinet  in  1980,  and  after  Labour's  heavy  defeat  in  the  1983  he  was  elected  leader.  He  took  on  the  far-left  Militant  Tendency  and  began  the  long  process  of  returning  his  party  to  the  centre  ground.  He  was  not  expected  to  win  the  1987  election,  when  Margaret  Thatcher  was  still  riding  high,  but  was  bitterly  disappointed  to  lose  the  next  one  in  1992  to  John  Major,  and  stepped  down.  He  remained  an  MP  until  1995,  when  he  resigned  to  become  European  commission  for  transport.  Four  years  later  he  became  vice-president  of  the  European  Commission,  with  responsibility  for  internal  reform.  As  he  assumes  the  title  of  Lord  Kinnock,  he  has  also  become  chairman  of  the  British  Council,  which  promotes  the  UK's  reputation  for  arts,  science  and  education. "

2,"Labour  trio  'had  vote-rig  factory'  |||    Three  Labour  councillors  in  Birmingham  were  caught  operating  a  ""vote-rigging  factory"",  an  Election  Court  has  heard.  |||    Police  found  the  trio  handling  unsealed  postal  ballots  in  a  deserted  warehouse  in  the  city  during  a  late-night  raid  in  June  2004,  the  hearing  was  told.  The  votes  were  later  counted  towards  that  month's  English  local  elections.  The  men,  elected  to  the  Aston  ward,  deny  collecting  votes  fraudulently.  The  judge  presiding  has  indicated  the  whole  postal  voting  system  is  under  scrutiny.  Deputy  High  Court  Judge  Richard  Mawrey,  QC  told  the  hearing  at  the  Birmingham  and  Midlands  Institute  the  case  could  have  potentially  serious  consequences  for  any  forthcoming  General  Election.  |||    The  special  Election  Court,  the  first  in  living  memory  to  hear  allegations  of  vote-rigging,  opened  in  Birmingham  last  month.  The  case  against  Muhammad  Afzal,  Mohammed  Islam  and  Mohammed  Kazi  is  being  brought  by  local  Liberal  Democrat  supporters.  They  claim  the  trio  benefited  from  the  widespread  misuse  of  postal  votes  during  the  10  June  election.  Ravi  Sukul,  counsel  for  the  petitioners,  accused  the  three  men  of  being  ""deeply  involved""  in  illegal  practices.  Witnesses  saw  them  carrying  several  bags  from  their  campaign  office,  which  the  men  drove  to  a  warehouse  on  an  industrial  estate  off  Birch  Road  East,  the  court  was  told.  |||    The  police  were  alerted  and  called  to  the  premises.  Mr  Sukul  said:  ""When  (the  officers)  arrived  there,  in  the  middle  of  the  night,  they  saw  a  large  room  with  a  10ft  long  table  and  six  Asian  men  present.  ""Hundreds  of  documents  and  unsealed  envelopes  were  scattered  all  over  the  table.""  The  police  officers  left  the  warehouse,  but  were  later  ordered  back  to  seize  the  documents.  ""When  the  officers  left,  all  the  envelopes  and  papers  were  scattered,""  Mr  Sukul  said.  |||    ""(When  they  went)  back  to  make  the  seizure,  every  one  of  these  275  yellow  ballot  papers  were  placed  neatly  in  envelope  A  and  sealed.  The  house  was  in  order.""  Interrupting  Mr  Sukul  in  his  opening,  Mr  Mawrey  said:  ""What  you  are  saying  is,  these  men  were  operating  a  vote-forging  factory  on  an  industrial  estate.""  The  court  heard  how  documents  were  taken  by  police  to  the  elections  office  next  morning,  where  they  were  mixed  in  with  other  ballots.  The  case  against  the  men  follows  a  hearing  into  postal  fraud  allegations  made  against  three  other  Birmingham  councillors  in  the  Bordesley  Green  ward,  claims  which  are  denied.  Mr  Mawrey  is  due  to  deliver  a  judgment  in  their  case  once  the  Aston  petition  has  been  heard.  Mr  Afzal,  Mr  Islam  and  Mr  Kazi  deny  conspiring  to  commit  election  fraud  to  deceive  the  returning  officer.  The  case  continues. "

0,"Cairn  shares  slump  on  oil  setback  |||    Shares  in  Cairn  Energy,  a  UK  oil  firm,  have  closed  down  18%  after  a  disappointing  drilling  update  and  a  warning  over  possible  tax  demands.  |||    The  company  said  tests  had  shown  no  significant  finds  in  one  of  its  Indian  oil  fields,  but  was  upbeat  about  the  potential  of  other  areas.  It  also  said  the  Indian  government  had  told  it  to  pay  a  production  tax,  for  which  Cairn  argues  it  is  not  liable.  Cairn's  shares  have  jumped  by  almost  400%  this  year.  Investors  had  piled  into  Cairn  after  the  company  announced  significant  oil  finds  in  India  this  year.  Chief  executive  Bill  Gammell  said  on  Friday  he  was  ""disappointed""  with  exploration  in  the  so-called  N-C  extension  area  in  Rajasthan.  Investors  had  held  high  hopes  of  major  oil  finds  in  this  area.  But  Cairn  said  estimates  had  been  revised  in  what  was  a  ""significant  downgrade  of  the  initial  expectation"".  |||    Cairn  also  said  that  the  government  believed  the  company  was  liable  to  pay  taxes  under  its  production-sharing  contract.  The  company  said  the  rate  would  be  about  900  rupees  ($20.40;  £10.50)  per  tonne,  or  seven  barrels,  of  oil.  A  spokesman  for  the  firm  said  that  the  tax  would  wipe  5%  of  the  field's  current  value.  |||    ""Cairn  refutes  the  government's  position,""  Mr  Gammell  said.  He  insisted  that  the  contract  made  it  clear  that  the  tax  should  be  shouldered  by  the  licensee  -  India's  state-run  Oil  &  Natural  Gas  Corp  (ONGC)  -  and  not  the  contractor.  ""We  have  a  pretty  strong  legal  case  here,""  he  added,  saying  it  would  only  become  an  issue  once  the  firm  started  production.  Investors  took  a  dim  view  of  the  statements  though.  The  shares  closed  down  247p,  or  18%,  at  1115  pence.  ""I  think  people  were  slightly  over-ambitious  for  how  quickly  Cairn  would  be  able  to  develop  and  potentially  offload  these  reserves,""  said  analyst  Jason  Kenney  at  ING.  |||    The  disappointments  overshadowed  increased  production  targets  for  Cairn's  existing  oilfields.  The  company  raised  targets  for  its  Mangala  and  Aishwariya  fields  in  India  from  60,000  barrels  a  day  to  between  80,000  and  100,000  barrels  a  day.  Its  Mangala  field,  thought  to  contain  a  billion  barrels,  is  its  biggest  find  to  date.  ""These  two  fields  will  provide  the  core  of  the  future  developments  in  Rajasthan,""  Mr  Gammell  said.  Cairn  added  that  it  would  be  appraising  another  field  early  next  year.  Mr  Gammell  set  up  the  company  in  the  1980s  and  has  successfully  switched  its  focus  to  South  Asia  from  interests  in  the  US  and  Europe.  Cairn,  which  also  operates  in  Nepal  and  Bangladesh,  was  catapulted  into  the  FTSE  100  index  of  leading  UK  shares  earlier  this  year  after  the  sharp  rise  in  its  share  price.

2,"UK  set  to  cut  back  on  embassies  |||    Nine  overseas  embassies  and  high  commissions  will  close  in  an  effort  to  save  money,  UK  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  has  announced.  |||    The  Bahamas,  East  Timor,  Madagascar  and  Swaziland  are  among  the  areas  affected  by  the  biggest  shake-up  for  the  diplomatic  service  for  years.  Other  diplomatic  posts  are  being  turned  over  to  local  staff.  Mr  Straw  said  the  move  would  save  £6m  a  year  to  free  up  cash  for  priorities  such  as  fighting  terrorism.  |||    Honorary  consuls  will  be  appointed  in  some  of  the  areas  affected  by  the  embassy  closures.  Nine  consulates  or  consulates  general  will  also  be  closed,  mostly  in  Europe  and  America.  |||    They  include  Dallas  in  the  US,  Bordeaux  in  France  and  Oporto  in  Portugal,  with  local  staff  replacing  UK  representation  in  another  11.  The  changes  are  due  to  be  put  in  place  before  the  end  of  2006,  with  most  savings  made  from  cutting  staff  and  running  costs.  Some  of  the  money  will  have  to  be  used  to  fund  redundancy  payments.  In  a  written  statement,  Mr  Straw  said:  ""The  savings  made  will  help  to  underpin  higher  priority  work  in  line  with  the  Foreign  and  Commonwealth  Office's  strategic  priorities,  including  counter-  proliferation,  counter-terrorism,  energy  and  climate  change.  ""Some  of  the  savings  will  also  be  redeployed  to  strategic  priority  work  within  certain  regions  where  we  are  closing  posts.  ""In  Africa,  for  instance,  we  plan  to  create  new  jobs  to  cover  these  issues  across  the  region,  with  a  new  post  in  Nairobi  to  help  support  our  work  on  climate  change,  one  in  Nigeria  to  cover  energy  and  one  in  Pretoria  to  cover  regional  issues  more  generally  as  well  as  covering  Maseru  and  Mbabane.""  |||    The  Foreign  Office  currently  has  about  6,100  UK-based  staff.  It  has  opened  major  new  missions  on  Baghdad  and  Basra  in  Iraq,  Kabul  in  Afghanistan  and  Pyongyang  in  North  Korea  since  1997  in  response  to  what  the  government  says  are  changing  needs.  Since  1997  10  overseas  posts  have  been  closed  -  excluding  Wednesday's  cuts  -  but  18  new  embassies  or  consulates  have  been  opened.  The  shake-up  is  aimed  at  helping  making  £86m  in  efficiency  savings  between  2005  and  2008.  The  chancellor  has  demanded  all  government  departments  make  similar  savings.  Shadow  foreign  secretary  Michael  Ancram  said  there  was  a  constant  need  to  ensure  value  for  money  from  foreign  missions.  ""But  the  government  must  give  a  far  clearer  reason  for  making  the  dramatic  changes  it  has  announced  and  must  show  that  British  commercial  interests  and  the  interests  of  Britons  abroad  will  not  be  adversely  affected,""  he  said.

2,"Fox  attacks  Blair's  Tory  'lies'  |||    Tony  Blair  lied  when  he  took  the  UK  to  war  so  has  no  qualms  about  lying  in  the  election  campaign,  say  the  Tories.  |||    Tory  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  was  speaking  after  Mr  Blair  told  Labour  members  the  Tories  offered  a  ""hard  right  agenda"".  Dr  Fox  told  BBC  Radio:  ""If  you  are  willing  to  lie  about  the  reasons  for  going  to  war,  I  guess  you  are  going  to  lie  about  anything  at  all.""  He  would  not  discuss  reports  the  party  repaid  £500,000  to  Lord  Ashcroft  after  he  predicted  an  election  defeat.  |||    The  prime  minister  ratcheted  up  Labour's  pre-election  campaigning  at  the  weekend  with  a  helicopter  tour  of  the  country  and  his  speech  at  the  party's  spring  conference.  He  insisted  he  did  not  know  the  poll  date,  but  it  is  widely  expected  to  be  5  May.  |||    In  what  was  seen  as  a  highly  personal  speech  in  Gateshead  on  Sunday,  Mr  Blair  said:  ""I  have  the  same  passion  and  hunger  as  when  I  first  walked  through  the  door  of  10  Downing  Street.""  He  described  his  relationship  with  the  public  as  starting  euphoric,  then  struggling  to  live  up  to  the  expectations,  and  reaching  the  point  of  raised  voices  and  ""throwing  crockery"".  He  warned  his  supporters  against  complacency,  saying:  ""It's  a  fight  for  the  future  of  our  country,  it's  a  fight  that  for  Britain  and  the  people  of  Britain  we  have  to  win.""  |||    Mr  Blair  said  that  whether  the  public  chose  Michael  Howard  or  Mr  Kennedy,  it  would  result  in  ""a  Tory  government  not  a  Labour  government  and  a  country  that  goes  back  and  does  not  move  forward"".  Dr  Fox  accused  Mr  Blair  and  other  Cabinet  ministers  of  telling  lies  about  their  opponents'  policies  and  then  attacking  the  lies.  ""What  we  learned  at  the  weekend  is  what  Labour  tactics  are  going  to  be  and  it's  going  to  be  fear  and  smear,""  he  told  BBC  News.  The  Tory  co-chairman  attacked  Labour's  six  new  pledges  as  ""vacuous""  and  said  Mr  Blair  was  very  worried  voters  would  take  revenge  for  his  failure  to  deliver.  Dr  Fox  refused  to  discuss  weekend  newspaper  reports  that  the  party  had  repaid  £500,000  to  former  Tory  Treasurer  Lord  Ashcroft  after  he  said  the  party  could  not  win  the  election.  ""We  repay  loans  when  they  are  due  but  do  not  comment  to  individual  financial  matters,""  he  said,  insisting  he  enjoyed  a  ""warm  and  constructive""  relationship  to  Lord  Ashcroft.  |||    Meanwhile  Lib  Dem  leader  Charles  Kennedy  is  expected  to  attack  Mr  Blair's  words  as  he  begins  a  nationwide  tour  on  Monday.  Mr  Kennedy  is  accelerating  Lib  Dem  election  preparations  this  week  as  he  visits  Manchester,  Liverpool,  Leicester,  Somerset,  Basingstoke,  Shrewsbury,  Dorset  and  Torbay.  He  said:  ""This  is  three-party  politics.  In  the  northern  cities,  the  contest  is  between  Labour  and  the  Liberal  Democrats.  ""In  southern  and  rural  seats  -  especially  in  the  South  West  -  the  principal  contenders  are  the  Liberal  Democrats  and  the  Conservatives,  who  are  out  of  the  running  in  Scotland  and  Wales.""  The  Lib  Dems  accuse  Mr  Blair  of  making  a  ""touchy-feely""  speech  to  Labour  delegates  which  will  not  help  him  regain  public  trust. "

2,"Jowell  confirms  casino  climbdown  |||    Tessa  Jowell  has  announced  plans  to  limit  the  number  of  new  casinos  in  the  UK  to  24,  in  a  move  branded  a  ""humiliating  retreat""  by  the  Tories.  |||    It  puts  an  end  to  plans  for  up  to  40  super  casinos,  originally  outlined  in  the  government's  Gambling  Bill.  Instead  there  will  be  a  cap  of  eight  new  casinos  in  each  size  category  -  small,  medium  and  large.  The  Culture  Secretary  said  the  move  showed  she  listened  to  critics  who  feared  an  explosion  in  gambling.  |||    But  Conservative  shadow  culture  secretary  John  Whittingdale  said  the  way  the  government  had  handled  the  bill  was  a  ""shambles"".  ""This  announcement  is  a  further  humiliating  retreat  by  the  government.  ""Instead  of  the  initial  intention  of  the  gambling  bill,  to  liberalise  the  rules  governing  gambling,  the  bill  now  imposes  a  more  restrictive  regime  than  exists  at  present.""  Shares  in  British  casino  operators  London  Clubs  International,  Rank  Group  and  Stanley  Leisure,  who  had  been  hoping  the  bill  would  pave  the  way  for  a  big  expansion  in  smaller  casinos,  fell  by  between  10  and  25%  following  the  announcement.  Ms  Jowell's  deputy,  Richard  Caborn,  said  the  government  had  adopted  a  cautious  approach  to  the  issue,  and  responded  to  the  concerns  raised.  ""Limiting  the  number  of  regional  casinos  to  eight  in  the  first  phase  is  a  cautious  move  that  will  allow  us  to  test  the  impact  of  a  new  kind  of  casino  on  the  levels  of  problem  gambling,""  he  said.  ""We  also  believe  it's  right  to  apply  this  same  level  of  caution  to  small  and  large  casinos.""  |||    He  added  that  local  authorities  would  still  be  able  to  stop  new  casinos  coming  to  their  areas.  Church  groups  welcomed  the  limit  on  the  number  of  casinos.  Salvation  Army  spokesman  Jonathan  Lomax  said:  ""The  proliferation  of  these  casinos  on  high  streets  across  the  country  was  a  real  concern  and  the  [three  year]  trial  period,  which  we  think  should  last  at  least  five  years,  will  enable  research  into  the  potentially  severe  social  consequences  of  an  increase  in  hard  and  addictive  forms  of  gambling.""  But  British  British  Casino  Association  Chairman  Penny  Cobham  said  her  members  were  ""outraged""  by  the  decision,  which  followed  a  campaign  in  the  Daily  Mail  newspaper.  ""There  was  never  going  to  be  a  massive  explosion  of  casinos.  Talk  of  a  casino  on  every  High  Street  was  just  a  scaring  tactic."" "

2,"Howard  pitches  for  UK  ethnic  vote  |||    Michael  Howard  is  to  make  a  pitch  for  Britain's  ethnic  vote  urging  people  who  feel  ""taken  for  granted""  by  Tony  Blair  to  vote  Conservative.  |||    He  will  say  Conservatives  ""share  the  same  values""  as  the  UK's  minorities.  And  that  he  wants  to  build  a  ""better  Britain""  where  everyone,  whatever  the  colour  of  their  skin  or  religion,  can  ""make  the  most  of  their  talents"".  But  the  Tory  leader  will  argue  against  positive  discrimination  saying  it  is  ""outdated  and  unjust"".  |||    ""It  sets  family  against  family  and  it  leads  ethnic  communities  to  doubt  their  own  abilities,""  he  will  argue.  Mr  Howard  -  himself  the  son  of  immigrants  -  will  acknowledge  that  racial  discrimination  still  exists  in  the  UK.  ""People  from  ethnic  communities,  for  example,  still  earn  less  than  their  white  counterparts,""  he  will  say  before  arguing  the  answer  to  helping  everyone  to  get  on  was  ""free  enterprise,  free  trade,  free  speech"".  The  Tory  leader  will  also  call  for  religious  tolerance  arguing  that  Hindus  and  Sikhs  as  well  as  Muslims  got  ""caught  in  the  downdraft  of  Islamaphobia  which  was  one  of  the  terrible  side  effects  of  9/11"".  |||    Mr  Howard  will  make  his  speech  during  a  visit  to  support  Tory  Parliamentary  hopefuls  Robert  Light  and  Sayeeda  Warsi  -  ""the  first  British  Muslim  woman""  selected  to  run  for  MP  as  a  Conservative  candidate.  He  will  attack  Labour's  record  in  government  over  issues  such  as  tax  and  he  will  set  out  Tory  plans  for  an  immigration  quota  to  be  set  by  MPs.  Mr  Howard  will  also  attack  the  Lib  Dems  for  wanting  to  abolish  faith  schools,  introduce  compulsory  sex  education  from  the  age  of  seven,  and  ""give  contraceptives  out  in  schools  from  the  age  of  11"".  ""So  I  say  to  all  those  people  from  ethnic  minorities  who  feel  Mr  Blair  and  the  Liberal  Democrats  take  their  votes  for  granted  -  come  join  us,""  he  will  say.  Lib  Dem  president  Simon  Hughes  branded  Mr  Howard  ""arrogant  and  wrong""  for  claiming  the  Tories  were  the  ""natural  party""  for  Britain's  ethnic  minorities.  ""Given  the  Tories'  considerably  reduced  support  in  urban  areas,  where  many  black  and  Asian  Britons  live,  during  their  time  in  power,  the  evidence  simply  does  not  support  his  claims  that  the  Conservatives  are  the  party  for  these  communities,""  he  said. "

2,"Blair  prepares  to  name  poll  date  |||    Tony  Blair  is  likely  to  name  5  May  as  election  day  when  Parliament  returns  from  its  Easter  break,  the  BBC's  political  editor  has  learned.  |||    Andrew  Marr  says  Mr  Blair  will  ask  the  Queen  on  4  or  5  April  to  dissolve  Parliament  at  the  end  of  that  week.  Mr  Blair  has  so  far  resisted  calls  for  him  to  name  the  day  but  all  parties  have  stepped  up  campaigning  recently.  Downing  Street  would  not  be  drawn  on  the  claim,  saying  election  timing  was  a  matter  for  the  prime  minister.  |||    A  Number  10  spokeswoman  would  only  say:  ""He  will  announce  an  election  when  he  wants  to  announce  an  election.""  The  move  will  signal  a  frantic  week  at  Westminster  as  the  government  is  likely  to  try  to  get  key  legislation  through  Parliament.  The  government  needs  its  finance  bill,  covering  the  Budget  plans,  to  be  passed  before  the  Commons  closes  for  business  at  the  end  of  the  session  on  7  April.  |||    But  it  will  also  seek  to  push  through  its  Serious  and  Organised  Crime  Bill  and  ID  cards  Bill.  Mr  Marr  said  on  Wednesday's  Today  programme:  ""There's  almost  nobody  at  a  senior  level  inside  the  government  or  in  Parliament  itself  who  doesn't  expect  the  election  to  be  called  on  4  or  5  April.  ""As  soon  as  the  Commons  is  back  after  the  short  Easter  recess,  Tony  Blair  whips  up  to  the  Palace,  asks  the  Queen  to  dissolve  Parliament  ...  and  we're  going.""  The  Labour  government  officially  has  until  June  2006  to  hold  general  election,  but  in  recent  years  governments  have  favoured  four-year  terms. "

1,"British  stars  denied  major  Oscars  |||    British  hopes  of  winning  major  Oscars  were  dashed  as  UK  stars  failed  to  win  acting  and  directing  prizes.  |||    Despite  three  nominations,  Mike  Leigh's  Vera  Drake  failed  to  take  the  director  or  screenplay  awards  and  there  was  no  prize  for  star  Imelda  Staunton.  Kate  Winslet  also  lost  to  best  actress  Hilary  Swank,  while  Clive  Owen  and  Sophie  Okonedo  failed  to  win  best  supporting  actor  awards.  The  UK's  Andrea  Arnold  won  the  short  film  award  for  her  gritty  drama  Wasp.  |||    Arnold,  who  presented  children's  television  shows  Number  73  and  Motormouth  in  the  1980s,  said  it  was  ""totally  overwhelming""  to  win.  Wasp  tells  the  story  of  a  single  mother  living  on  the  breadline,  beating  films  by  fellow  UK  nominees  Gary  McKendry  and  Ashvin  Kumar.  |||    ""Everyone  worked  extremely  hard  -  they  know  who  they  are,""  Arnold  said  as  she  accepted  the  prize.  ""The  beers  are  on  me  when  we  get  home.""  Earlier  British  costume  designer  Sandy  Powell  won  the  Oscar  for  The  Aviator,  beating  Finding  Neverland's  UK  designer  Alexandra  Byrne  in  the  process.  ""I'm  very  thrilled  for  the  film  and  all  the  people  who  worked  with  me,""  said  Ms  Powell.  ""Hopefully  I'll  be  staying  up  to  celebrate  -  I've  been  sick  for  three  days  and  want  to  make  it  through  the  night.""  The  British  visual  effects  team  behind  Harry  Potter  and  the  Prisoner  of  Azkaban  were  less  fortunate,  however,  losing  the  Oscar  in  that  category  to  Spider-Man  2.  Before  Sunday's  ceremony  Owen  was  bookmakers'  favourite  for  his  role  in  romantic  drama  Closer  that  had  already  clinched  him  a  Golden  Globe  award.  It  was  the  first  time  actress  Okonedo  had  been  shortlisted,  chosen  for  her  performance  in  Hotel  Rwanda  about  the  1994  Rwandan  genocide.  It  was  also  a  debut  nomination  for  Staunton,  49,  who  played  abortionist  Vera  Drake  in  Mike  Leigh's  film.  |||    Leigh  had  previously  received  three  Oscar  nominations  for  Secrets  and  Lies  and  Topsy  Turvy.  Winslet  said  she  was  ""ecstatic""  about  the  fourth  Oscar  nomination  of  her  career,  this  time  for  her  lead  role  in  Eternal  Sunshine  of  the  Spotless  Mind.  Among  other  British  talent  nominated  for  Oscars,  composer  Andrew  Lloyd  Webber  and  lyricist  Charles  Hart  were  nominated  for  best  original  song  for  Learn  To  Be  Lonely,  from  The  Phantom  of  the  Opera  movie.  That  award  was  won  by  Al  Otro  Lado  Del  Rio  from  The  Motorcycle  Diaries.  Cinematographer  John  Mathieson,  who  was  nominated  for  Gladiator  in  2001,  was  also  up  for  The  Phantom  of  the  Opera  but  lost  to  The  Aviator.  Finding  Neverland  garnered  another  nomination  for  British  talent,  with  Gemma  Jackson  shortlisted  for  the  art  direction  prize.  She  lost  in  that  category  to  The  Aviator.  A  spokesman  for  the  UK  Film  Council  said:  ""It  is  disappointing  not  to  have  more  British  winners.""  He  added:  ""It  was  extraordinary  to  have  24  British  nominees  in  the  initial  list  of  nominees."" "

1,"Russian  film  wins  BBC  world  prize  |||    Russian  drama  The  Return  (Vozvrashchenie)  has  been  named  winner  of  the  BBC  Four  World  Cinema  Award.  |||    The  film  tells  the  story  of  two  adolescent  boys  who  are  subjected  to  a  harsh  regime  when  their  strict  father  returns  after  a  10-year  absence.  Directed  by  Andrey  Zvyagintsev,  The  Return  previously  won  the  2003  Golden  Lion  award  at  the  Venice  Film  Festival.  The  prize  was  presented  at  an  awards  ceremony  held  in  London  on  Thursday  and  hosted  by  Jonathan  Ross.  The  winner  was  chosen  by  a  panel  which  included  X  Files  actress  Gillian  Anderson,  critic  Roger  Clarke  and  Touching  the  Void  director  Kevin  McDonald.  |||    Ross,  who  is  the  presenter  of  BBC  One's  Film  2005,  was  also  involved  in  the  deliberations.  A  shortlist  of  six  films  from  around  the  world  had  been  drawn  up  from  which  the  panel  chose.  Other  nominees  included  the  Motorcycle  Diaries,  Zatoichi  and  Hero.  A  viewer  poll  saw  director  Zhang  Yimou's  martial  arts  epic  Hero  emerge  as  the  favourite  with  32%  of  votes  cast.  Tragedy  struck  the  production  of  The  Return  when  one  of  the  young  stars,  15-year-old  Vladimir  Girin,  drowned  in  a  lake.  The  winner  of  the  World  Cinema  Award  last  year  was  the  French  animated  feature  Belleville  Rendezvous "

1,"Van  Gogh  festival  film  withdrawn  |||    Murdered  director  Theo  van  Gogh's  controversial  film  Submission  has  been  pulled  from  the  Rotterdam  Film  Festival  because  of  security  fears.  |||    It  was  one  of  three  of  his  works  to  be  shown  as  part  of  a  freedom  of  expression  event  in  tribute  to  the  late  film-maker's  life.  The  film  is  critical  of  the  treatment  of  women  under  Islam.  Its  TV  screening  is  thought  to  have  led  to  his  murder.  The  10-day  Dutch  festival  begins  on  Wednesday.  Submission  was  made  with  liberal  Somali-Dutch  politician  Ayaan  Hirsi  Ali  and  was  due  to  be  shown  on  30  January.  Van  Gogh  was  shot  and  stabbed  to  death  in  November  2004  several  months  after  receiving  death  threats  following  Submission's  first  broadcast  on  Dutch  television.  Two  of  Van  Gogh's  other  films  will  be  shown  as  planned,  including  the  theatrical  world  premiere  of  his  last  feature  06/05.  |||    Festival  director  Sandra  den  Hamer  said:  ""The  festival  reflects  what  happens  around  us  and  within  cinema  itself.""  The  festival  opens  with  the  French  film  The  10th  District  Court,  Moments  of  Trials  made  by  Raymond  Depardon.  The  event  sees  14  films  competing  to  win  three  Top  Tiger  Awards  which  aim  to  introduce  promising  new  talent.  New  sections  added  to  this  year's  festival  include  Cinema  of  the  Future  and  Cinema  of  the  World,  with  special  focus  on  Russian  and  south-east  Asian  productions.  There  is  also  an  Iraqi-German  offering  entitled  Underexposure,  which  looks  at  life  in  Iraq  after  Saddam  Hussein. "

1,"New  Harry  Potter  tops  book  chart  |||    Harry  Potter  and  the  Half-Blood  Prince  has  topped  Amazon's  book  chart  less  than  24  hours  after  its  release  date  -  16  July  -  was  announced.  |||    Thousands  of  customers  placed  pre-orders  on  the  amazon.co.uk  website  for  the  sixth  book  in  the  series.  Rowling  revealed  she  had  completed  the  novel  on  Tuesday,  ahead  of  the  scheduled  announcement  on  25  December.  It  will  be  published  simultaneously  in  the  UK,  the  US,  Canada,  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  South  Africa.  JK  Rowling's  fifth  book  in  the  wizard  series,  Harry  Potter  and  Order  of  the  Phoenix  was  Amazon's  largest  pre-ordered  item  ever,  with  420,000  copies  pre-ordered  prior  to  its  release  in  June  2003.  Customers  who  pre-order  Harry  Potter  and  the  Half-Blood  Prince  avoid  standing  in  long  queues  at  bookshops  on  the  day  of  the  book's  release  next  July.  ""The  fact  that  the  book  has  already  hit  number  one  in  our  Hot  100  books  chart  shows  how  incredibly  excited  customers  are  about  the  sixth  Harry  Potter,""  said  Amazon's  Robin  Terrell.  |||    Harry  Potter  and  the  Half-Blood  Prince  takes  up  the  story  of  Harry  Potter's  sixth  year  at  Hogwarts  School  of  Witchcraft  and  Wizardry  as  Lord  Voldemort  grows  stronger.  Rowling  has  already  revealed  that  the  Half-Blood  Prince  is  neither  Harry  nor  Voldemort.  And  she  added  that  the  opening  chapter  of  the  book  had  been  brewing  in  her  mind  for  13  years.  Rowling  said  she  had  plenty  of  time  while  pregnant  ""to  tinker  with  the  manuscript  to  my  satisfaction  and  I  am  as  happy  as  I  have  ever  been  with  the  end  result"".  She  also  previously  revealed  that  a  character  will  be  killed  in  the  sixth  book,  but  she  has  given  no  hints  as  to  who  it  might  be.  Following  publication  of  the  sixth  book,  just  one  novel  remains  to  complete  the  series. "

2,"Kennedy  to  make  temple  address  |||    Charles  Kennedy  is  set  to  address  2,000  people  at  a  Hindu  temple  as  part  of  an  appeal  to  ethnic  minority  voters.  |||    The  Liberal  Democrat  leader  will  visit  the  Shri  Swaminarayan  Mandir  Temple  in  Neasden,  north  west  London.  He  will  say  Labour  ""can  no  longer  lay  exclusive  claim  to  the  votes  of  Britain's  ethnic  minorities"".  Mr  Kennedy  will  also  highlight  the  anger  among  people  of  ""all  races""  over  the  Iraq  war  and  call  for  a  ""balanced  approach""  to  tackling  terrorism.  Saturday's  speech  comes  days  after  the  Lib  Dems  launched  their  ethnic  minority  mini-manifesto.  Mr  Kennedy  is  to  tell  the  audience:  ""Many  people  in  Britain,  of  all  races,  cultures  and  religions,  were  angry  about  the  way  we  were  taken  to  war  in  Iraq.  ""And  they  saw  the  principled  stand  the  Liberal  Democrats  took  at  the  time.""  |||    He  will  also  say  that  the  Lib  Dems  want  to  ""restore  Britain's  reputation  on  the  world  stage""  by  fighting  international  poverty  and  climate  change,  and  protecting  human  rights.  Mr  Kennedy  will  say  that  a  ""balanced  approach""  to  tackling  terrorism  would  mean  ""tough  measures  to  make  Britain  safe  -  but  not  at  the  expense  of  people's  fundamental  legal  rights  like  has  happened  at  Belmarsh"".  He  will  say  it  also  means  acting  through  the  United  Nations  on  terrorism.  Mr  Kennedy  held  talks  with  Tony  Blair  on  Friday  over  government  plans  to  hold  terror  suspects  under  house  arrest.  He  said  afterwards  that  the  Prime  Minister  had  offered  some  ""movement""  to  address  his  concerns.  The  plans  face  trouble  in  the  Lords  if  Conservative  and  Lib  Dem  opposition  continues. "

1,"German  music  in  a  'zombie'  state  |||    The  German  music  business  -  the  third  largest  in  the  world  -  is  ""in  the  state  of  a  zombie""  because  it  has  failed  to  respond  to  the  challenge  posed  by  downloading  and  piracy,  a  leading  industry  figure  has  said.  |||    Tim  Renner,  the  head  of  Universal  Music  Germany  until  last  year,  told  BBC  World  Service's  The  Music  Biz  programme  that  the  country's  music  industry  was  now  struggling  to  survive.  Renner  warned  that  unless  the  industry  accepted  ""new  realties""  -  such  as  downloading  -  its  decline  could  become  irreversible.  ""The  problem  the  music  industry  has  got  is  that  they  aren't  willing  to  accept  that  the  classic  way  of  doing  business  is  over  and  out,""  he  stated.  ""So  the  music  industry  in  its  current  form  over  here  is  pretty  much  in  the  state  of  a  zombie.""  |||    The  music  market  in  Germany  peaked  in  1997,  with  sales  of  2.6bn  euros  (£1.8bn).  Since  2000,  sales  have  plummeted  to  just  1.6bn  euros  (£1.1bn)  in  2003.  In  the  space  of  one  year  -  between  2002  and  2003  -  CD  album  sales  fell  by  13.8%.  But  a  study  by  the  Society  for  Consumer  Research  found  that  at  the  same  time,  more  than  twice  as  many  recordable  CDs  had  music  recorded  on  them  than  CD  albums  were  sold.  Mr  Renner  pointed  out  that,  because  profit  comes  mainly  from  the  longevity  of  a  good-selling  record,  this  was  particularly  damaging.  |||    ""You  need  time,""  he  added.  However,  Peter  Zombic,  the  managing  director  of  the  International  Federation  of  Phonographic  Industry  in  Germany,  said  he  did  not  feel  the  situation  was  as  ""dramatic""  as  Mr  Renner  believed.  ""It's  quite  true  that  we  have  severe  problems  in  Germany  -  but  that's  true  in  other  parts  of  the  world  and  in  most  developed  markets  too,""  he  argued.  ""We  have  a  severe  problem  with  piracy,  especially  internet  piracy,  and  we  also  have  a  severe  problem  of  private  copying.  ""I  don't  agree  that  the  music  industry  lost  control  over  the  music  market  -  in  fact,  especially  in  regard  to  Germany  talent,  the  market  is  quite  successful.""  He  did,  however,  admit  that  copyright  owners  have  ""partly  lost  control  of  their  copyright"",  due  to  piracy  and  copying.  |||    But  he  refuted  suggestions  that  the  industry  had  been  too  slow  to  respond  to  digital  downloading.  ""We  were  the  first  to  implement  a  download  service  -  back  in  1997,""  he  argued.  ""At  that  time  it  was  not  successful,  because  of  the  advent  of  piracy  -  it  was  the  Napster  time,  when  P2P  services  became  popular.  ""It  still  is  quite  difficult  for  the  music  industry  to  compete  with  a  price  that  is  zero  as  far  as  the  illegal  product  is  concerned.""  Mr  Zombic  also  called  for  a  change  to  the  perception  in  Germany  that  private  copying  of  music  is  not  a  problem.  German  law  does  allow  people  to  make  copies  of  CDs  for  their  family  and  close  friends,  without  fear  of  breaking  copyright.  Mr  Zombic  said  that  this  legal  framework  was  a  ""huge  problem"".  ""There  is  a  widespread  attitude  that  private  copying  is  a  hobby,  it's  nice,  it's  fun,""  he  added.  ""We  try  to  make  clear  it's  not  nice  and  it's  not  fun  -  it's  endangering  the  creativity  in  our  country."" "

0,"Budget  Aston  takes  on  Porsche  |||    British  car  maker  Aston  Martin  has  gone  head-to-head  with  Porsche's  911  sports  cars  with  the  launch  of  its  cheapest  model  yet.  |||    With  a  price  tag  under  £80,000,  the  V8  Vantage  is  tens  of  thousands  of  pounds  cheaper  than  existing  Aston  models.  The  Vantage  is  ""the  most  important  car  in  the  history  of  our  company"",  said  Aston's  chief  executive  Ulrich  Bez.  Aston  -  whose  cars  were  famously  used  by  James  Bond  -  will  unveil  the  Vantage  at  the  Geneva  Motor  Show  on  Thursday.  Mr  Bez  -  himself  a  former  executive  at  rival  Porsche  -  said  the  new  car  was  the  company's  ""most  affordable  car  ever  and  makes  the  brand  accessible"".  This  in  turn  would  make  Aston  Martin  ""globally  visible,  but  still  very,  very  exclusive"",  he  added.  |||    First  shown  as  a  concept  car  at  the  2003  North  American  International  Auto  Show  in  Detroit,  the  V8  Vantage  will  be  available  in  the  UK  in  late  summer.  Development  costs  for  the  Vantage  have  been  kept  low  by  sharing  a  platform  with  Aston's  DB9,  which  Mr  Bez  described  as  ""the  previous  most  important  car  for  our  company"".  There  is  currently  an  18  months  waiting  list  for  the  DB9,  Mr  Bez  said.  The  Vantage  will  be  built  at  the  new  Aston  factory  in  Gaydon,  near  Warwick,  and  should  more  than  double  Aston's  total  output  from  about  2,000  presently. "

0,"McDonald's  boss  Bell  dies  aged  44  |||    Charlie  Bell,  the  straight-talking  former  head  of  fast-food  giant  McDonald's,  has  died  of  cancer  aged  44.  |||    Mr  Bell  was  diagnosed  with  colorectal  cancer  in  May  last  year,  a  month  after  taking  over  the  top  job.  He  resigned  in  November  to  fight  the  illness.  Joining  the  company  as  a  15-year-old  part-time  worker,  Mr  Bell  quickly  moved  through  its  ranks,  becoming  Australia's  youngest  store  manager  at  19.  A  popular  go-getter,  he  is  credited  with  helping  revive  McDonald's  sales.  Mr  Bell  leaves  a  wife  and  daughter.  ""As  we  mourn  his  passing,  I  ask  you  to  keep  Charlie's  family  in  your  hearts  and  prayers,""  chief  executive  James  Skinner  said  in  a  statement.  ""And  remember  that  in  his  abbreviated  time  on  this  earth,  Charlie  lived  life  to  the  fullest.""  ""No  matter  what  cards  life  dealt,  Charlie  stayed  centred  on  his  love  for  his  family  and  for  McDonald's.""  |||    After  running  the  company's  Australian  business  in  the  1990s,  Mr  Bell  moved  to  the  US  in  1999  to  run  operations  in  Asia,  Africa  and  the  Middle  East.  In  2001,  he  took  over  the  reins  in  Europe,  McDonald's  second  most  important  market.  He  became  chief  operating  officer  and  president  in  2002.  Mr  Bell  took  over  as  chief  executive  after  his  predecessor  as  CEO,  Jim  Cantalupo,  died  suddenly  of  a  heart  attack  in  April.  Having  worked  closely  with  Mr  Cantalupo,  who  came  out  of  retirement  to  turn  McDonald's  around,  Mr  Bell  focused  on  boosting  demand  at  existing  restaurants  rather  than  follow  a  policy  of  rapid  expansion.  He  had  promised  not  to  let  the  company  get  ""fat,  dumb  and  happy,""  and,  according  to  Reuters,  once  told  analysts  that  he  would  shove  a  fire  hose  down  the  throat  of  competitors  if  he  saw  them  drowning.  Mr  Bell  oversaw  McDonald's  ""I'm  lovin'  it""  advertising  campaign  and  introduced  successes  such  as  McCafe,  now  the  biggest  coffee  shop  brand  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand.  Colleagues  said  that  Mr  Bell  was  proud  of  his  humble  beginnings,  helping  out  behind  cash  tills  and  clearing  tables  when  visiting  restaurants. "

1,"Ring  of  Fire  hit  co-writer  dies  |||    Merle  Kilgore,  co-writer  of  the  country  hit  Ring  of  Fire,  has  died  of  congestive  heart  failure  aged  70.  |||    He  started  out  as  a  singer  and  songwriter  before  going  into  music  management,  looking  after  country  star  Hank  Williams  Jr.  He  wrote  Ring  of  Fire  with  June  Carter  Cash,  the  future  wife  of  Johnny  Cash  who  went  on  to  score  his  most  popular  hit  with  the  track.  Kilgore  had  heart  surgery  in  2004  and  was  also  diagnosed  with  lung  cancer.  His  death  has  been  attributed  to  treatment  he  was  undergoing  for  the  cancer.  His  first  self-penned  top  10  hit  was  Dear  Mama  in  1959.  |||    One  of  the  first  songs  he  wrote  for  other  artists  was  Wolverton  Mountain,  which  sold  10  million  copies  when  recorded  by  Claude  King.  He  then  wrote  Ring  of  Fire  with  June  Carter  Cash,  which  was  about  her  unrequited  love  for  Johnny,  who  she  later  married.  It  was  first  recorded  by  her  younger  sister  Anita  Carter  before  Johnny  went  on  to  make  such  a  success  of  it.  June  Carter  Cash  previously  said  it  upset  her  husband  when  Kilgore  talked  about  the  song  without  crediting  her  and  believed  he  should  not  have  been  credited  on  it.  Last  year,  Kilgore  turned  up  an  awards  dinner  in  a  wheelchair  expecting  to  honour  Hank  Williams  Jr,  but  instead  he  was  the  surprise  recipient  of  a  lifetime  achievement  award  from  the  International  Entertainment  Buyers  Association.

0,"Turkey  turns  on  the  economic  charm  |||    Three  years  after  a  gruelling  economic  crisis,  Turkey  has  dressed  its  economy  to  impress.  |||    As  part  of  a  charm  offensive  -  ahead  of  17  December,  when  the  European  Union  will  decide  whether  to  start  entry  talks  -  Turkey's  economic  leaders  have  been  banging  the  drum  to  draw  attention  to  recent  achievements.  The  economy  is  growing  fast,  they  insist.  Education  levels  among  its  young  and  large  population  are  rising.  Unemployment  levels,  in  percentage  terms,  are  heading  fast  towards  single  digits.  Inflation  is  under  control.  A  new  law  to  govern  its  turbulent  banking  system  is  on  the  cards.  The  tourism  industry  is  booming  and  revenues  from  visitors  should  more  than  double  to  $21bn  (£10.8bn)  in  three  years.  |||    Moreover,  government  spending  is  set  to  be  frozen  and  a  burdensome  social  security  deficit  is  being  tackled.  Income  and  corporate  taxes  will  be  cut  next  year  in  order  to  attract  $15bn  of  foreign  investment  over  the  next  three  years.  A  loan  restructuring  deal  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  is  pretty  much  in  the  can.  And  following  recent  macroeconomic  restructuring  efforts,  its  currency  is  floating  freely  and  its  central  bank  is  independent.  |||    The  point  of  all  this  has  been  to  convince  Europe's  decision  makers  that  rather  than  being  a  phenomenally  costly  exercise  for  the  EU,  allowing  Turkey  in  would  in  fact  bring  masses  of  economic  benefits.  |||    ""The  cake  will  be  bigger  for  everybody,""  said  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Abdullatif  Sener  earlier  this  month.  ""Turkey  will  not  be  a  burden  for  the  EU  budget.""  If  admitted  into  the  EU,  Turkey  would  contribute  almost  6bn  euros  ($8bn;  £6bn)  to  its  budget  by  2014,  according  to  a  recent  impact  study  by  the  country's  State  Planning  Organisation.  As  Turkey's  gross  domestic  output  (GDP)  is  set  to  grow  by  6%  per  year  on  average,  its  contribution  would  rise  from  less  than  5bn  euros  in  2014  to  almost  9bn  euros  by  2020.  Turkey  could  also  help  alleviate  a  labour  shortage  in  ""Old  Europe""  once  its  population  comes  of  age.  By  2014,  one  in  four  Turks  -  or  about  18  million  people  -  will  be  aged  14  or  less.  ""A  literate  and  qualified  Turkish  population,""  insisted  Mr  Sener,  ""will  make  a  positive  impact  on  the  EU.""  |||    This  runs  contrary  to  the  popular  view  that  Turkey  is  getting  ready  to  dig  deep  into  EU  taxpayers'  wallets.  However,  Turkey's  assertions  are  confirmed  by  Brussels'  own  impact  studies,  which  indeed  say  that  Turkish  membership  would  be  good  news  for  the  EU  economy.  But  only  over  time.  Costs  are  projected  to  be  vast  during  the  early  years  of  Turkey's  membership,  with  subsidies  alone  estimated  to  exceed  16.5bn  euros  and,  according  to  some  predictions,  balloon  to  33.5bn  euros.  This  would  include  vast  agricultural  subsidies  and  regional  aid,  though  such  payments  should  decline  as  the  country's  farm  sector,  which  currently  employs  one  in  three  Turks,  would  employ  just  one  in  five  by  2020.  |||    Such  high  initial  expenses  would  be  coupled  with  risks  that  the  benefits  flagged  up  by  Turkey's  government  would  never  be  delivered,  say  those  who  feel  the  Turkish  project  should  be  shunned.  |||    Some  fear  that  rather  than  providing  an  educated,  sophisticated  labour  force  for  Europe  at  large,  the  people  who  will  leave  Turkey  to  seek  work  abroad  will  be  poor,  uneducated  -  and  plentiful.  More  recently,  less  palatable  concerns  -  at  least  in  liberal  European  circles  -  have  been  voiced,  with  senior  EU  or  member  state  officials  talking  darkly  of  a  ""river  of  Islam"",  an  ""oriental""  culture  and  a  threat  to  Europe's  ""cultural  richness"".  Of  course,  many  opponents  are  politically  motivated  -  their  views  ranging  from  xenophobic  prejudices  about  the  country's  Muslim  traditions  to  well-documented  concerns  about  the  government's  human  rights  record.  Yet  their  economic  arguments  should  not  be  dismissed  out  of  hand.  |||    Critics  insist  that  much  of  the  optimism  about  Turkey's  economic  roadmap  has  been  over-egged  -  an  argument  amplified  by  a  134%  rise  in  the  country's  current  account  deficit  to  $10.7bn  during  the  first  10  months  of  this  year.  |||    The  country's  massive  debt  -  which  includes  $23bn  owed  to  the  IMF  and  billions  borrowed  via  the  international  bond  markets  -  also  remains  a  major  obstacle  to  its  ambition  of  joining  the  EU.  ""In  the  new  member  states  of  the  European  Union,  gross  public  debt  is  typically  about  40%  of  gross  domestic  product,""  says  Reza  Moghadam,  assistant  director  of  the  IMF's  European  Department.  ""At  about  80%  of  GDP,  Turkey's  gross  debt  is  double  that  figure.""  Turkey's  debts  have  largely  arisen  from  its  efforts  to  push  through  banking  reform  after  a  run  on  the  banks  in  2001  caused  the  country's  devastating  recession.  ""There  is  no  question  that  although  Turkey  is  doing  much  better  than  in  the  past,  it  remains  quite  vulnerable,""  says  Michael  Deppler,  director  of  the  IMF's  European  Department.  ""Its  debt  is  far  too  high  for  an  emerging  economy.""  A  key  factor  for  EU  decision  makers  should  be  whether  or  not  Turkey  has  met  its  economic  criteria.  But  economics  is  not  a  science.  And  although  the  state  of  Turkey's  economy  is  important,  as  is  its  pace  of  reform,  the  final  decision  on  17  December  will  be  taken  by  politicians  who  will,  of  course,  be  guided  by  their  political  instincts. "

2,"Voters  'don't  trust  politicians'  |||    Eight  out  of  10  voters  do  not  trust  politicians  to  tell  the  truth,  a  new  poll  conducted  for  the  BBC  suggests.  |||    And  87%  of  the  1,000  adults  quizzed  by  ICM  for  BBC  News  24  said  politicians  did  not  deliver  what  they  promised.  The  poll  comes  after  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  predicted  trust  would  be  ""the  key  choice""  at  the  next  election.  Both  the  Tories  and  the  Lib  Dems  are  keen  to  emphasise  a  perceived  lack  of  trust  in  Tony  Blair,  following  his  claims  over  Iraqi  weapons.  |||    But  according  to  the  BBC  poll,  61%  said  the  issue  of  trust  made  no  difference  to  whether  or  not  they  would  vote  at  the  next  election,  widely  expected  on  5  May.  The  poll  also  looked  at  what  lay  behind  the  lack  of  trust  in  politicians.  Some  87%  said  politicians  did  not  keep  the  promises  they  made  before  elections,  while  92%  said  they  never  gave  ""a  straight  answer"".  Just  under  three-quarters  of  respondents  (73%)  said  politicians  had  shown  themselves  to  be  dishonest  too  often.  |||    Mr  Straw  told  activists  in  Blackburn  on  Thursday  that  voters  would  have  to  decide  at  the  next  election  which  party  ""best  deserves""  their  ""future  trust"".  ""That  in  the  end  is  the  key  choice  at  the  next  election.""  |||    He  acknowledged  that  the  public  had  lost  faith  in  Labour,  but  suggested  it  could  persuade  people  to  ""reinvest  their  trust  with  us""  if  the  party  could  overcome  Tory  attempts  to  spread  cynicism  in  politics.  The  Conservatives  are  keen  to  highlight  the  trust  issue.  During  his  response  to  Gordon  Brown's  Budget  statement  on  Tuesday,  Michael  Howard  compared  the  chancellor's  figures  to  the  prime  minister's  claims  about  Iraq's  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  |||    The  Lib  Dems  are  also  keen  to  highlight  the  trust  issue,  with  Charles  Kennedy  has  claiming  voters  had  a  ""fundamental  lack  of  trust  in  the  prime  minister"".  And  the  Green  Party  unveiled  a  billboard  opposite  the  Palace  of  Westminster  accusing  the  government  of  lying  over  the  Iraq  war.  |||    Former  education  secretary  Estelle  Morris  told  BBC  News  24  that  there  was  a  ""real  problem  of  trust""  between  the  public  and  the  politicians.  She  said  she  did  not  feel  her  own  colleagues  could  be  trusted,  but  suggested  the  ""three-cornered  relationship""  between  the  press,  politicians  and  the  public  had  a  hand  in  the  issue.  The  public  was  often  turned  off  by  sitting  on  the  sidelines  in  ""the  battle  of  words""  between  the  politician  and  the  journalist,  she  added.  Lib  Dem  foreign  affairs  spokesman  Menzies  Campbell  said  the  Iraq  war  had  hit  trust  in  politicians  hard.  ""Issues  of  war  and  peace,  life  and  death  do  have  a  very  damaging  effect  on  the  credibility  of  politicians"".  Martin  Bell,  who  won  the  Tatton  seat  from  Tory  Neil  Hamilton  on  anti-corruption  platform,  said  politicians  often  failed  to  see  themselves  as  others  did.  ""We  need  public  figures  we  trust  to  tell  the  truth  and  who  can  see  themselves  as  others  see  them."" "

2,"Kennedy  begins  pre-election  tour  |||    Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  has  begun  a  week-long  tour  to  persuade  voters  they  are  the  ""real  opposition"".  |||    Mr  Kennedy  is  visiting  constituencies  in  Somerset  and  Hampshire  on  Monday  -  rural  seats  where  his  party  is  hoping  to  make  gains  from  the  Conservatives.  Later  he  will  visit  places,  such  as  Liverpool,  where  Labour  is  targeted.  Labour  say  a  Lib  Dem  vote  could  ""let  the  Tories  in"",  while  the  Tories  say  the  Lib  Dems  would  mean  ""higher  taxes,  soft  crime  laws,  more  power  to  Europe"".  Mr  Kennedy's  tour  comes  as  he,  Labour  leader  Tony  Blair  and  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard  all  step  up  campaigning  ahead  of  the  next  General  Election,  widely  expected  to  be  held  on  5  May.  On  Tuesday  Mr  Kennedy  will  visit  Leicester  South,  where  Lib  Dem  MP  Parmjit  Singh  Gill  overturned  a  big  Labour  majority  to  win  the  seat  in  last  year's  by-election.  |||    Stops  in  Shrewsbury,  North  Dorset,  Liverpool,  Manchester,  Basingstoke  and  west  London  are  planned  for  later  in  the  week.  The  Liberal  Democrats  say  in  the  northern  cities,  the  race  is  between  them  and  Labour,  while  in  southern  seats  -  particularly  the  south  west  -  it  is  between  them  and  the  Tories.  Speaking  to  the  BBC's  Westminster  Hour  on  Sunday,  Mr  Kennedy  said  the  upcoming  general  election  -  widely  tipped  for  5  May  -  would  be  much  more  unpredictable  than  any  others  in  ""recent  experience"".  Asked  whether  it  was  realistic  to  assume  the  Liberal  Democrats  could  win  the  general  election,  he  said:  ""There's  no  limit  to  the  ambitions  we  have  as  a  party.  ""But  we  have  got  to  be  responsible,  we  have  got  to  be  credible,  we  have  got  to  demonstrate  to  people  that  we  are  up  to  that  task.""  |||    Mr  Kennedy  said  the  British  public  felt  let  down  by  Labour  on  issues  from  Iraq  to  top-up  fees  and  the  Conservatives  were  not  ""asking  the  critical  questions"".  And  he  said  people  were  ""highly  sceptical""  about  Labour  and  Conservative  promises  on  tax.  But  he  brushed  off  Labour  suggestions  a  vote  for  his  party  would  mean  letting  the  Tories  in  ""by  the  back  door"".  ""If  you  look  at  the  four  previous  parliamentary  by-elections,  the  Liberal  Democrats  have  demonstrated  that,  not  only  can  we  leapfrog  the  Conservatives  where  we  start  in  a  third  place  position,  but  we  can  go  on  to  defeat  the  government.  ""That's  going  to  be  the  story,  I  think,  of  this  coming  general  election."" "

1,"Tautou  film  tops  Cesar  prize  nods  |||    French  film  A  Very  Long  Engagement  has  received  12  nominations  for  France's  Cesar  film  awards,  despite  a  recent  ruling  it  was  ""not  French  enough"".  |||    The  World  War  I  romantic  drama  starring  Audrey  Tautou,  was  recently  ruled  ""too  American""  by  a  Paris  court  as  it  was  partially  backed  by  Warner  Bros.  But  the  Cesar  organisers  modified  their  rules  to  allow  the  film  to  compete.  The  film,  directed  by  Jean-Pierre  Jeunet,  received  best  actress,  picture  and  director  nominations.  |||    Last  November  a  court  judged  the  film  was  too  American  to  compete  in  French  film  festivals.  Two  associations  of  French  producers  challenged  Jeunet's  right  to  French  government  subsidies,  because  Warner  Bros  was  a  backer.  The  ruling  meant  the  movie  -  which  was  filmed  in  France  and  used  French  actors  and  technicians  -  was  not  eligible  to  compete  for  French  prizes.  But  Alain  Terzian,  president  of  Cesar  organisers,  the  Academie  des  Arts  et  Techniques  du  Cinema,  said  the  changes  in  eligibility  rules,  which  allow  films  ""of  French  expression"",  were  made  three  months  prior  to  the  court  decision.  Other  films  in  the  best  film  category  include  Police  drama  36,  Quai  Des  Orfevres,  Arnaud  Desplechin's  Kings  And  Queen,  Abdellatif  Kechiche's  L'Esquive  and  France's  number  one  film  at  the  2004  box-office  The  Chorus.  |||    Best  actors  are  Daniel  Auteuil  for  36,  Mathieu  Amalric  for  Kings  And  Queen,  Gerard  Jugnot  for  The  Chorus,  Philippe  Torreton  for  L'Equipier  and  Benoit  Poelvoorde  for  Podium.  Tautou  will  compete  against  Maggie  Cheung  ,  Emmanuelle  Devos,  Yolande  Moreau  and  Karin  Viard  for  best  actress.  Michael  Moore's  Fahrenheit  9/11,  The  Motorcycle  Diaries,  Lost  in  Translation,  Eternal  Sunshine  of  the  Spotless  Mind  and  21  Grams  are  all  vying  in  the  best  foreign  film  prize.  The  awards  ceremony  will  be  held  on  26  February.  This  year,  Will  Smith,  star  of  I,  Robot,  Independence  Day  and  Men  In  Black,  will  be  given  an  honorary  Cesar,  along  with  French  singer/actor,  Jacques  Dutronc. "

1,"BBC  'should  allow  more  scrutiny'  |||    MPs  have  urged  the  BBC  to  give  watchdogs  more  freedom  to  scrutinise  how  £2bn  in  licence  fee  money  is  spent.  |||    The  Public  Accounts  Committee  called  for  the  National  Audit  Office  to  be  given  a  ""free  hand""  to  investigate  how  the  BBC  offers  value  for  money.  Although  six  areas  are  to  be  opened  up  to  scrutiny  the  audit  office  should  have  more  power  to  choose  what  it  investigated,  the  MPs  said.  The  call  was  made  in  a  report  into  the  BBC's  Freeview  digital  service.  ""Our  aim  is  not  to  rewrite  the  storyline  of  EastEnders  but  simply  to  ensure  that  the  BBC  is  as  accountable  to  parliament  as  any  other  organisation  spending  public  money,""  said  the  committee  chairman,  MP  Edward  Leigh.  ""The  BBC's  spending  is  not  subject  to  the  full  independent  scrutiny,  and  accountability  to  parliament.  ""Parliament  requires  television  owners  to  pay  a  licence  fee  and  expects  the  comptroller  and  auditor  general,  on  behalf  of  parliament,  to  be  able  to  scrutinise  how  that  money,  over  £2  billion  a  year,  is  used.""  |||    A  BBC  spokeswoman  said:  ""We  share  the  committee's  interest  in  ensuring  the  public  money  we  receive  is  spent  well.  Though  in  its  infancy,  we  think  the  arrangements  with  the  NAO  are  working  well  and  should  be  given  time  to  mature.""  The  report  said  the  Freeview  digital  service  has  had  an  ""impressive""  take  up  since  its  launch  but  the  BBC  must  still  dispel  confusion  about  the  service.  The  committee  found  the  BBC  had  succeeded  in  ensuring  subscription-free  access  to  digital  channels  following  the  collapse  of  ITV  Digital  in  2002.  But  the  fact  that  one  in  four  homes  could  not  access  Freeview  remained  a  problem.  |||    The  report  said  that  while  gaps  in  the  coverage  were  largely  due  to  landscape  issues,  there  was  need  for  detailed  explanations  on  the  Freeview  website  and  on  promotional  literature  as  to  why  it  was  not  available  in  specific  areas.  The  government  has  proposed  switch  off  of  the  analogue  television  signal,  with  2012  the  most  recently  proposed  date.  The  BBC  launched  Freeview  in  2002  as  an  alternative  to  satellite  subscription  services  such  as  Sky,  to  allow  its  digital  channels  such  as  BBC  Three  and  News  24  to  be  seen.  There  have  been  an  estimated  five  million  Freeview  set-top  boxes  sold  since  the  launch  and  prices  have  fallen  considerably.  The  corporation  plans  to  spend  up  to  £138m  on  Freeview  before  2014  to  ensure  people  can  receive  the  service  throughout  the  UK,  and  are  aware  of  it. "

1,"Buffy  creator  joins  Wonder  Woman  |||    The  creator  of  Buffy  the  Vampire  Slayer  is  to  take  on  a  new  female  superhero  after  signing  up  to  write  and  direct  the  Wonder  Woman  movie.  |||    Joss  Whedon  described  the  DC  Comics  character  as  ""the  most  iconic  female  heroine  of  our  time"".  ""In  a  way,  no  one  has  met  her  yet,""  he  said.  ""What  I  love  most  about  icons  is  finding  out  what's  behind  them,  exploring  the  price  of  their  power.""  Linda  Carter  played  the  character  in  the  1970s  TV  series.  The  character  of  Wonder  Woman,  famed  for  her  red  and  gold  costume,  was  born  on  Paradise  Island,  and  was  blessed  with  the  powers  of  strength  and  flight.  The  film  is  being  produced  by  Joel  Silver,  producer  of  the  Matrix  trilogy.  |||    ""There's  no  one  better  than  Joss  to  adapt  the  legendary  Wonder  Woman  comic  book  character  created  in  the  1940s  into  a  dynamic  feature  film  for  21st  Century  audiences,""  said  Silver.  ""Wonder  Woman  was  the  first  great  female  superhero  to  emerge  from  comic  books  and  later  inspire  millions  of  fans  in  her  television  incarnation...  but  this  groundbreaking  heroine  has  yet  to  be  reinvented  for  the  feature  film  arena.""  Whedon  created  the  character  of  Buffy  in  the  screenplay  for  the  1992  film.  He  distanced  himself  from  the  movie  because  of  the  direction  it  eventually  took,  and  the  film  bombed.  But  he  did  not  give  up  on  the  Slayer  and  went  on  to  write  and  executive  produce  seven  seasons  of  the  cult  TV  series.  He  also  produced  the  spin-off  Angel  series.  He  is  currently  directing  the  film  Serenity,  based  on  his  short-lived  sci-fi  series  Firefly. "

2,"Bid  to  cut  court  witness  stress  |||    New  targets  to  reduce  the  stress  to  victims  and  witnesses  giving  evidence  in  courts  in  England  and  Wales  have  been  announced  by  the  lord  chancellor.  |||    Lord  Falconer  wants  all  crown  courts  and  90%  of  magistrates'  courts  to  have  facilities  to  keep  witnesses  separate  from  defendants  within  four  years.  More  video  links  will  also  be  made  available  so  that  witnesses  do  not  have  to  enter  courtrooms.  It  is  part  of  a  five-year  plan  to  help  build  confidence  in  the  justice  system.  |||    Ministers  say  the  strategy  is  aimed  at  re-balancing  the  court  system  towards  victims,  and  increasing  the  number  of  offenders  brought  to  justice.  Launching  the  Department  for  Constitutional  Affairs'  plan,  Lord  Falconer  said:  ""One  of  the  top  priorities  will  be  a  better  deal  for  victims.  ""The  needs  and  safety  of  victims  will  be  at  the  heart  of  the  way  trials  are  managed.  |||    ""Courts,  judges,  magistrates,  prosecutors,  police  and  victim  support  -  all  working  together  to  ensure  the  rights  of  victims  are  put  first,  without  compromising  the  rights  of  the  defendant.""  He  went  on:  ""Giving  evidence  is  a  nerve-wracking  experience,  especially  when  you're  a  victim.  ""Yet  with  a  will  and  with  support  it  can  be  done.""  Lord  Falconer  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme  it  was  impossible  for  some  elderly  people  to  go  to  court  to  give  evidence.  Other  witnesses  could  be  intimidated  by  sitting  alongside  defendants  outside  courts.  ""You  are  never  going  to  get  rid  of  some  element  of  the  trauma  of  giving  evidence,""  he  said.  ""But  you  can  make  people  believe  that  the  courts  understand  the  problem,  it's  not  some  kind  of  alien  place  where  they  go  where  they  are  not  thinking  about  them.""  |||    The  plan  comes  as  the  lord  chancellor  also  considers  allowing  cameras  into  courts  for  the  first  time  since  1925,  as  long  as  they  were  used  for  cases  that  did  not  involve  witnesses.  Another  feature  of  the  strategy  is  constitutional  reform,  with  a  government  bill  to  set  up  a  supreme  court  and  a  judicial  appointments  commission  returning  to  the  House  of  Lords  on  Tuesday.  Ministers  had  proposed  getting  rid  of  the  title  of  lord  chancellor,  but  the  Lords  have  over-ruled  this.  Lord  Falconer  said  it  was  right  for  the  highest  court  to  be  completely  distinct  from  Parliament.  The  person  in  charge  of  the  court  system  should  not  also  be  speaker  of  the  House  of  Lords,  he  said,  and  should  be  the  best  person  chosen  from  either  House  of  Parliament.  What  they  did,  not  what  they  were  called,  was  the  critical  issue,  he  added. "

2,"Kennedy's  cautious  optimism  |||    Charles  Kennedy  is  far  too  canny  to  make  any  grand  claims  about  how  his  party  may  fare  at  the  general  election.  |||    In  his  22  years  in  the  Commons,  he  has  seen  his  fair  share  of  such  claims  dashed  on  the  rocks  of  bitter  experience  and,  he  might  say,  the  UK's  political  and  electoral  system.  But  even  his  caution  cannot  hide  the  fact  that  this  is  a  party  and  a  leader  that  believes  it  may  well  be  on  the  way  to  something  special  in  a  few  months'  time.  ""Look,  I  have  already  said  I  am  not  going  to  put  any  artificial  limits  on  our  ambitions  this  time  around,""  he  said.  He  still  seems  to  accept  that  the  most  likely  outcome  is  another  Labour  victory  of  some  sort.  And  his  general  election  pitch  is  designed  around  the  notion  of  the  Lib  Dems  as  the  ""real""  opposition.  |||    But  doesn't  that  lead  to  the  jibe  that  his  is  a  party  actively  bidding  to  come  second?  He  is  prepared  to  go  this  far:  ""A  clear  conclusion  has  been  reached,  including  by  Conservatives,  that  the  Conservatives  are  not  going  to  win  this  election.  ""Therefore  the  potential  is  there  for  the  Liberal  Democrat  advance  to  be  one  of  the  big  stories  of  the  election,  given  that  we  have  the  capacity  to  take  on  Labour  and  win  as  well  as  take  on  the  Conservatives  and  win.  ""This  is  really  going  to  be  the  first  modern  three  party  UK  election  that  we  have  all  experienced"".  But  haven't  we  been  here  before,  with  suggestions  in  the  1980s  that  Labour  was  finished.  Won't  voters  looking  for  an  alternative  to  Labour  still  naturally  gravitate  to  the  Conservatives?  ""The  problem  is  that,  geographically,  the  Conservative  party  has  melted  away  in  about  a  third  of  Britain.  ""We  have  supplanted  them  as  the  main  alternative  to  Labour  in  whole  tracts  of  mainland  Britain.  And  they  are  a  party  with  an  ageing  and  declining  membership  base  and  they  just  do  not  look  vibrant  or  vital  or  in  touch  any  longer  with  contemporary  Britain"".  |||    Mr  Kennedy  is  also  eager  to  dispel  any  impression  his  party  is  the  new  party  of  the  left  and  is  likely  to  attract  mostly  disillusioned  Labour  voters.  |||    He  insists  his  three  headline  commitments,  to  be  financed  from  a  1%  tax  increase  on  those  earning  over  £100,000  a  year,  will  appeal  right  across  the  political  spectrum.  They  are  to  replace  the  council  tax  with  a  local  income  tax,  provide  free  long  term  care  for  the  elderly  and  scrap  student  fees.  He  also  believes  being  the  only  major  party  promising  to  increases  taxes  will  not  land  him  in  the  same  trouble  a  similar  policy  did  to  Old  Labour.  ""I  think  the  tax  argument  has  moved  on  a  lot  in  British  politics  particularly  in  the  context  of  the  forthcoming  general  election,""  he  said.  Under  a  Labour  government  the  tax  burden  would  have  to  rise,  while  the  Tories'  plans  to  increase  spending  in  some  areas  while  also  reducing  taxes  is  just  incredible,  he  claims.  |||    ""We  are  being  straightforward  with  people,  saying  you  know  there  is  likely  to  be  an  increase  in  the  tax  burden,  we  are  only  recommending  one  specific  tax  rise  for  the  top  end  of  income  scale  earners  to  fund  three  specific  policies"".  |||    ""That  is  a  clear  cut  choice  for  people,  one  I  am  very  comfortable  with  and  I  think  will  distinguish  us  from  the  others"".  As  to  his  own  future,  he  is  clear.  If,  as  expected,  his  party  increases  its  showing  at  the  election,  he  intends  to  go  into  the  next  parliament  ""on  the  front  foot  with  a  view  to  leading  it  right  through  that  parliament  into  the  next  election  because  I  see  that  as  the  decisive  opportunity  for  us"".  That  last  remark  reflects  a  view  gaining  ground  in  Westminster  that,  if  the  Tories  do  as  badly  as  some  fear,  the  election  after  next  might  really  see  that  historic  breakthrough  by  the  third  party.  Perhaps  then  Mr  Kennedy  will  be  ready  to  put  some  of  the  caution  to  one  side. "

0,"Glaxo  aims  high  after  profit  fall  |||    GlaxoSmithKline  saw  its  profits  fall  9%  last  year  to  £6.2bn  ($11.5bn),  but  Europe's  biggest  drugmaker  says  a  recovery  during  2005  is  on  the  way.  |||    Cheap  copies  of  its  drugs,  particularly  anti-depressants  Paxil  and  Wellbutrin,  and  a  weak  dollar  had  hit  profits,  but  global  sales  were  up  1%  in  2004.  The  firm  is  confident  its  new  drug  pipeline  will  deliver  profits  despite  the  failure  of  an  obesity  drug.  Chief  executive  Jean-Pierre  Garnier  said  it  had  been  a  ""difficult  year"".  |||    In  early  afternoon  trade  in  London  the  company  share  price  was  down  1%  at  1218  pence.  Mr  Garnier  said  the  company  had  absorbed  over  £1.5bn  of  lost  sales  to  generics  but  still  managing  to  grow  the  business.  ""The  continuing  success  of  our  key  products  means  we  can  now  look  forward  to  a  good  performance  in  2005,""  he  said.  ""2005  will  also  be  an  important  year  in  terms  of  research  and  development  pipeline  progress.""  However,  the  firm  discontinued  development  of  an  experimental  treatment  for  obesity,  known  as  '771,  after  disappointing  clinical  trial  results.  Glaxo  is  relying  on  new  treatments  for  conditions  such  as  cancer,  diabetes,  depression,  HIV/AIDS  and  allergies  to  lift  the  pace  of  sales  growth  after  several  disappointing  years.

0,"Yukos  bankruptcy  'not  US  matter'  |||    Russian  authorities  do  not  have  to  abide  by  any  US  court  decisions  taken  with  regard  to  troubled  oil  giant  Yukos,  a  Houston  court  has  been  told.  |||    Legal  expert  William  Butler  said  there  was  no  treaty  between  the  US  and  Russia  to  recognise  the  other's  legal  rulings.  That  meant  Moscow  would  not  have  to  adhere  to  US  rulings  in  the  Yukos  case.  Yukos  says  a  US  court  was  entitled  to  declare  it  bankrupt  before  its  Yugansk  unit  was  sold,  since  it  has  a  US  subsidiary  and  local  bank  accounts.  |||    Yukos  made  its  surprise  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  filing  in  Houston  in  December  in  an  unsuccessful  attempt  to  halt  the  auction  of  Yugansk,  its  main  oil  producing  unit,  by  Russian  authorities.  Yugansk  was  sold  to  help  pay  off  a  $27.5bn  (£14.5bn)  back  tax  bill.  It  was  bought  for  $9.4bn  by  a  previously  unknown  group,  which  was  in  turn  bought  by  state-controlled  oil  company  Rosneft.  The  US  court's  jurisdiction  has  been  challenged  by  Deutsche  Bank  and  Gazpromneft,  a  former  unit  of  Russian  gas  monopoly  Gazprom  which  is  due  to  merge  with  Rosneft.  Deutsche  Bank  maintains  the  case  has  no  place  in  a  US  court  because  Yukos  has  no  assets  in  the  US,  apart  from  two  bank  accounts  and  a  house  in  Houston  owned  by  its  chief  finance  officer  Bruce  Misamore.  Deutsche  Bank  is  involved  in  the  case  because  it  is  itself  being  sued  by  Yukos.  It  had  agreed  to  loan  Gazpromneft  the  money  to  bid  for  Yugansk.  US  bankruptcy  judge  Letitia  Clark,  who  issued  an  injunction  in  December  to  try  and  prevent  the  Yugansk  sale,  has  said  she  will  rule  ""pretty  promptly,  however  I  do  not  anticipate  ruling  on  it  before  next  Tuesday"".  |||    Yukos  has  claimed  it  sought  help  in  the  US  because  other  forums  -  Russian  courts  and  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  -  were  either  unfriendly  or  offered  less  protection.  It  has  claimed  that  Russia  imposed  the  huge  tax  bill  and  forced  the  sale  of  Yugansk  as  part  of  a  campaign  to  destroy  Yukos  and  its  former  owner  Mihkail  Khodorkovsky,  who  is  facing  a  10-year  prison  term  in  Russia  for  fraud  and  tax  evasion.  Yukos'  parent  company,  the  Gibraltar-based  Menatep  Group,  is  suing  Russia  in  Europe  for  $28.3bn  in  financial  damages.  The  company  is  also  seeking  $20bn  in  a  separate  US  lawsuit  against  Rosneft  and  Gazprom  for  their  role  in  the  sale  of  Yugansk. "

2,"Lib  Dems  stress  Budget  trust  gap  |||    Public  trust  in  the  handling  of  the  economy  can  only  be  restored  if  Gordon  Brown  opens  up  his  books  for  unbiased  inspection,  say  the  Lib  Dems.  |||    City  experts  say  there  is  a  £10bn  ""black  hole""  in  the  public  finances,  a  claim  denied  by  the  chancellor.  Lib  Dem  spokesman  Vince  Cable  said  the  public  did  not  know  who  to  believe  and  the  National  Audit  Office  should  judge.  Responding  to  the  pre-Budget  report,  Mr  Cable  also  attacked  Labour's  ""unfair""  and  over-complicated  taxes.  |||    In  his  report,  Mr  Brown  insisted  he  was  on  course  to  meet  his  ""golden  rule""  of  borrowing  only  to  invest,  rather  than  for  day-to-day  spending,  over  the  course  of  the  economic  cycle.  Mr  Cable  said  people  did  not  know  whether  to  believe  the  chancellor  or  the  consensus  among  experts  which  said  the  rule  would  be  broken.  ""There  is  an  issue  of  credibility  and  trust,""  he  said.  ""We  cannot  have  a  continuation  of  a  situation  where  the  chancellor  sets  his  own  tests  and  then  marks  them.  ""What  we  need  is  the  equivalent  of  a  thorough  Ofsted  inspection  of  the  government's  accounts.""  He  asked  what  the  government  had  to  hide.  |||    Mr  Cable  also  accused  the  chancellor  of  ducking  tough  choices.  He  argued:  ""There  are  serious  challenges  ahead  from  the  falling  dollar  and  from  the  rapid  downturn  in  the  UK  housing  market  and  rising  personal  debt.  But  they  have  not  been  confronted.""  Mr  Brown  confirmed  he  was  setting  aside  another  £520m  for  the  conflicts  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  Mr  Cable  compared  that  new  cost  with  the  £500m  needed  for  Britain's  role  in  the  entire  first  Gulf  War  -  when  80%  of  the  bill  had  been  met  through  help  from  European  and  Arab  nations.  He  suggested  keeping  British  troops  in  Iraq  could  cost  another  £1bn  with  the  government  also  planning  to  spend  at  least  £3bn  for  identity  cards.  The  current  economic  climate  meant  Britain  could  not  afford  the  ""reckless,  George  Bush-style  tax  cutting  spree""  planned  by  the  Tories,  he  said.  Instead,  what  was  needed  was  simple  and  fair  taxation  rather  than  the  ""complete  mess""  produced  by  Mr  Brown's  endless  tinkering.  |||    Mr  Cable  said  40%  of  all  pensioners  were  now  paying  marginal  tax  rates  of  50%.  And  one-and-a-half  million  hard  working  families  were  paying  60%  marginal  tax  rates.  With  that  record,  he  asked  why  ministers  attacked  Lib  Dem  plans  for  a  new  50%  tax  rate  for  the  ""very  rich""  -  those  earning  more  than  £100,000  a  year.  Mr  Brown  earmarked  £1bn  to  help  keep  down  council  tax  rises  next  year.  But  the  Lib  Dem  spokesman  questioned  whether  that  money  was  being  found  from  cuts  to  education  and  health.  He  urged  the  government  to  scrap  the  ""grossly  unfair""  tax  completely.  The  Lib  Dems  want  it  replaced  with  a  local  income  tax.  In  response,  Mr  Brown  stressed  the  Iraq  money  came  from  a  reserve  funds.  It  was  because  he  had  rejected  previous  Lib  Dem  proposals,  such  as  scrapping  the  New  Deal,  that  Britain's  economy  was  successful,  claimed  Mr  Brown. "

2,"Brown  visits  slum  on  Africa  trip  |||    Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  has  visited  Kenya's  biggest  shantytown  as  he  opened  a  week-long  visit  to  Africa.  |||    Mr  Brown's  trip  is  designed  to  highlight  how  the  UK  wants  to  make  Africa's  problems  a  priority  of  its  chairmanship  of  the  G8  this  year.  He  will  see  an  HIV/Aids  orphanage  in  Tanzania  and  a  women's  credit  union  in  Mozambique  before  chairing  a  meeting  of  the  Commission  for  Africa  in  Cape  Town.  At  slums  in  Narobi  on  Wednesday,  he  said  education  needs  had  to  be  tackled.  |||    Speaking  outside  the  Olympic  Primary  School,  Mr  Brown  said:  ""It  is  simply  not  acceptable  in  the  modern  age  for  the  rest  of  the  world  to  stand  by  and  have  hundreds  of  millions  of  children  not  getting  the  chance  at  education.""  He  pointed  to  international  plans  to  invest  $10bn  for  education  in  Africa  over  the  next  decade.  The  school  is  on  the  edge  of  Kibera,  where  800,000  live  often  in  huts  made  of  mud,  scrap  metal  and  cardboard.  Mr  Brown's  aides  say  he  wants  to  find  out  more  about  the  Kenyan  Government's  education  policies,  which  included  introducing  free  primary  education  in  early  2003.  The  chancellor  has  already  unveiled  proposals  for  a  G8  aid  package  which  he  has  likened  to  the  Marshall  Plan  used  by  the  United  States  to  rebuild  Europe  after  World  War  Two.  The  trip  follows  claims  of  infighting  between  Mr  Brown  and  Tony  Blair  detailed  in  a  new  book.  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard  is  expected  to  seize  on  those  reports  at  prime  minister's  questions  at  1200  GMT  on  Wednesday. "

2,"Labour  seeks  to  quell  feud  talk  |||    Labour's  leadership  put  on  a  show  of  unity  at  a  campaign  poster  launch  after  MPs  criticised  Tony  Blair  and  Gordon  Brown  over  reports  of  their  rift.  |||    Mr  Brown  was  joined  at  the  launch  by  John  Prescott  and  Alan  Milburn,  the  man  controversially  put  in  charge  of  election  planning  by  Mr  Blair.  A  private  meeting  on  Monday  saw  normally  loyal  MPs  warn  that  feuding  could  jeopardise  their  election  hopes.  It  follows  a  new  book  charting  disputes  between  prime  minister  and  chancellor.  |||    The  event  was  the  first  time  Mr  Milburn  has  shared  a  platform  with  the  chancellor  since  taking  Mr  Brown's  traditional  poll  planning  role.  But  the  pair  chatted  amicably  and  Mr  Brown  insisted  he  was  happy  with  his  current  campaign  task.  Asked  about  how  he  would  deal  with  claims  that  he  did  not  trust  the  prime  minister,  Mr  Brown  replied:  ""You  can  see  that  our  record  on  the  economy  is  about  the  British  people  trusting  us  to  run  the  economy.""  |||    He  refused  to  comment  on  the  new  book,  saying  nobody  should  be  distracted  from  the  business  of  government.  Mr  Brown  later  told  reporters:  ""Of  course  I  trust  the  prime  minister.""  Downing  Street  cited  that  comment  when  reporters'  suggested  Mr  Brown  had  pointedly  failed  to  deny  claims  he  had  once  told  Mr  Blair:  ""There  is  nothing  you  could  ever  say  to  me  now  that  I  could  ever  believe"".  Labour's  new  posters  say  Britain  is  enjoying  the  lowest  inflation  since  the  1960s,  lowest  unemployment  for  29  years  and  the  lowest  mortgage  rates  for  40  years.  They  urge  voters  not  to  let  the  Tories  take  things  backwards.  Mr  Milburn  promised  a  poll  campaign  ""which  is  upbeat,  confident  and  above  all  else  optimistic  about  the  future  of  our  country"".  |||    Conservative  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  derided  the  photo  call,  saying:  ""The  show  of  unity  was  the  worst  acting  I  have  seen  since  Prisoner  Cell  Block  H.""  Labour  had  broken  promises  by  raising  taxes  66  times  and  brought  the  slowest  economic  growth  in  the  English-speaking  world,  he  said.  |||    The  prime  minister  and  chancellor  faced  backbench  discontent  at  Monday's  meeting  of  the  Parliamentary  Labour  Party  over  claims  made  in  journalist  Robert  Peston's  new  book.  Mr  Blair  told  MPs  and  peers:  ""I  know  from  everyone  here,  in  Cabinet  and  government,  nothing  is  going  to  get  in  the  way  of  a  unified  Labour  Party  with  a  unified  position  and  winning  the  third  term  people  desperately  need.""  Labour's  Paul  Flynn  said  the  pair  had  had  a  ""scorching""  from  MPs.  |||    On  Tuesday,  deputy  prime  minister  Mr  Prescott  told  BBC  News:  ""They  told  us  very  clearly,  it  was  the  troops  telling  the  leaders:  get  in  line.""  The  new  book  claims  Mr  Prescott  hosted  a  dinner  in  November  2003  where  the  prime  minister  told  Mr  Brown  he  would  stand  down  before  the  next  election  because  he  had  lost  trust  over  the  Iraq  war.  Mr  Blair  then  changed  his  mind  in  June  2004,  after  Cabinet  allies  intervened  and  amid  suspicion  the  chancellor  was  manoeuvring  against  him,  writes  Mr  Peston.  Mr  Prescott  said  there  was  a  dinner  but  the  discussions  were  confidential.  ""Of  course  as  a  waiter  for  10  years  I  have  a  professional  ability  here,""  he  joked. "

0,"Cash  gives  way  to  flexible  friend  |||    Spending  on  credit  and  debit  cards  has  overtaken  cash  spending  in  the  UK  for  the  first  time.  |||    The  moment  that  plastic  finally  toppled  cash  happened  at  10.38am  on  Wednesday,  according  to  the  Association  for  Payment  Clearing  Services  (Apacs)  Apacs  chose  school  teacher  Helen  Carroll,  from  Portsmouth,  to  make  the  historic  transaction.  The  switch  over  took  place  as  she  paid  for  her  groceries  in  the  supermarket  chain  Tesco's  Cromwell  Road  branch.  |||    Mrs  Carroll  was  born  in  the  same  year  that  plastic  cards  first  appeared  in  the  UK.  ""I  pay  for  most  things  with  my  debit  card,  with  occasional  purchases  on  one  of  my  credit  cards,""  said  Mrs  Carroll,  who  teaches  at  Peel  Common  Infants  School  in  Gosport.  |||    Spending  patterns  for  the  year  and  estimates  for  December  led  Apacs  to  conclude  that  10.38am  was  the  time  that  plastic  would  finally  rule  the  roost.  Shoppers  in  the  UK  are  expected  to  put  £269bn  on  plastic  cards  during  the  whole  of  2004,  compared  with  £268bn  paid  with  cash,  Apacs  said.  When  the  first  plastic  cards  appeared  in  the  UK  in  June  1966,  issued  by  Barclaycard,  but  only  a  handful  of  retailers  accepted  them  and  very  few  customers  held  them.  ""But  in  less  than  40  years,  plastic  has  become  our  most  popular  way  to  pay,  due  to  the  added  security  and  flexibility  it  offers,""  said  Apacs  spokeswoman  Jemma  Smith.  ""The  key  driver  has  been  the  introduction  of  debit  cards,  which  now  account  for  two-thirds  of  plastic  card  transactions  and  are  used  by  millions  of  us  every  day."" "

1,"Spears  seeks  aborted  tour  payment  |||    Singer  Britney  Spears  is  suing  eight  insurance  companies  that  have  refused  to  reimburse  her  for  cancelling  her  2004  world  tour.  |||    The  pop  star  cancelled  her  Onyx  Hotel  tour  last  June  after  suffering  a  knee  injury  during  a  video  shoot.  She  is  now  seeking  to  be  reimbursed  for  the  tour's  £5m  ($9.3m)  costs  in  a  claim  filed  at  New  York  State  Supreme  Court.  Seven  London-based  companies  and  an  eighth  Paris  firm  have  been  given  up  to  30  days  to  respond  to  the  complaint.  |||    The  22-year-old  star  initially  missed  a  number  of  shows  on  the  82-date  tour  after  injuring  her  knee  during  a  show  in  Illinois  last  March.  But  she  was  rushed  to  hospital  and  needed  surgery  after  a  later  incident  while  filming  a  video  for  her  song  Outrageous,  leading  her  to  cancel  the  rest  of  the  tour,  including  dates  in  China.  ""She  obviously  took  a  wrong  step  and  blew  out  her  knee,""  a  Jive  spokeswoman  said  at  the  time.  ""It  was  an  old  dance  injury.""  The  legal  submission  described  Spears  as  ""one  of  the  most  recognised  performers  in  her  industry"".  The  Onyx  Hotel  tour  was  cited  as  ""a  highly  crafted  production  which  included  the  well-known  music  and  dancing  of  Spears,  supported  by  elaborate  costumes,  complex  choreography  as  well  as  cutting-edge  video  production,  lighting  and  other  effects"".  In  September  Spears  married  Kevin  Federline,  who  had  been  a  dancer  on  the  aborted  tour. "

0,"The  'ticking  budget'  facing  the  US  |||    The  budget  proposals  laid  out  by  the  administration  of  US  President  George  W  Bush  are  highly  controversial.  The  Washington-based  Economic  Policy  Institute,  which  tends  to  be  critical  of  the  President,  looks  at  possible  fault  lines.  US  politicians  and  citizens  of  all  political  persuasions  are  in  for  a  dose  of  shock  therapy.  Without  major  changes  in  current  policies  and  political  prejudices,  the  federal  budget  simply  cannot  hold  together.  News  coverage  of  the  Bush  budget  will  be  dominated  by  debates  about  spending  cuts,  but  the  fact  is  these  will  be  large  cuts  in  small  programs.  From  the  standpoint  of  the  big  fiscal  trends,  the  cuts  are  gratuitous  and  the  big  budget  train  wreck  is  yet  to  come.  Under  direct  threat  will  be  the  federal  government's  ability  to  make  good  on  its  debts  to  the  Social  Security  Trust  Fund.  As  soon  as  2018,  the  fund  will  begin  to  require  some  cash  returns  on  its  bond  holdings  in  order  to  finance  all  promised  benefits.  |||    The  trigger  for  the  coming  shock  will  be  rising  federal  debt,  which  will  grow  in  10  years,  by  conservative  estimates,  to  more  than  half  the  nation's  total  annual  output.  |||    This  upward  trend  will  force  increased  borrowing  by  the  federal  government,  putting  upward  pressure  on  interest  rates  faced  by  consumers  and  business.  Even  now,  a  growing  share  of  US  borrowing  is  from  abroad.  The  US  Government  cannot  finance  its  operations  without  heavy  borrowing  from  the  central  banks  of  Japan  and  China,  among  other  nations.  This  does  not  bode  well  for  US  influence  in  the  world.  The  decline  of  the  dollar  is  a  warning  sign  that  current  economic  trends  cannot  continue.  The  dollar  is  already  sinking.  Before  too  long,  credit  markets  are  likely  to  react,  and  interest  rates  will  creep  upwards.  That  will  be  the  shock.  |||    Interest-sensitive  industries  will  feel  pain  immediately  -  sectors  such  as  housing,  automobiles,  other  consumer  durables,  agriculture,  and  small  business.  Some  will  recall  the  news  footage  of  angry  farmers  driving  their  heavy  equipment  around  the  US  Capitol  in  the  late  1970s.  There  will  be  no  need  for  constitutional  amendments  to  balance  the  budget.  The  public  outcry  will  force  Congress  to  act.  Whether  it  will  act  wisely  is  another  matter.  How  did  this  happen?  |||    By  definition,  the  deficit  means  too  little  revenue  and  too  much  spending  -  but  this  neutral  description  doesn't  adequately  capture  the  current  situation.  Federal  revenues  are  at  1950s  levels,  while  spending  remains  where  it  has  been  in  recent  decades  -  much  higher.  In  addition,  the  United  States  has  two  significant  military  missions.  The  Bush  administration's  chosen  remedy  is  the  least  feasible  one.  Reducing  domestic  spending,  or  eliminating  ""waste,  fraud  and  abuse""  is  toothless  because  this  slice  of  the  budget  is  too  small  to  solve  the  problem.  Indeed,  if  Congress  were  rash  enough  to  balance  the  budget  in  this  way,  there  would  hardly  be  any  such  spending  left.  Law  enforcement,  space  exploration,  environmental  clean-up,  economic  development,  the  Small  Business  Administration,  housing,  veterans'  benefits,  aid  to  state  and  local  governments  would  all  but  disappear.  It's  fantasy  to  think  these  routine  government  functions  could  be  slashed.  The  biggest  spending  growth  areas  are  defence  (including  homeland  security),  and  health  care  for  the  elderly  and  the  poor.  To  some  extent,  increases  in  these  areas  are  inevitable.  The  US  population  is  aging,  and  the  nation  does  face  genuine  threats  in  the  world.  But  serious  savings  can  only  be  found  where  the  big  money  is.  Savings  in  health  care  spending  that  do  not  come  at  the  expense  of  health  can  only  be  achieved  with  wholesale  reform  of  the  entire  system,  public  and  private.  Brute  force  budget  cuts  or  spending  caps  would  ill-serve  the  nation's  elderly  and  indigent.  |||    On  the  revenue  side,  the  lion's  share  of  revenue  lost  to  tax  cuts  enacted  since  2000  will  have  to  be  replaced.  |||    Some  rearranging  could  hold  many  people  harmless  and  focus  most  of  the  pain  on  those  with  relatively  high  incomes.  Finally,  blind  allegiance  to  a  balanced  budget  will  have  to  be  abandoned.  There  is  no  good  reason  to  fixate  on  it,  anyway.  Moderate  deficits  and  slowly  rising  federal  debt  can  be  sustained  indefinitely.  Borrowing  for  investments  in  education  and  infrastructure  that  pay  off  in  future  years  makes  sense.  The  sooner  we  face  that  reality,  the  sooner  workable  reforms  can  be  pursued.  First  on  the  list  should  be  tax  reform  to  raise  revenue,  simplify  the  tax  code,  and  restore  some  fairness  eroded  by  the  Bush  tax  cuts.  Second  should  be  a  dispassionate  re-evaluation  of  the  huge  increase  in  defence  spending  over  the  past  three  years,  much  of  it  unrelated  to  Afghanistan,  Iraq,  or  terrorism.  Third  must  be  the  start  of  a  serious  debate  on  large-scale  health  care  reform.  One  thing  is  certain  -  destroying  the  budget  in  order  to  save  it  is  not  going  to  equip  the  US  economy  and  government  for  the  challenges  of  this  new  century. "

3,"Spurs  to  sign  Iceland  U21  star  |||    Tottenham  are  primed  to  snap  up  Iceland  Under-21  international  Emil  Hallfredsson  after  he  impressed  on  trial  at  White  Hart  Lane.  |||    The  20-year-old  midfielder,  who  plays  for  FH  Hafnarfjordur,  also  starred  in  the  Uefa  Cup  match  against  Scottish  side  Dunfermline  earlier  this  season.  Spurs  have  agreed  a  fee  for  the  player,  who  has  yet  to  agree  personal  terms.  ""He  had  offers  from  two  other  clubs  but  he  decided  to  come  to  Tottenham,""  said  Spurs  sporting  director  Frank  Arnesen.  ""He  is  a  left-sided  player,  a  position  we  have  been  looking  at  and  he  showed  so  much  talent  in  his  time  here  that  we  decided  to  take  him.  ""It's  down  the  road  of  bringing  in  talent,  good  prospects  and  giving  them  a  place  at  Tottenham  where  they  can  improve."" "

The  currency  has  gained  almost  1%  in  the  past  three  sessions.  S&P,  which  rates  borrowers'  creditworthiness,  lifted  India's  rating  by  one  notch  to  'BB+'.  With  Indian  assets  now  seen  as  less  of  a  gamble,  more  cash  is  expected  to  flow  into  its  markets,  buoying  the  rupee.  |||    ""The  upgrade  is  positive  and  basically  people  will  use  it  as  an  excuse  to  come  back  to  India,""  said  Bhanu  Baweja,  a  strategist  at  UBS.  ""Money  has  moved  out  from  India  in  the  first  two  or  three  weeks  of  January  into  other  markets  like  Korea  and  Thailand  and  this  upgrade  should  lead  to  a  reversal.""  India's  foreign  currency  rating  is  now  one  notch  below  investment  grade,  which  starts  at  'BBB-'.  The  increase  has  put  it  on  the  same  level  as  Romania,  Egypt  and  El  Salvador,  and  one  level  below  Russia. "

0,"Shares  rise  on  new  Man  Utd  offer  |||    Shares  in  Manchester  United  closed  up  4.75%  on  Monday  following  a  new  offer  from  US  tycoon  Malcolm  Glazer.  |||    The  board  of  the  football  club  is  expected  to  meet  early  this  week  to  discuss  the  latest  proposal,  which  values  the  club  at  £800m  ($1.5bn).  Manchester  United  revealed  on  Sunday  that  it  had  received  a  detailed  proposal  from  Mr  Glazer,  which  looks  set  to  receive  more  serious  scrutiny.  The  club  has  previously  rejected  Mr  Glazer's  approaches  out  of  hand.  But  a  senior  source  at  the  club  told  the  BBC:  ""This  time  it's  different.""  Supporters'  group  Shareholders  United,  however,  urged  the  club  to  reject  the  new  deal.  |||    A  spokesman  for  the  Shareholders  United  said:  ""I  can't  see  any  difference  (compared  to  Mr  Glazer's  previous  proposals)  other  than  £200m  less  debt.  ""He  isn't  bringing  any  money  into  the  club;  he'll  use  our  money  to  buy  it.""  |||    Mr  Glazer's  latest  move  is  being  led  by  Mr  Glazer's  two  sons,  Avi  and  Joel,  according  to  the  Financial  Times.  A  proposal  was  received  by  David  Gill,  United's  chief  executive,  at  the  end  of  last  week,  pitched  at  about  300p  a  share.  David  Cummings,  head  of  UK  equities  for  Standard  Life  Investments,  said  he  believed  a  ""well  funded""  300p  a  share  bid  would  be  enough  for  Mr  Glazer  to  take  control  of  the  club.  |||    ""I  do  not  think  there  is  anything  that  Manchester  United  fans  can  do  about  it,""  he  told  the  BBC.  ""They  can  complain  about  it  but  it  is  curtains  for  them.  They  may  not  want  him  but  they  are  going  to  get  him.""  The  US  tycoon,  who  has  been  wooing  the  club  for  the  last  12  months,  has  approached  the  United  board  with  ""detailed  proposals"",  it  has  confirmed.  |||    Mr  Glazer,  who  owns  the  Tampa  Bay  Buccaneers  team,  hopes  this  will  lead  to  a  formal  bid  being  accepted.  He  is  believed  to  have  increased  the  amount  of  equity  in  the  new  proposal,  though  it  is  not  clear  by  how  much.  For  his  proposal  to  succeed,  he  needs  the  support  of  United's  largest  shareholders,  the  Irish  horseracing  tycoons  JP  McManus  and  John  Magnier.  They  own  29%  of  United  through  their  Cubic  Expression  investment  vehicle.  Mr  Glazer  and  his  family  hold  a  stake  of  28.1%.  But  it  is  not  yet  known  whether  Mr  McManus  and  Mr  Magnier  would  support  a  Glazer  bid.  NM  Rothschild,  the  investment  bank,  is  advising  Mr  Glazer,  according  to  the  Financial  Times.  His  previous  adviser,  JPMorgan,  quit  last  year  when  Mr  Glazer  went  ahead  and  voted  against  the  appointment  of  three  United  directors  to  the  board,  against  its  advice.  But  the  FT  said  it  thought  JP  Morgan  may  still  have  had  some  role  in  financing  Mr  Glazer's  latest  financial  proposal. "

2,"Brown  'proud  of  economy  record'  |||    Gordon  Brown  has  delivered  a  rousing  speech  to  Labour's  spring  conference  setting  out  the  government's  agenda  for  the  next  general  election.  |||    The  chancellor  said  he  was  proud  of  his  party's  record  on  the  economy,  and  would  strive  for  continuing  stability  if  elected.  The  Gateshead  conference  was  told  he  would  help  young  people  who  were  struggling  to  buy  their  own  homes.  And  the  chancellor  vowed  to  continue  the  fight  against  child  poverty.  Later,  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  will  answer  questions  sent  by  the  public  via  text  and  e-mail.  |||    Analysing  Mr  Brown's  position  before  the  speech,  BBC  correspondent  James  Hardy  said  Mr  Brown  would  draw  ""sharp  dividing  lines""  with  the  Conservatives  for  the  forthcoming  election  campaign.  He  would  contrast  Labour's  plan  to  invest  £60bn  in  services  with  a  Tory  plan  to  cut  spending  by  £35bn.  ""Mr  Brown  will  lay  out  his  credentials  as  a  reforming  chancellor  determined  to  take  on  and  beat  the  Asian  tiger  economies  which  increasingly  dominate  world  trade,""  our  correspondent  said.  |||    On  Friday  night,  Mr  Brown  confirmed  he  would  not  make  any  tax  commitments  until  the  Labour  manifesto  had  been  published  after  the  Budget,  expected  in  March.  But  commentators  will  listen  to  his  speech  closely  for  hints  on  whether,  as  the  Conservatives  claim,  he  plans  to  raise  tax  after  the  election.  The  Tories  accuse  Labour  of  raising  taxes  66  times  since  coming  to  power  in  1997.  |||    Following  the  chancellor's  keynote  speech,  the  prime  minister  will  face  interactive  questioning  from  ordinary  voters  on  Saturday.  Mr  Blair  is  thought  to  be  deliberately  putting  himself  on  the  line  in  a  bid  to  engage  the  electorate  ahead  of  an  expected  May  election.  Capital  Radio  DJ  Margherita  Taylor  will  select  questions  to  put  to  him  from  thousands  e-mailed  and  sent  by  text.  The  prime  minister's  enthusiasm  for  the  job  remains  undimmed,  Alan  Milburn,  Labour's  election  strategist  told  Radio  4's  Today  programme  on  Saturday.  Mr  Blair  has  ""the  same  passion  and  the  same  commitments  for  the  job""  as  when  Labour  came  to  power  in  1997,  he  said.  |||    And  he  confirmed  Mr  Blair's  insistence  that  no  poll  date  had  yet  been  set.  He  said:  ""I'm  the  General  Election  co-ordinator  and  I  don't  know,  and  Tony  has  not  made  up  his  mind.""  On  Friday,  the  prime  minister  completed  a  whistle-stop  tour  of  England,  during  which  he  unveiled  his  party's  six  pre-election  pledges.  Starting  in  London,  he  visited  marginal  constituencies  pledging  to  build  on  what  he  said  were  Labour's  achievements  on  the  economy,  crime,  education  and  public  services.  The  Conservatives  and  Lib  Dems  said  the  pledges  -  set  to  underpin  Labour's  election  campaign  -  were  ""worthless"". "

0,"US  in  EU  tariff  chaos  trade  row  |||    The  US  has  asked  the  World  Trade  Organisation  to  investigate  European  Union  customs  tariffs,  which  it  says  are  inconsistent  and  hamper  trade.  |||    The  EU's  own  institutions  have  noted  the  uneven  way  EU  customs  rules  are  applied  but  failed  to  act,  the  US  Trade  Representative's  Office  said.  Small  and  mid-sized  US  firms  were  worst-hit,  it  added.  The  EU  expanded  from  15  to  25  member  states  in  May.  The  US  said  it  filed  the  complaint  after  talks  failed  to  find  a  solution.  |||    The  move  came  in  the  same  week  that  the  US  and  EU  stepped  back  from  confrontation  in  a  tense  dispute  over  aircraft  subsidies  to  European  manufacturer  Airbus  and  US  firm  Boeing.  New  EU  trade  commissioner  Peter  Mandelson  said  on  Tuesday  that  the  two  sides  had  agreed  to  reopen  talks  in  the  aircraft  subsidies  row,  which  led  to  tit-for-tat  WTO  filings  in  last  autumn.  |||    Explaining  why  it  has  asked  the  WTO  to  set  up  a  dispute  settlement  panel  on  customs  barriers,  the  US  Trade  Representative's  Office  said  that  it  wants  to  tackle  the  issue  ""early  in  the  EU's  process  of  dealing  with  the  problems  of  enlargement"".  Ten  countries,  mostly  in  Eastern  Europe,  joined  the  EU  in  May.  The  US  said  its  trade  with  the  25  EU  member  countries  was  worth  $155.2bn  (£82.8bn)  in  2003.  ""Although  the  EU  is  a  customs  union,  there  is  no  single  EU  customs  administration,""  a  statement  issued  on  behalf  of  Robert  Zoellick,  US  Trade  Representative,  said.  Lack  of  uniformity,  coupled  with  lack  of  procedures  for  prompt  EU-wide  review  can  hinder  US  exports,  especially  for  small  to  mid-sized  businesses"",  An  EU  spokesman  in  Washington  dismissed  the  US  complaint.  ""We  think  the  US  case  is  very  weak.  They  haven't  come  up  with  any  evidence  that  US  companies  are  being  harmed,""  said  Anthony  Gooch.  It  could  take  several  months  for  the  WTO's  dispute  settlement  panel  to  report  its  findings. "

0,"Ebbers  'aware'  of  WorldCom  fraud  |||    Former  WorldCom  boss  Bernie  Ebbers  was  directly  involved  in  the  $11bn  financial  fraud  at  the  firm,  his  closest  associate  has  told  a  US  court.  |||    Giving  evidence  in  the  criminal  trial  of  Mr  Ebbers,  ex-finance  chief  Scott  Sullivan  implicated  his  colleague  in  the  accounting  scandal  at  the  firm.  Mr  Sullivan,  WorldCom's  former  number  two,  is  the  government's  chief  witness  in  its  case  against  Mr  Ebbers.  Mr  Ebbers  has  denied  multiple  charges  of  conspiracy  and  fraud.  |||    Senior  WorldCom  executives  are  accused  of  orchestrating  a  huge  fraud  at  the  former  telecoms  company  in  which  they  exaggerated  revenues  and  hid  the  cost  of  expenses.  The  firm  was  forced  into  bankruptcy,  the  largest  in  US  history.  Mr  Sullivan,  42,  pleaded  guilty  to  fraud  last  year  and  agreed  to  assist  the  government  with  its  case  against  Mr  Ebbers.  |||    Prosecutors  have  alleged  that  Mr  Ebbers,  63,  directed  Mr  Sullivan  to  hide  the  true  state  of  the  company's  finances  by  providing  false  information  to  the  firm's  accountants.  Mr  Ebbers  has  denied  all  the  charges,  saying  he  was  unaware  of  the  fraud.  His  lawyers  claim  that  their  client  was  unfamiliar  with  detailed  accounting  practices  and  left  that  side  of  the  business  to  Mr  Sullivan.  |||    However,  on  Monday  Mr  Sullivan  named  Mr  Ebbers  as  one  of  five  executives  who  participated  in  the  accounting  fraud.  ""He  [Ebbers]  has  got  a  hands-on  grasp  of  financial  information,""  Mr  Sullivan  told  a  New  York  court.  On  his  first  day  of  questioning,  Mr  Sullivan  admitted  to  falsifying  the  company's  financial  statements.  |||    ""We  did  not  disclose  these  adjustments,""  he  said.  ""We  did  not  talk  about  these  adjustments  and  the  information  was  false.""  Mr  Sullivan  said  his  former  boss  knew  more  about  accounting  matters  than  many  chief  financial  officers  and  described  him  as  ""detail-oriented"".  |||    He  portrayed  Mr  Ebbers,  a  charismatic  businessman  who  built  up  WorldCom  from  a  small  regional  operator  into  one  of  America's  largest  telecoms  firms,  as  obsessed  with  costs.  ""He  would  talk  about  that  there  were  more  coffee  filters  than  coffee  bags  and  that  means  employees  are  taking  coffee  home,""  he  said.  ""We  needed  to  cut  expenses.  We  needed  to  cut  a  lot  more  than  coffee  expenses.""  Mr  Sullivan  is  at  the  centre  of  the  government's  case  against  Mr  Ebbers.  Mr  Ebbers  could  face  a  sentence  of  85  years  if  convicted  of  all  the  charges  he  is  facing. "

3,"Scrum-half  Williams  rejoins  Bath  |||    Bath  have  signed  their  former  scrum-half  Andy  Williams  on  a  short-term  deal  from  the  Neath-Swansea  Ospreys.  |||    Wales  international  Williams,  whose  contract  with  the  Welsh  region  was  due  to  expire  in  June,  has  agreed  a  contract  until  the  end  of  the  season.  With  Martyn  Wood's  injury  likely  to  keep  him  out  until  February,  Bath  need  experienced  back-up  to  Nick  Walshe.  Said  Williams:  ""When  this  opportunity  presented  itself,  I  did  not  really  have  to  think  twice  about  it.""  Williams,  capped  by  Wales  against  Romania  in  2003,  should  figure  in  the  match  squad  for  Monday's  Zurich  Premiership  match  at  Sale  Sharks.  He  lost  his  Ospreys  starting  place  to  New  Zealander  Jason  Spice  and  has  fallen  further  behind  in  the  pecking  order.  The  Welsh  region  has  two  outstanding  young  No  9  prospects  in  Richie  Rees  and  Rhodri  Wells.  Bath  director  of  rugby  Jack  Rowell,  though,  believes  Williams  fits  the  bill  perfectly.  ""He  has  been  playing  regular  Heineken  Cup  and  Celtic  League  rugby  and  he  has  a  great  affection  for  Bath,""  Rowell  told  Bath's  official  website.  ""We  are  delighted  to  be  able  to  welcome  him  back  to  the  club."" "

1,"Rap  feud  in  50  Cent's  G-Unit  crew  |||    US  rap  star  50  Cent  has  said  he  has  thrown  protege  The  Game  out  of  his  G-Unit  gang  in  a  feud  that  has  apparently  involved  two  shootings.  |||    In  a  radio  interview  on  Monday,  50  Cent  said  the  newcomer  was  disloyal  in  conflicts  with  other  rappers.  A  man  was  shot  in  the  thigh  outside  New  York's  Hot  97  studios  while  50  Cent  was  on  air.  More  shots  were  fired  outside  his  management  offices  two  hours  later.  50  Cent  appeared  on  The  Game's  debut  album,  which  was  number  one  in  the  US.  50  Cent,  whose  second  album  is  about  to  be  released  after  his  debut  made  him  one  of  hip-hop's  biggest  stars,  has  been  involved  in  recent  rivalries  with  fellow  artists  including  Fat  Joe,  Nas  and  Jadakiss.  |||    He  has  claimed  credit  for  the  success  of  The  Game,  who  has  become  the  hottest  new  star  on  the  rap  scene.  Both  were  drug  dealers  and  were  shot  before  turning  to  music.  |||    In  an  interview  with  Hot  97  on  Saturday,  The  Game  described  some  of  50  Cent's  rivals  as  ""my  friends""  and  said  he  would  not  turn  on  them.  ""Nas  is  one  of  my  friends,  and  Jada's  really  a  homie,""  he  said.  ""50's  beef  is  50's  beef  and  I  really  don't  know  where  all  this  stems  from.""  When  50  Cent  appeared  on  the  same  station  two  days  later,  he  said  The  Game  was  no  longer  a  member  of  G-Unit.  ""Every  record  he's  selling  is  based  on  me  being  on  his  record  with  him,""  he  said.  When  the  shooting  took  place  outside  the  studio,  the  interview  was  ended  and  the  rapper  was  escorted  out  of  the  building  by  security  personnel.  |||    An  unidentified  24-year-old  Los  Angeles  man  is  stable  with  a  gunshot  wound  to  the  upper  thigh.  Police  say  The  Game's  associates  may  have  heard  the  interview  and  gone  to  the  studio,  where  they  confronted  50  Cent's  entourage.  Officers  are  also  investigating  a  later  shooting  in  which  eight  bullets  were  fired  into  the  door  of  50  Cent's  management  company,  Violator.  No  arrests  have  been  made  in  relation  to  either  incident.  50  Cent's  second  album,  The  Massacre,  is  released  on  Thursday,  five  weeks  after  The  Game's  debut,  Documentary,  went  to  number  one.  |||    Elliott  Wilson,  editor-in-chief  of  hip-hop  magazine  XXL,  said  the  feud  would  boost  publicity  for  50  Cent's  release.  ""It  helps  him  obviously  in  terms  of  exposure.  You  can't  ask  for  better  promotion,""  he  said.  But  he  added:  ""I  think  he's  making  more  and  more  enemies.  ""You  definitely  feel  like  is  he  doing  too  much  of  a  Tupac  spiral,  like  me  against  the  world.  You  bring  more  people  wanting  to  see  you  fail.""  Tupac  Shakur  was  shot  dead  in  1996. "

2,"Boateng  to  step  down  at  election  |||    Paul  Boateng,  Chief  Secretary  to  the  Treasury,  is  to  step  down  as  a  Labour  MP  at  the  forthcoming  general  election.  |||    Mr  Boateng,  53,  is  to  become  the  UK's  high  commissioner  to  South  Africa.  He  was  the  UK's  first  black  cabinet  minister  when  appointed  to  his  post  in  2002,  promoted  from  the  Home  Office,  where  he  had  been  prisons  minister.  Mr  Boateng  served  on  the  Greater  London  Council  before  being  elected  to  Parliament  in  1987,  declaring  ""today  Brent  South,  tomorrow  Soweto"".  He  will  succeed  the  previous  High  Commissioner,  Ann  Grant,  shortly  after  the  next  election,  which  is  widely  expected  to  be  held  on  5  May.  The  appointment  is  dependent  on  Labour's  re-election.  |||    Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  said:  ""Paul  has  been  both  a  valued  colleague  and  a  trusted  friend  for  many  years.  ""He  has  made  an  immense  contribution  to  public  life  in  Britain  and  I  am  delighted  that  he  has  agreed  to  continue  that  service  to  the  people  of  Britain  by  acting  as  their  representative  in  South  Africa.""  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  said:  ""Over  the  past  eight  years  Paul's  contribution  to  the  Treasury  and  the  government  has  been  exceptional  -  and  it  has  been  my  privilege  to  have  worked  closely  with  him  closely  at  the  Treasury.  ""I  congratulate  Paul  on  his  new  appointment.  ""He  has  displayed  huge  dedication  to  the  cause  of  African  development  for  many  years  and  it  is  fitting  that,  in  this  year  of  challenge  and  opportunity  for  the  African  continent,  Paul  has  been  given  such  a  pivotal  role  in  our  fight  against  poverty  and  injustice.  ""I  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work  with  Paul  on  this  vital  agenda.""  |||    Mr  Boateng  said:  ""I  am  honoured  to  be  asked  to  take  on  this  role,  especially  as  it  comes  at  such  an  integral  time  for  our  relationship  with  South  Africa  and  the  African  continent.  ""There  shall  be  many  new  challenges  and  opportunities  ahead  and  I  look  forward  to  embracing  them  with  great  anticipation.""  Asked  if  he  was  appointed  as  the  result  of  a  ""fair  and  open""  competition,  he  replied:  ""I  have  been  appointed  as  a  result  of  a  process  that's  been  used  before  by  Labour  and  Conservative  governments  to  appoint  people  of  all  parties  who  have  relevant  experience.""  Mr  Boateng  also  laughed  off  suggestions  that  his  re-election  in  Brent  South  seat  had  been  in  danger  saying  it  was  ""one  of  the  safest  Labour  seats  in  the  country"".  Shadow  foreign  secretary  Michael  Ancram  said  that,  if  in  government,  he  would  refuse  to  approve  either  Mr  Boateng's  appointment  or  that  of  ex-Cabinet  minister  Helen  Liddell  as  high  commissioner  to  Australia.  ""Mr  Blair's  appointment  of  Paul  Boateng  is  the  latest  example  of  a  worrying  trend  of  failed  Tony's  cronies  being  appointed  to  senior  diplomatic  posts,""  he  said. "

0,"Disaster  claims  'less  than  $10bn'  |||    Insurers  have  sought  to  calm  fears  that  they  face  huge  losses  after  an  earthquake  and  giant  waves  killed  at  least  38,000  people  in  southern  Asia.  |||    Munich  Re  and  Swiss  Re,  the  world's  two  biggest  reinsurers,  have  said  exposure  will  be  less  than  for  other  disasters.  Rebuilding  costs  are  likely  to  be  cheaper  than  in  developed  countries,  and  many  of  those  affected  will  not  have  insurance,  analysts  said.  Swiss  Re  has  said  total  claims  are  likely  to  be  less  than  $10bn  (£5.17bn).  Swiss  Re  believes  that  the  cost  would  be  substantial  but  that  it  is  unlikely  to  be  in  double-digit  billions,  the  Financial  Times  reported.  Munich  Re,  the  world's  largest  reinsurance  company,  said  that  its  exposure  is  less  than  100m  euros  (£70m;  $136m).  |||    At  least  10  countries  have  been  affected,  with  Sri  Lanka,  Indonesia,  India  and  Thailand  among  the  worst  hit.  The  region's  resorts  and  Western  tourists  are  expected  to  be  among  the  main  claimants.  |||    Lloyds  of  London  told  the  Financial  Times  it  expected  its  exposure  to  be  limited  to  ""holiday  resorts,  personal  accident,  travel  insurance  and  marine  risks"".  A  spokeswoman  for  Hanover  Re,  Europe's  fifth-largest  reinsurance  firm,  estimated  tsunami-related  damage  claims  would  be  in  the  low  double-digit  millions  of  euros.  The  company  has  paid  out  about  300  million  euros  (£281m;  $400m)  to  cover  damage  caused  recently  by  four  major  hurricanes  in  the  US.  |||    But  insurers  have  not  had  long  to  assess  the  economic  impact  of  the  damage  and  reports  of  more  casualties  and  destruction  are  still  coming  through.  |||    ""So  many  things  are  unclear,  it  is  just  too  early  to  tell,""  said  Serge  Troeber,  deputy  head  of  Swiss  Re's  natural  disasters  department.  ""You  need  very  complicated  processes  to  estimate  damages.  Unlike  the  hurricanes,  you  can't  just  run  a  model.""  He  anticipated  that  his  own  company's  total  claims  would  be  less  then  those  from  the  hurricanes,  which  the  company  put  at  $640m.  Allianz,  a  leading  German  insurer,  said  it  did  not  know  yet  what  its  exposure  would  be.  However,  it  said  the  tidal  waves  were  unlikely  to  have  a  ""significant""  impact  on  its  business.  Zurich  Financial  said  they  could  not  yet  assess  the  cost  of  the  disaster.  |||    The  impact  on  US  insurance  companies  is  not  expected  to  be  heavy,  analysts  said.  |||    Most  US  insurers  have  relatively  little  exposure  to  Asia  and  those  that  do,  pass  on  a  lot  of  the  risk  to  reinsurance  companies  or  special  catastrophe  funds.  Insured  damage  could  be  a  fraction  of  the  ""billions  of  dollars  worth  of  destruction  in  Sri  Lanka,  India,  Thailand,  Indonesia,  the  Maldive  Islands  and  Malaysia,""  said  Prudential  Equity  Group  insurance  analyst  Jay  Gelb.  ""US  insurers  are  likely  to  have  only  minimal  to  no  exposure.  It's  more  likely  the  Bermuda-based  reinsurance  [companies]  might  have  some  exposure,""  said  Paul  Newsome,  an  insurance  analyst  at  AG  Edwards  &  Co.  |||    Many  of  the  affected  countries,  such  as  Indonesia,  Sri  Lanka  or  the  Maldives,  do  not  usually  buy  insurance  for  these  kinds  of  disasters,  said  a  US-based  insurance  expert.  Early  estimates  from  the  World  Bank  put  the  amount  of  aid  needed  for  the  worst  affected  countries  including  Sri  Lanka,  India,  Indonesia  and  Thailand,  at  about  $5bn  (£2.6bn),  similar  to  the  cash  offered  to  Central  America  after  Hurricane  Mitch.  |||    Mitch  killed  about  10,000  people  and  caused  damage  of  about  $10bn  in  1998.  But  the  cost  of  the  tsunamis  on  the  individuals  involved  is  incalculable.  ""We  cannot  fathom  the  cost  of  these  poor  societies  and  the  nameless  fishermen  and  fishing  villages  ...  that  have  just  been  wiped  out.  Hundreds  of  thousands  of  livelihoods  have  gone,""  said  Jan  Egeland,  head  of  the  UN  Office  for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs.  Tourists  cutting  short  their  holidays  in  affected  areas  may  suffer  a  financial  impact  too.  The  Association  of  British  insurers  warned  that  travel  insurance  does  not  normally  cover  cutting  short  a  holiday.  It  said  loss  of  possessions  will  usually  be  covered,  but  the  Association  stressed  the  importance  of  checking  the  wording  of  travel  policies. "

1,"Bollywood  DVD  fraudster  is  jailed  |||    A  major  distributor  of  pirated  DVDs  of  Bollywood  films  has  been  sent  to  prison  for  three  years.  |||    Jayanti  Amarishi  Buhecha  from  Cambridge  was  found  guilty  of  two  trademark  offences  last  month,  and  sentenced  at  Harrow  Crown  Court,  London,  on  Tuesday.  Buhecha,  who  made  £26,000  per  month  from  his  illegal  trade,  was  called  ""one  of  the  biggest  Bollywood  pirates  in  the  UK""  by  the  sentencing  judge.  The  British  Phonographic  Industry  (BPI)  worked  for  two  years  on  the  case.  |||    An  operation  was  launched  against  Buhecha  in  2002  after  complaints  were  received  about  his  activities.  The  judge  in  the  case,  which  lasted  seven  days,  said  that  ""a  heavy  penalty  was  called  for  because  of  the  enormous  damage  Buhecha  caused  to  legitimate  business"".  Fake  DVDs  were  manufactured  in  Pakistan  and  Malaysia  and  sold  on  wholesale  to  shops  by  Buhecha,  who  traded  in  conterfeit  DVDs  in  2002  and  2003.  |||    In  December  2002,  he  was  stopped  in  his  car  by  trading  standards  officers,  who  uncovered  1,000  pirated  DVDs  and  faked  inlay  cards  printed  with  registered  trademarks.  Despite  being  arrested  and  bailed,  Buhecha  was  caught  a  second  time  at  the  end  of  2003.  His  home  and  a  lock-up  in  Cambridge  were  found  to  contain  18,000  counterfeit  DVDs  and  further  faked  inlay  cards.  Buhecha  was  previously  a  legitimate  distributor  of  Bollywood  films,  but  was  suspended  and  sued  by  his  employers  for  dealing  in  illegal  copies  of  Bollywood  classic  Mohabbatein.  Legitimate  Bollywood  film  distributors  have  hailed  the  conviction  as  ""a  major  boost"".  Bollywood  music  and  film  suffers  piracy  at  the  rate  of  40%,  which  is  more  than  that  suffered  by  mainstream  productions.  The  BPI  welcomed  the  news  of  the  prison  sentence,  but  warned  there  are  plenty  of  other  active  counterfeiters  of  Bollywood  films.  The  organisation's  anti-piracy  director  David  Martin  said:  ""The  problem  simply  will  not  disappear  with  Buhecha.  Others  and  more  will  take  his  place,  so  it's  vital  that  keep  up  our  efforts  in  this  field."" "

0,"Wall  Street  cool  to  eBay's  profit  |||    Shares  in  online  auction  house  eBay  fell  9.8%  in  after-hours  trade  on  Wednesday,  after  its  quarterly  profits  failed  to  meet  market  expectations.  |||    Despite  seeing  net  profits  rise  by  44%  to  $205.4m  (£110m)  during  October  to  December,  from  $142m  a  year  earlier,  Wall  Street  had  expected  more.  EBay  stock  fell  to  $92.9  in  after-hours  trade,  from  a  $103.05  end  on  Nasdaq.  EBay's  net  revenue  for  the  quarter  rose  to  $935.8m  from  $648.4m,  boosted  by  growth  at  its  PayPal  payment  service.  |||    Excluding  special  items,  eBay's  profit  was  33  cents  a  share,  but  analysts  had  expected  34  cents.  |||    ""I  think  Wall  Street  has  gotten  a  bit  ahead  of  eBay  this  quarter  and  for  the  2005  year.""  said  Janco  Partners  analyst  Martin  Pyykkonen.  For  2004  as  a  whole,  eBay  earned  $778.2m  on  sales  of  $3.27bn.  EBay  president  and  chief  executive  Meg  Whitman  called  2004  an  ""outstanding  success""  that  generated  ""tremendous  momentum""  for  2005.  ""I'm  more  confident  than  ever  that  the  decisions  and  investments  we're  making  today  will  ensure  a  bright  future  for  the  company  and  our  community  of  users  around  the  world,""  she  said.  EBay  now  forecasts  2005  revenue  of  $4.2bn  to  $4.35bn  and  earnings  excluding  items  of  $1.48  to  $1.52  per  share.  Analysts  had  previously  estimated  that  eBay  would  achieve  2005  revenues  of  $4.37bn  and  earnings  of  $1.62  per  share,  excluding  items. "

The  deal  gives  Inbev,  the  world's  biggest  beermaker,  near-total  control  over  the  Russian  brewer.  Inbev  bought  out  another  partner  in  August  2004.  Inbev  brands  include  Bass,  Stella  Artois,  Hoegaarden  and  Staropramen.  It  employs  77,000  people,  running  operations  in  over  30  countries  across  the  Americas,  Europe  and  Asia  Pacific.  |||    The  Leuven-based  brewery  said  it  would  own  97.3%  of  the  voting  shares  and  98.8%  of  the  non-voting  shares  of  Sun  Interbrew.  The  deal  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  the  first  quarter  of  2005.  Inbev  was  formed  in  August  2004  when  Belgium's  Interbrew  bought  Brazilian  brewer  Ambev.  Sun  Interbrew,  which  employs  8,000  staff,  owns  breweries  in  eight  Russian  cities  -  Klin,  Ivanovo,  Saransk,  Kursk,  Volzhsky,  Omsk,  Perm  and  Novocheboksarsk.

1,"Rock  group  Korn's  guitarist  quits  |||    The  guitarist  with  US  rock  band  Korn  has  quit  the  music  business,  saying  he  made  the  decision  after  experiencing  a  religious  awakening.  |||    Brian  'Head'  Welch  told  a  radio  station  in  California  that  his  bandmates  respected  his  decision  to  leave.  A  replacement  guitarist  has  yet  to  be  named  by  Korn,  who  are  currently  at  work  on  their  eighth  studio  album.  Welch  added  that  he  would  appear  at  a  church  in  Bakersfield  to  explain  how  he  ""got  to  this  place  in  life"".  The  remaining  members  of  Korn,  who  are  known  for  their  hardcore  brand  of  rock,  said  they  hoped  Welch  ""finds  the  happiness  he  is  looking  for"".  |||    The  34-year-old  made  reference  to  the  band's  aggressive  brand  of  music  and  its  young  fans  in  his  parting  statement.  ""Anger  is  a  good  thing,  and  if  kids  want  to  listen  to  Korn,  good,  but  there's  happiness  after  the  anger,""  he  told  his  local  radio  station  in  Bakersfield.  ""I'm  going  to  show  it  through  my  actions,  how  much  I  love  my  fans,""  added  Welch.  Korn  have  enjoyed  a  moderate  degree  of  chart  success  in  the  UK,  with  10  singles  breaking  into  the  Top  40.  Their  best  performance  to  date  in  the  UK  has  been  2002's  Here  To  Stay,  which  reached  number  12,  while  their  album  Untouchables,  released  in  the  same  year,  made  it  to  number  four.

0,"Watchdog  probes  Vivendi  bond  sale  |||    French  stock  market  regulator  AMF  has  filed  complaints  against  media  giant  Vivendi  Universal,  its  boss  and  another  top  executive.  |||    It  believes  the  prospectus  for  a  bond  issue  was  unclear  and  that  executives  may  have  had  privileged  information.  AMF  has  begun  proceedings  against  Vivendi,  its  chief  executive  Jean-Rene  Fourtou  and  chief  operating  officer  Jean-Bernard  Levy.  Vivendi  advisor  Deutsche  Bank  was  also  the  subject  of  a  complaint  filing.  Deutsche  Bank,  which  was  responsible  for  selling  the  convertible  bonds  to  investors,  could  face  penalties  if  the  complaint  is  upheld.  |||    Vivendi  has  said  it  believes  there  is  ""no  legal  basis""  for  the  complaints.  The  watchdog  is  said  to  believe  the  executive  pair  were  party  to  ""privileged  information""  surrounding  the  issue  of  the  bonds.  Both  men  bought  some  of  the  bonds,  the  Associated  Press  news  agency  reported.  AMF  is  investigating  claims  that  the  duo  were  aware  of  an  interest  in  Vivendi's  US  assets  from  investor  Marvin  Davis,  at  the  time  of  the  bond  sale.  Vivendi,  however,  has  said  that  the  information  was  public  knowledge  as  Mr  Davis'  offer  for  the  US  assets  had  already  been  rejected  by  Vivendi's  board.  AMF  is  also  looking  into  whether  the  executives  knew  that  Vivendi  was  considering  exercising  its  right  to  buy  British  Telecom's  shares  in  Cegetel.  Vivendi  has  rejected  the  charge,  saying  the  decision  to  buy  the  Cegetel  shares  was  ""no  more  than  a  possibility,  of  which  the  public  was  perfectly  aware""  at  the  time  of  the  bond  issue.  Back  in  December,  Vivendi  and  its  former  chief  executive  Jean-Marie  Messier  were  each  fined  1m  euros  ($1.3m;  £690,000)  by  AMF.  The  fines  came  after  a  15-month  probe  into  allegations  that  the  media  giant  misled  investors  after  a  costly  acquisition  programme  went  wrong. "

1,"Uganda  bans  Vagina  Monologues  |||    Uganda's  authorities  have  banned  the  play  The  Vagina  Monologues,  due  to  open  in  the  capital,  Kampala  this  weekend.  |||    The  Ugandan  Media  Council  said  the  performance  would  not  be  put  on  as  it  promoted  and  glorified  acts  such  as  lesbianism  and  homosexuality.  It  said  the  production  could  go  ahead  if  the  organisers  ""expunge  all  the  offending  parts"".  But  the  organisers  of  the  play  say  it  raises  awareness  of  sexual  abuse  against  women.  ""The  play  promotes  illegal,  unnatural  sexual  acts,  homosexuality  and  prostitution,  it  should  be  and  is  hereby  banned,""  the  council's  ruling  said.  |||    The  show,  which  has  been  a  controversial  sell-out  around  the  world,  explores  female  sexuality  and  strength  through  individual  women  telling  their  stories  through  monologues.  Some  parliamentarians  and  church  leaders  are  also  siding  with  the  Media  Council,  Uganda's  New  Vision  newspaper  reports.  ""The  play  is  obscene  and  pornographic  although  it  was  under  the  guise  of  women's  liberation,""  MP  Kefa  Ssempgani  told  parliament.  |||    But  the  work's  author,  US  playwright  Eve  Ensler,  says  it  is  all  about  women's  empowerment.  ""There  is  obviously  some  fear  of  the  vagina  and  saying  the  word  vagina,""  Ms  Ensler  told  the  BBC.  ""It's  not  a  slang  word  or  dirty  word  it's  a  biological,  anatomical  word.""  She  said  the  play  is  being  produced  and  performed  by  Ugandan  women  and  it  is  not  being  forced  on  them.  The  four  Ugandan  NGOs  organising  the  play  intended  to  raise  money  to  campaign  to  stop  violence  against  women  and  to  raise  funds  for  the  war-torn  north  of  the  country.  ""I'm  extremely  outraged  at  the  hypocrisy,""  the  play's  organiser  in  Uganda,  Sarah  Mukasa,  told  the  BBC's  Focus  on  Africa  programme.  ""I'm  amazed  that  this  country  Uganda  gives  the  impression  that  it  is  progressive  and  supports  women's  rights  and  the  notions  of  free  speech;  yet  when  women  want  to  share  their  stories  the  government  uses  the  apparatus  of  state  to  shut  us  up.""

2,"Straw  backs  ending  China  embargo  |||    UK  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  has  defended  plans  to  end  the  European  Union's  arms  embargo  on  China,  despite  opposition  from  the  US  and  Japan.  |||    Mr  Straw,  visiting  Beijing,  noted  arms  embargoes  applied  to  China,  Burma  and  Zimbabwe  but  not  to  North  Korea,  which  he  said  had  a  terrible  rights  record.  The  EU  imposed  its  arms  ban  on  China  in  1989  after  troops  opened  fire  on  protestors  in  Tiananmen  Square.  Mr  Straw  also  signed  a  deal  on  China-UK  tourism.  It  is  expected  this  would  increase  the  number  of  Chinese  tourists  by  40,000  per  year,  providing  $120m  in  revenue.  China  has  in  the  past  said  it  sees  the  weapons  ban  as  politically  driven,  and  does  not  want  it  lifted  in  order  to  buy  more  weapons.  Mr  Straw,  speaking  at  a  joint  news  conference  with  Chinese  Foreign  Minister  Li  Zhaoxing,  stressed  this  point.  ""The  result  of  any  decision  [to  lift  the  arms  embargo]  should  not  be  an  increase  in  arms  exports  from  European  Union  member  states  to  China,  either  in  quantitative  or  qualitative  terms,""  Mr  Straw  said.  Earlier  this  week  he  said  he  expected  the  embargo  to  be  lifted  within  six  months.  |||    But  Mr  Straw  faces  tough  opposition  to  the  move.  Tory  foreign  affairs  spokesman  Michael  Ancram  said  lifting  the  arms  embargo  would  be  ""irresponsible""  and  would  damage  Britain's  relations  with  the  US.  He  said  Mr  Straw  was  ""naive  beyond  belief""  if  he  accepted  China's  claim  it  does  not  want  the  ban  lifted  in  order  to  buy  weapons.  The  French  want  the  embargo  lifted  because  they  want  to  sell  arms  to  China;  the  Chinese  want  it  lifted  because  they  want  to  buy  arms  and  battlefield  technology  from  Europe.""  When  he  was  in  Tokyo  earlier  this  week,  Japanese  Foreign  Minister  Nobutaka  Machimura  told  the  British  minister  that  his  plan  to  remove  the  embargo  was  ""  a  worrying  issue  that  concerns  the  security  and  environment  of  not  only  Japan,  but  also  East  Asia  overall"".  Washington  argues  that  if  the  embargo  is  lifted,  it  could  lead  to  a  buying  spree  for  arms  that  China  could  use  to  threaten  its  diplomatic  rival  Taiwan.  Beijing  says  Taiwan  is  part  of  Chinese  territory  and  wants  to  unite  it  with  the  mainland,  by  force  if  necessary.  The  US  is  bound  by  law  to  help  Taiwan  defend  itself.  Washington  has  also  voiced  concern  that  the  human  rights  conditions  in  China  have  not  improved  enough  to  merit  an  end  to  the  embargo.  It  is  an  issue  raised  by  human  rights  groups  too.  Brad  Adams,  from  the  UK's  Human  Rights  Watch,  said:  ""This  is  a  huge  political  signal  from  Europe  that  they  are  willing  to  forget  about  Tiananmen  Square.""  But  Mr  Straw  insisted  the  EU's  code  of  conduct  on  arms  exports  meant  tough  criteria  on  human  rights  still  had  to  be  met  if  the  embargo  was  lifted. "

2,"Tsunami  debt  deal  to  be  announced  |||    Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  has  said  he  hopes  to  announce  a  deal  to  suspend  debt  interest  repayments  by  tsunami-hit  nations  later  on  Friday.  |||    The  agreement  by  the  G8  group  of  wealthy  nations  would  save  affected  countries  £3bn  pounds  a  year,  he  said.  The  deal  is  thought  to  have  been  hammered  out  on  Thursday  night  after  Japan,  one  of  the  biggest  creditor  nations,  finally  signed  up  to  it.  Mr  Brown  first  proposed  the  idea  earlier  this  week.  |||    G8  ministers  are  also  believed  to  have  agreed  to  instruct  the  World  Bank  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  to  complete  a  country  by  country  analysis  of  the  reconstruction  problems  faced  by  all  states  hit  by  the  disaster.  Mr  Brown  has  been  locked  in  talks  with  finance  ministers  of  the  G8,  which  Britain  now  chairs.  Germany  also  proposed  a  freeze  and  Canada  has  begun  its  own  moratorium.  The  expected  deal  comes  as  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  said  the  number  of  Britons  dead  or  missing  in  the  disaster  have  reached  440. "

1,"Howl  helps  boost  Japan's  cinemas  |||    Japan's  box  office  received  a  3.8%  boost  last  year,  with  ticket  sales  worth  211bn  yen  (£1.08bn).  |||    The  surge  was  led  by  animated  movie  Howl's  Moving  Castle,  which  took  20bn  yen  (£102m)  to  become  the  biggest  film  in  Japan  in  2004.  It  is  expected  to  match  the  30.7bn  yen  (£157m)  record  of  Hayao  Miyazaki's  previous  film  Spirited  Away.  Japan  Motion  Picture  Producers  figures  showed  that  170  million  cinema  admissions  were  made  in  Japan  in  2004.  The  Last  Samurai,  starring  Tom  Cruise,  was  the  biggest  foreign  movie  hit  in  Japan  last  year,  taking  13.8bn  yen  (£70.7m).  |||    It  was  followed  by  Harry  Potter  and  the  Prisoner  of  Azkaban,  Finding  Nemo  and  The  Lord  of  the  Rings:  The  Return  of  the  King.  The  second  highest-grossing  Japanese  film  was  romantic  drama  Crying  Out  Love  in  the  Centre  of  the  World,  followed  by  Be  With  You  and  Pocket  Monsters  Advanced  Generation.  Japanese  films  accounted  for  37.5%  of  Japan's  box  office  total  last  year,  with  foreign  films  taking  the  remaining  62.5%.  This  represented  a  4.5%  gain  for  the  proportion  of  Japanese  films  in  2004  compared  to  2003.  The  number  of  Japanese  films  released  rose  to  310  in  2004  from  287  the  previous  year.  Sales  of  movies  on  DVD  and  video  amounted  to  497bn  yen  (£2.54bn)  for  the  year. "

2,"Kennedy  criticises  'unfair'  taxes  |||    Gordon  Brown  has  failed  to  tackle  the  ""fundamental  unfairness""  in  the  tax  system  in  his  ninth  Budget,  Charles  Kennedy  has  said.  |||    How  was  it  right  that  the  poorest  20%  of  society  were  still  paying  more  as  a  proportion  of  their  income  than  the  richest  20%,  the  Lib  Dem  leader  asked.  The  new  £200  council  tax  rebate  for  pensioners  did  nothing  to  fix  the  ""unfair  tax"",  he  added.  The  government  could  not  go  on  ""patching  up""  the  system,  he  added.  Speaking  in  the  Commons  after  Mr  Brown  had  delivered  what  is  widely  thought  to  be  the  last  Budget  before  the  general  election,  Mr  Kennedy  acknowledged  that  the  UK  was  one  of  the  most  successful  economies  in  the  world.  |||    But  he  criticised  both  the  chancellor  and  the  Tories  for  failing  to  address  the  ""ticking  bomb""  of  council  tax  revaluation.  He  said  the  recent  experience  of  Wales  indicated  seven  million  households  in  England  would  pay  significantly  more  after  revaluation.  The  chancellor's  announcement  that  he  was  to  offer  a  £200  council  tax  rebate  paid  by  pensioner  households  was  merely  a  ""sticking  plaster""  to  a  much  bigger  problem.  The  Lib  Dem  plan  for  a  local  income  tax  would  benefit  the  typical  household  by  more  than  £450  a  year,  with  half  of  all  pensioners  paying  no  local  tax  and  about  three  million  being  better  off.  |||    On  pensions,  Mr  Kennedy  said  it  was  a  ""scandal""  that  the  system  discriminated  against  women  who  had  missed  making  National  Insurance  payments  when  they  were  having  children.  He  said  a  residency  criteria  would  end  ""at  a  stroke  this  fundamental  iniquity"".  Mr  Kennedy  added  his  party's  priorities  of  free  long-term  care  for  the  elderly,  abolishing  top-up  fees  and  replacing  the  council  tax  would  be  funded  by  charging  50%  income  tax  to  those  earning  more  than  £100,000  per  annum.  He  contrasted  his  approach  with  Mr  Brown's  pledge  in  2001  not  to  increase  income  tax.  The  chancellor  went  on  to  put  up  National  Insurance  contributions  after  the  election.  ""For  most  individuals,  most  families,  most  households,  it  adds  up  to  exactly  the  same  thing,""  said  Mr  Kennedy.  ""And  they  wonder  why  people  get  cynical  about  their  politicians  when  they  give  one  impression  before  an  election  and  do  exactly  the  opposite  after  that  election."" "

0,"GM  pays  $2bn  to  evade  Fiat  buyout  |||    General  Motors  of  the  US  is  to  pay  Fiat  1.55bn  euros  ($2bn;  £1.1bn)  to  get  out  of  a  deal  which  could  have  forced  it  to  buy  the  Italian  car  maker  outright.  |||    Fiat  had  sold  GM  a  stake  in  2000,  as  part  of  a  partnership  agreement.  But  Fiat's  heavy  losses  have  convinced  GM  -  whose  own  European  operations  are  in  the  red  -  to  back  away.  The  pay-off  means  the  two  firms  will  unwind  joint  ventures,  but  Fiat  will  keep  supplying  diesel  engines  and  the  money  will  allow  it  to  reduce  its  debt.  Fiat's  shares  on  the  Milan  stock  exchange  rose  4.5%  by  0900  GMT  to  6.2  euros,  having  shot  up  more  than  7%  in  early  trading.  ""We  now  have  absolute  freedom  to  design  our  own  future,""  said  Fiat  chief  executive  Sergio  Marchionne.  |||    Analysts  said  Fiat  seemed  to  have  done  well  out  of  the  deal,  although  some  predictions  had  expected  a  2bn  euro  pay-off.  Fiat  is  to  get  1bn  euros  immediately,  with  another  550m  to  follow  within  90  days.  The  firm  is  Italy's  largest  private  employer,  and  a  failure  to  reach  an  agreement  could  have  had  severe  consequences  for  thousands  of  workers  and  for  the  Italian  economy.  For  its  part,  GM  was  keen  to  ward  off  any  criticism  that  the  deal  had  been  a  mistake.  |||    ""We  needed  scale  in  Europe  to  get  costs  down,  and  we  were  able  to  do  that  in  working  with  Fiat,""  said  GM  chief  executive  Rick  Wagoner.  |||    The  Fiat-GM  alliance  came  about  in  2000  as  an  alternative  to  selling  Fiat  outright.  German-US  car  firm  DaimlerChrysler  had  been  willing  to  buy  the  firm,  but  Fiat  patriarch  Gianni  Agnelli  did  not  want  to  give  up  control.  Instead,  GM  swapped  a  6%  stake  in  itself  for  20%  of  Fiat  -  and  gave  Fiat  a  ""put  option""  to  sell  GM  the  rest  of  the  car  maker  between  January  2004  and  July  2009.  But  despite  the  alliance  Fiat  failed  to  put  itself  back  on  track,  continuing  to  lose  money  and  market  share.  As  a  result,  the  sell-off  looked  better  and  better  for  the  Italians  -  and  much  worse  for  GM,  which  is  struggling  with  its  own  loss-making  European  marques  Opel  and  Saab.  The  relationship  soured  further  after  Fiat  sold  half  its  finance  arm  and  recapitalised  in  2003,  halving  GM's  stake  to  10%. "

1,"Animation  charms  Japan  box  office  |||    Oscar-winning  director  Hayao  Miyazaki's  latest  film  has  set  a  new  Japanese  box  office  record,  with  1.5bn  yen  ($14.3m)  in  two  days,  according  to  reports.  |||    Howl's  Moving  Castle  is  the  follow-up  to  Miyazaki's  Spirited  Away,  which  won  best  animation  at  last  year's  Oscars.  It  is  based  on  the  children's  book  by  English  writer  Diana  Wynne  Jones.  It  has  registered  the  highest  opening  weekend  takings  of  any  Japanese  film  in  the  country,  according  to  trade  publication  Screen  Daily.  |||    The  film  is  about  an  18-year-old  girl  who  is  trapped  in  an  old  woman's  body  after  being  put  under  a  spell  by  a  witch.  Its  two-day  takings  represented  1.1  million  cinema  admissions,  Screen  Daily  said.  The  film's  distributor  Toho  expects  40  million  people  to  see  it  in  total  -  almost  one  third  of  the  country's  population  -  it  added.  The  film  won  the  Golden  Osella  for  outstanding  technical  contribution  at  this  year's  Venice  Film  Festival. "

3,"Owen  determined  to  stay  in  Madrid  |||    England  forward  Michael  Owen  has  told  the  BBC  he  is  happy  in  Spain  and  has  no  plans  to  quit  Real  Madrid  to  return  to  the  Premiership  in  the  near  future.  |||    But  the  25-year-old,  who  has  spent  much  of  his  time  coming  off  the  bench  in  La  Liga,  did  not  rule  out  a  return  to  the  Premiership  at  some  stage.  ""I'm  pleased  with  the  start  I've  made  here,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  Five  Live.  ""England  is  my  country.  It's  definitely  part  of  me  but  who  knows  whether,  if  or  when  I'll  be  playing  there  again.""  Owen,  who  moved  to  the  Bernabeu  from  Liverpool  last  summer,  has  grabbed  11  goals  for  Real  but  has  been  unable  to  replace  Raul  or  Ronaldo  in  the  starting  line-up.  However,  he  said  he  was  delighted  with  the  way  his  time  in  Spain  was  going  and  dismissed  criticism  of  his  decision  to  join  Real.  ""When  I  first  came  there  was  a  lot  of  scepticism  back  in  England,  any  maybe  some  out  here,""  he  said.  ""People  were  saying  'fourth-choice  striker,  what  are  you  going  there  for?  You'll  be  sat  on  the  bench  all  the  time'.  |||    ""But  as  much  as  our  press  like  to  build  it  up  as  if  I've  permanently  had  my  backside  on  the  bench,  I've  played  as  many  games  as  anyone  else  in  the  team  this  year.  ""For  a  fourth-choice  striker  at  the  start  I'm  more  than  happy  with  the  way  I've  settled  in.""  Recent  speculation  has  linked  Owen  with  a  move  back  to  England,  with  Newcastle  expressing  their  interest,  but  the  England  striker  said  he  is  not  ready  to  return  home.  He  added:  ""I've  got  nothing  against  the  Premiership,  I  mean  that's  where  I  first  performed,  that's  where  I  made  my  name.  |||    ""I  can't  keep  my  eyes  off  the  Premiership  on  television  when  I'm  at  home.""  When  asked  if  it  would  have  to  be  Liverpool  if  he  returned  Owen  said:  ""I've  not  really  given  it  much  thought.  ""I've  got  great  memories  of  Liverpool.  No  matter  what  happens  it'll  always  be  a  club  I  have  fond  memories  of  and  it  will  always  have  a  place  in  my  heart.  ""It's  very  flattering  to  be  linked  to  top  clubs  in  England  -  I'm  glad  that  no-one  is  forgetting  me!  ""But  I  couldn't  have  wished  for  a  better  start  in  Madrid.""  |||    -  Listen  to  the  full  interview  with  Garry  Richardson  on  BBC  Radio  Five  Live's  Sportsweek  at  0900  GMT  on  Sunday.

0,"US  trade  gap  ballooned  in  October  |||    The  US  trade  deficit  widened  by  more  than  expected  in  October,  hitting  record  levels  after  higher  oil  prices  raised  import  costs,  figures  have  shown  |||    The  trade  shortfall  was  $55.5bn  (£29bn),  up  9%  from  September,  the  Commerce  Department  said.  That  pushed  the  10  month  deficit  to  $500.5bn.  Imports  rose  by  3.4%,  while  exports  increased  by  only  0.6%.  A  weaker  dollar  also  increased  the  cost  of  imports,  though  this  should  help  drive  export  demand  in  coming  months.  ""Things  are  getting  worse,  but  that's  to  be  expected,""  said  David  Wyss  of  Standard  &  Poor's  in  New  York.  ""The  first  thing  is  that  when  the  dollar  goes  down,  it  increases  the  price  of  imports.  ""We  are  seeing  improved  export  orders.  Things  seem  to  be  going  in  the  right  direction.""  |||    Despite  this  optimism,  significant  concerns  remain  as  to  how  the  US  will  fund  its  trade  and  budget  deficits  should  they  continue  to  widen.  Another  problem  highlighted  by  analysts  was  the  growing  trade  gap  with  China,  which  has  been  accused  of  keeping  its  currency  artificially  weak  in  order  to  boost  exports.  The  US  imported  almost  $20bn  worth  of  goods  from  China  during  October,  exporting  a  little  under  $3bn.  ""It  seems  the  key  worry  that  has  existed  in  the  currency  market  still  remains,""  said  Anthony  Crescenzi,  a  bond  strategist  at  Miller  Tabak  in  New  York.  The  trade  deficit  and  the  shortfall  with  China  ""are  big  issues  going  forward"".  The  Commerce  Department  figures  caused  the  dollar  to  weaken  further  despite  widespread  expectations  that  the  Federal  Reserve  will  raise  interest  rates  for  a  fifth  time  this  year.  Borrowing  costs  are  tipped  to  rise  by  a  quarter  of  a  percentage  point  to  2.25%  at  a  Fed  meeting  later  on  Tuesday. "

0,"China  continues  breakneck  growth  |||    China's  economy  has  expanded  by  a  breakneck  9.5%  during  2004,  faster  than  predicted  and  well  above  2003's  9.1%.  |||    The  news  may  mean  more  limits  on  investment  and  lending  as  Beijing  tries  to  take  the  economy  off  the  boil.  China  has  sucked  in  raw  materials  and  energy  to  feed  its  expansion,  which  could  have  knock-on  effects  on  the  rest  of  the  world  if  it  overheats.  But  officials  pointed  out  that  industrial  growth  had  slowed,  with  services  providing  much  of  the  impetus.  Growth  in  industrial  output  -  the  main  target  of  government  efforts  to  impose  curbs  on  credit  and  investments  -  was  11.5%  in  2004,  down  from  17%  the  previous  year.  |||    Still,  consumer  prices  -  at  2.4%  -  rose  faster  than  in  2004,  adding  to  concern  that  a  sharp  rise  in  producer  prices  of  7.1%  could  stoke  inflation.  And  overall  investment  in  fixed  assets  was  still  high,  up  21.3%  from  the  previous  year  -  although  some  way  off  the  peak  of  43%  seen  in  the  first  quarter  of  2004.  The  result  could  be  higher  interest  rates.  China  raised  rates  by  0.27  percentage  points  to  5.8%  -  its  first  hike  in  nine  years  -  in  October  2004.  |||    Despite  the  apparent  rebalancing  of  the  economy  the  overall  growth  picture  remains  strong,  economists  said.  ""There  is  no  sign  of  a  slowdown  in  2005,""  said  Tim  Congdon,  economist  at  ING  Barings.  |||    China's  economy  is  not  only  gathering  speed  thanks  to  domestic  demand,  but  also  from  soaring  sales  overseas.  Figures  released  earlier  this  year  showed  exports  at  a  six-year  high  in  2004,  up  35%.  Part  of  the  impetus  comes  from  the  relative  cheapness  of  the  yuan,  China's  currency.  The  government  keeps  it  pegged  close  to  a  rate  of  8.28  to  the  US  dollar,  -  much  to  the  chagrin  of  many  US  lawmakers  who  blame  China  for  lost  jobs  and  competitiveness.  Despite  urging  to  ease  the  peg,  officials  insist  they  are  a  long  way  from  ready  to  make  a  shift  to  a  more  market-set  rate.  ""We  need  a  good  and  feasible  plan  and  formulating  such  a  plan  also  needs  time,""  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  chief  Li  Deshui  told  Reuters.  ""Those  who  hope  to  make  a  fortune  by  speculating  on  a  renminbi  revaluation  will  not  succeed  in  making  a  profit."" "

1,"Housewives  lift  Channel  4  ratings  |||    The  debut  of  US  television  hit  Desperate  Housewives  has  helped  lift  Channel  4's  January  audience  share  by  12%  compared  to  last  year.  |||    Other  successes  such  as  Celebrity  Big  Brother  and  The  Simpsons  have  enabled  the  broadcaster  to  surpass  BBC2  for  the  first  month  since  last  July.  However  the  channel's  share  of  the  audience  fell  from  11.2%  to  9.6%  last  month  in  comparison  with  January  2004.  Celebrity  Big  Brother  attracted  less  viewers  than  its  2002  series.  |||    Comedy  drama  Desperate  Housewives  managed  to  pull  in  five  million  viewers  at  one  point  during  its  run  to  date,  attracting  a  quarter  of  the  television  audience.  The  two  main  television  channels,  BBC1  and  ITV1,  have  both  seen  their  monthly  audience  share  decline  in  a  year  on  year  comparison  for  January,  while  Five's  proportion  remained  the  same  at  a  slender  6.3%.  Digital  multi-channel  TV  is  continuing  to  be  the  strongest  area  of  growth,  with  the  BBC  reporting  Freeview  box  ownership  of  five  million,  including  one  million  sales  in  the  last  portion  of  2004.  Its  share  of  the  audience  soared  by  20%  in  January  2005  compared  with  last  year,  and  currently  stands  at  an  average  of  28.6%. "

0,"Man  Utd  to  open  books  to  Glazer  |||    Manchester  United's  board  has  agreed  to  give  US  tycoon  Malcolm  Glazer  access  to  its  books.  |||    Earlier  this  month,  Mr  Glazer  presented  the  board  with  detailed  proposals  on  an  offer  to  buy  the  football  club.  In  a  statement,  the  club  said  it  would  allow  Mr  Glazer  ""limited  due  diligence""  to  give  him  the  opportunity  to  take  the  proposal  on  to  a  formal  bid.  But  it  said  it  continued  to  oppose  Mr  Glazer's  plans,  calling  his  assumptions  ""aggressive""  and  his  plan  ""damaging"".  Many  of  Manchester  United's  supporters  own  shares  in  the  club,  and  the  fan-based  group  Shareholders  United  is  strongly  opposed  to  any  takeover  by  Mr  Glazer.  About  300  fans  protested  outside  the  Old  Trafford  ground  two  days  ago.  |||    Rival  local  club  Manchester  City  has  pleaded  with  visiting  fans  not  to  protest  inside  its  ground  when  the  two  teams  play  a  televised  match  on  Sunday.  |||    Manchester  United's  response  comes  as  little  surprise,  as  the  board  made  clear.  ""Any  board  has  a  responsibility  to  consider  a  bona  fide  offer  proposal,""  the  club  said  in  its  statement.  Should  it  become  a  firm  offer,  it  should  be  at  a  price  that  ""the  board  is  likely  to  regard  as  fair""  and  on  terms  which  ""may  be  deliverable"".  But  it  also  stressed  that  it  stayed  opposed  to  Mr  Glazer's  proposal.  ""The  board  continues  to  believe  that  Mr  Glazer's  business  plan  assumptions  are  aggressive,""  the  statement  said,  ""and  the  direct  and  indirect  financial  strain  on  the  business  could  be  damaging.""  Whether  or  not  the  bid  is  attractive  in  monetary  terms,  in  the  case  of  Manchester  United  many  investors  hold  the  stock  for  sentimental  rather  than  financial  reasons.  At  present,  Mr  Glazer  and  his  family  hold  a  28.1%  stake,  making  them  Manchester  United's  second  biggest  shareholders.  They  own  the  successful  Tampa  Bay  Buccaneers  American  football  team  based  in  Florida.  If  the  family  makes  a  formal  offer,  they  will  need  the  support  of  the  club's  biggest  shareholders.  |||    Irish  horse  racing  millionaires  JP  McManus  and  John  Magnier  own  29%  of  United  through  their  investment  vehicle  Cubic  Expression,  and  have  yet  to  express  a  view  on  the  bid  approach.  |||    A  group  of  five  MPs  are  calling  on  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  to  block  any  takeover  of  the  club  by  the  US  football  magnate  on  public  interest  grounds.  They  have  signed  a  House  of  Commons  motion,  and  Tony  Lloyd,  the  Manchester  Central  MP,  whose  constituency  includes  the  club's  Old  Trafford  ground,  has  pledged  to  take  the  matter  ""to  Tony  Blair  if  necessary"".  The  Commons  motion  says  ""any  takeover  designed  to  transform  the  club  into  a  private  company  would  be  against  the  interests  of  those  supporters  and  football"".  However,  the  DTI  has  dismissed  the  proposal.  A  spokesman  said  the  department  did  not  believe  there  was  a  case  for  changing  the  Enterprise  Act  so  that  takeovers  of  football  clubs  could  be  looked  at  on  non-competition  grounds.  Mr  Glazer's  offer  values  the  club  at  £800m  ($1.5bn).  Pitched  at  300p  per  share,  it  also  relies  less  on  debt  to  finance  it  than  an  earlier  approach  from  the  US  tycoon,  which  was  rejected  out  of  hand.  Manchester  United  shares  closed  at  270.25p  on  Friday,  down  3.75p  on  the  day. "

0,"Russia  WTO  talks  'make  progress'  |||    Talks  on  Russia's  proposed  membership  of  the  World  Trade  Organisation  (WTO)  have  been  ""making  good  progress""  say  those  behind  the  negotiations.  |||    But  the  chairman  of  the  working  party,  Ambassador  Stefan  Johannesson  of  Iceland,  warned  that  there  was  ""still  a  lot  of  work  has  to  be  done"".  His  comments  came  as  President  George  W  Bush  said  the  US  backed  Russian  entry.  But  he  said  for  Russia  to  make  progress  the  government  must  ""renew  a  commitment  to  democracy  and  the  rule  of  law"".  His  comments  come  three  days  before  he  is  due  to  meet  President  Vladimir  Putin.  |||    Russia  has  been  waiting  for  a  decade  to  join  the  WTO  and  hopes  to  finally  become  a  member  by  early  2006.  A  decision  could  be  reached  in  December,  when  the  WTO's  148  current  members  gather  for  a  summit  in  Hong  Kong.  That  would  allow  an  earliest  date  for  membership  of  January  2006,  if  the  Hong  Kong  summit  gave  its  approval.  While  pinpointing  several  areas  in  which  there  are  difficulties  in  the  bilateral  and  multilateral  work  with  Russia,  the  US  said  the  meeting  was  ""much  more  efficient  than  we've  seen  for  some  time"".  And  Australia  said  it  was  ""one  of  the  best  (meetings)  we  can  recall  in  terms  of  substance"".  Mr  Johannesson  also  said  progress  ""on  the  bilateral  market  access  side  is  accelerating"".  Sticking  points  to  membership  have  included  limits  on  foreign  ownership  in  the  telecommunications  and  life  insurance  businesses,  as  well  as  issues  surrounding  counterfeiting,  piracy,  and  data  protection.  Some  WTO  members  also  dislike  Russia's  energy  price  subsidies,  which  competitors  say  give  Russian  businesses  an  unfair  advantage. "

2,"Labour  accused  of  'EU  propaganda'  |||    A  ""taxpayer  subsidised  propaganda  exercise""  on  the  EU  is  being  used  to  lull  the  British  public  into  a  false  sense  of  security,  say  the  Tories.  |||    Shadow  foreign  secretary  Michael  Ancram  told  MPs  a  new  White  Paper  was  part  of  trying  to  soften  up  opinion  ahead  of  the  referendum  on  the  EU  constitution.  His  claims  were  denied  by  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw,  who  accused  the  Tories  of  ""running  scared""  of  debate.  EU  cooperation  would  help  get  better  UK  immigration  controls,  he  argued.  |||    Mr  Straw  used  Thursday's  Commons  debate  to  launch  the  new  White  Paper  on  the  prospects  for  the  EU  in  2005.  Security,  stability  and  prosperity  would  be  the  key  themes  when  the  UK  took  over  the  chairmanship  of  the  EU  in  July,  said  Mr  Straw.  Africa  and  climate  change  would  also  feature  highly.  He  said  the  UK  was  trying  to  ensure  future  EU  budgets  were  limited  to  1%  of  Europe's  economic  output  and  were  spent  ""where  it  adds  most  value"".  Mr  Straw  promised  to  continue  to  ensure  the  UK's  budget  rebate,  secured  in  1984  by  Margaret  Thatcher,  was  ""fully  justified"".  ""We,  like  all  other  countries,  have  a  veto  on  any  changes  proposed  in  this  area,""  he  said.  |||    Mr  Ancram  condemned  the  document,  which  the  Foreign  Office  says  has  cost  about  £2,500  to  design,  print  and  deliver.  ""Isn't  the  reason  that  the  government  is  now  involved  in  a  taxpayer  subsidised  propaganda  exercise  to  try  to  sell  the  new  EU  to  the  country  in  advance  of  the  forthcoming  referendum  and  general  election?,""  he  asked.  The  Tory  spokesman  also  criticised  the  government  for  claiming  the  EU  constitution  would  make  Europe  easier  to  understand.  ""The  government,  last  week,  had  to  publish  a  commentary  of  500  pages  to  try  and  explain  this  'easy  and  simple'  constitution  to  the  British  people,""  he  said.  ""Who  are  they  trying  to  kid?""  The  proposed  question  for  the  constitution  referendum  is:  ""Should  the  United  Kingdom  approve  the  Treaty  establishing  a  Constitution  for  the  European  Union?""  The  Electoral  Commission  on  Thursday  said  it  was  satisfied  the  question  was  easy  to  understand.  The  government  has  suggested  the  referendum  on  the  constitution  could  take  place  in  spring  2006,  with  the  Tories  set  to  campaign  for  a  ""no""  vote.  |||    Mr  Ancram  said  ministers  were  prolonging  uncertainty  by  putting  the  vote  off  until  the  latest  date  possible.  The  foreign  secretary  hit  back  by  saying  Tory  attitudes  to  Europe  had  helped  keep  the  party  out  of  power  for  more  than  a  decade.  Mr  Straw  argued  cooperation  with  European  partners  could  bring  a  ""level  playing  field""  on  immigration  and  asylum  controls.  ""You  are  setting  your  face  against  all  of  these  things,""  he  added.  For  the  Liberal  Democrats,  Sir  Menzies  Campbell  said  the  UK  should  not  ignore  the  need  to  reform  the  EU  Common  Agricultural  Policy.  Change  was  particularly  important  for  developing  countries  wanting  access  to  markets,  he  argued.  Sir  Menzies  was  among  those  worried  about  plans,  backed  by  the  UK,  to  lift  the  arms  embargo  imposed  on  China  after  the  Tiananmen  Square  massacre.  Mr  Straw  said  no  decisions  had  been  taken  -  Chinese  human  rights  had  improved  but  not  by  enough. "

3,"Ferdinand  casts  doubt  over  Glazer  |||    Rio  Ferdinand  has  said  he  is  unsure  of  Malcolm  Glazer's  motives  after  the  American  billionaire  launched  a  new  offer  to  buy  Manchester  United.  |||    The  club  have  confirmed  that  the  Glazer  Family  Partnership  have  submitted  proposals  of  a  third  bid.  ""A  lot  of  people  want  the  club's  interest  to  be  with  people  who  have  grown  up  with  the  club  and  have  got  its  interests  at  heart,""  said  Ferdinand.  ""No  one  knows  what  this  guy  will  be  bringing  to  the  table.""  The  central  defender  added  on  BBC  Radio  Five  Live:  ""We  will  have  to  wait  and  see  what  Glazer  comes  with.  ""I  would  like  to  see  the  situation  resolved  either  way.  ""I  think  people  are  getting  bored  with  him  coming  in  and  out  of  the  news  with  new  proposals.  ""The  other  stuff  off  the  pitch  takes  the  shine  off  what  is  going  on  the  pitch.""  |||    Glazer,  currently  owns  a  28.1%  stake  in  the  club,  and  United's  statement  to  the  stock  exchange  said:  ""The  board  has  noted  the  recent  press  speculation  on  this  subject.  ""The  board  can  confirm  that  it  has  now  received  a  detailed  proposal  subject  to  various  pre-conditions  which  may  form  the  basis  of  an  offer  for  Manchester  United  from  Glazer.  ""A  further  announcement  will  be  made  in  due  course.""  Glazer's  previous  bids  for  the  club,  which  United  supporters  opposed,  were  rejected  by  the  board  because  of  the  high  level  of  debt  they  would  incur.  But  it  is  believed  that  Glazer  has  substantially  reduced  the  borrowing  required  for  his  latest  move.  He  will  still  need  the  approval  of  major  shareholders  John  Magnier  and  JP  McManus,  who  own  28.9%  of  the  club  to  succeed.  But  the  Irish  duo  have  cut  off  talks  with  Glazer  over  the  proposed  sale  of  their  stake,  while  fans  remain  opposed  to  his  involvement. "

1,"Wal-Mart  is  sued  over  rude  lyrics  |||    The  parents  of  a  13-year-old  girl  are  suing  US  supermarket  giant  Wal-Mart  over  a  CD  by  rock  group  Evanescence  that  contains  swear  words.  |||    The  lawsuit,  filed  in  Washington  County,  alleges  Wal-Mart  deceived  customers  by  not  putting  warning  labels  on  the  cover.  Trevin  Skeens  alleges  Wal-Mart  knew  of  the  offending  word  because  it  had  censored  it  on  its  music  sales  website.  Wal-Mart  said  it  was  investigating  the  claims  but  had  no  plans  to  pull  the  CD.  Wal-Mart  has  a  policy  of  not  stocking  CDs  which  carry  parental  advisory  labels.  Mr  Skeens  said  he  bought  the  Anywhere  But  Home  CD  for  his  daughter  and  was  shocked  to  hear  the  swearing  when  it  was  played  in  their  car.  |||    ""I  don't  want  any  other  families  to  get  this,  expecting  it  to  be  clean.  It  needs  to  be  removed  from  the  shelves  to  prevent  other  children  from  hearing  it,""  said  Mr  Skeens  of  Brownsville.  The  lawsuit  seeks  to  force  Wal-Mart  to  censor  the  music  or  remove  it  from  its  stores  in  Maryland.  It  also  seeks  damages  of  up  to  $74,500  (£38,660)  for  every  customer  who  bought  the  CD  at  Maryland  Wal-Marts,  and  also  naming  record  label  Wind-Up  Records  and  distributor  BMG  Entertainment  in  the  legal  action.  ""While  Wal-Mart  sets  high  standards,  it  would  not  be  possible  to  eliminate  every  image,  word  or  topic  that  an  individual  might  find  objectionable,""  Wal-Mart  spokesman  Guy  Whitcomb  told  the  Herald-Mail  of  Hagerstown.

Klinsmann  said:  ""It  will  be  difficult  for  any  of  our  players  if  he  is  not  a  first-choice  at  his  club.  ""If  Jens  is  not  Arsenal's  number  one  keeper,  that  is  a  problem  for  me.  He  must  be  playing  regularly.""  Lehmann  is  desperate  to  keep  his  place  in  the  Germany  squad  when  the  country  hosts  the  World  Cup  in  2006.  Klinsmann  added:  ""If  he  is  not  playing  regularly  he  cannot  be  Germany's  number  one  keeper,  or  even  number  two  keeper.  ""The  situation  for  Jens  is  that  he  is  currently  the  number  two  keeper  at  Arsenal.  This  could  be  critical  if  it  remains  the  same  during  next  season."" "

0,"BA  to  suspend  two  Saudi  services  |||    British  Airways  is  to  halt  its  flights  from  London  Heathrow  to  Jeddah  and  Riyadh  in  Saudi  Arabia  from  27  March.  |||    The  airline  said  the  decision  was  a  commercial  one  due  to  reduced  passenger  demand  for  the  services.  BA  currently  operates  four  flights  per  week  from  Heathrow  to  Jeddah,  and  three  weekly  journeys  to  Riyadh.  It  suspended  flights  to  Saudi  Arabia  for  three  weeks  in  autumn  2003  after  a  government  warning  about  a  ""threat  to  UK  aviation  interests  in  Saudi  Arabia"".  |||    BA  will  now  suspend  the  Saudi  flights  -  which  it  says  will  remain  ""under  constant  review""  -  from  27  March.  ""The  decision  to  suspend  flights  between  the  UK  and  Saudi  Arabia  is  a  difficult  one  to  make  as  we  have  enjoyed  a  long  history  of  flying  between  the  two  countries,""  said  BA  director  of  commercial  planning,  Robert  Boyle.  ""However,  the  routes  don't  currently  make  a  profitable  contribution  to  our  business  and  we  are  unable  to  sustain  them  while  this  remains  the  case.""  Passengers  with  flights  booked  after  the  suspension  date  will  be  contacted  by  BA  for  alternative  arrangements  to  be  made. "

0,"Parmalat  to  return  to  stockmarket  |||    Parmalat,  the  Italian  dairy  company  which  went  bust  after  an  accounting  scandal,  hopes  to  be  back  on  the  Italian  stock  exchange  in  July.  |||    The  firm  gained  protection  from  creditors  in  2003  after  revealing  debts  of  14bn  euros  ($18.34bn;  £9.6bn).  This  was  eight  times  higher  than  it  had  previously  stated.  In  a  statement  issued  on  Wednesday  night,  Parmalat  Finanziaria  detailed  administrators'  latest  plans  for  re-listing  the  shares  of  the  group.  |||    As  part  of  the  re-listing  on  the  Italian  stock  exchange,  creditors'  debts  are  expected  to  be  converted  into  shares  through  two  new  share  issues  amounting  to  more  than  2bn  euros.  The  company's  creditors  will  be  asked  to  vote  on  the  plan  later  this  year.  The  plan  is  likely  to  give  creditors  of  Parmalat  Finanziaria  shares  worth  about  5.7%  of  the  debts  they  are  owed.  This  is  lower  than  the  11.3%  creditors  previously  hoped  to  receive.  Creditors  of  Parmalat,  the  main  operating  company,  are  likely  to  see  the  percentage  of  debt  they  receive  fall  from  7.3%  to  6.9%.  |||    Several  former  top  Parmalat  executives  are  under  investigation  for  the  fraud  scandal.  Lawmakers  said  on  Wednesday  night  Enrico  Bondi,  the  turnaround  specialist  appointed  by  the  Italian  government  as  Parmalat's  chief  executive,  spoke  positively  about  the  company  during  a  closed-door  hearing  of  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  industry  commission.  ""Bondi  supplied  us  with  elements  of  positive  results  on  the  industrial  positions  and  on  the  history  of  debt  which  will  find  a  point  of  solution  through  the  Parmalat  group's  quotation  on  the  market  in  July,""  Italian  news  agency  Apcom  quoted  several  lawmakers  as  saying  in  a  statement.

0,"Dollar  hits  new  low  versus  euro  |||    The  US  dollar  has  continued  its  record-breaking  slide  and  has  tumbled  to  a  new  low  against  the  euro.  |||    Investors  are  betting  that  the  European  Central  Bank  (ECB)  will  not  do  anything  to  weaken  the  euro,  while  the  US  is  thought  to  favour  a  declining  dollar.  The  US  is  struggling  with  a  ballooning  trade  deficit  and  analysts  said  one  of  the  easiest  ways  to  fund  it  was  by  allowing  a  depreciation  of  the  dollar.  They  have  predicted  that  the  dollar  is  likely  to  fall  even  further.  |||    The  US  currency  was  trading  at  $1.364  per  euro  at  1800  GMT  on  Monday.  This  compares  with  $1.354  to  the  euro  in  late  trading  in  New  York  on  Friday,  which  was  then  a  record  low.  |||    The  dollar  has  weakened  sharply  since  September  when  it  traded  about  $1.20  against  the  euro.  It  has  lost  7%  this  year,  while  against  the  Japanese  yen  it  is  down  3.2%.  Traders  said  that  thin  trading  levels  had  amplified  Monday's  move.  ""It's  not  going  to  take  much  to  push  [the  dollar]  one  way  or  the  other,""  said  Grant  Wilson  of  Mellon  Bank.

1,"Ray  DVD  beats  box  office  takings  |||    Oscar-nominated  film  biopic  Ray  has  surpassed  its  US  box  office  takings  with  a  combined  tally  of  $80m  (£43m)  from  DVD  and  video  sales  and  rentals.  |||    Ray's  success  on  DVD  outstripped  its  $74m  (£40m)  US  box  office  total,  earning  more  than  $40m  (£22m)  on  the  first  day  of  the  DVD's  release  alone.  Ray  has  been  nominated  in  six  Oscar  categories  including  best  film  and  best  actor  for  Jamie  Foxx.  The  film  recounts  the  life  of  blues  singer  Ray  Charles,  who  died  in  2004.  In  its  first  week  on  home  entertainment  release  the  film  was  the  number  one  selling  DVD,  with  the  limited  edition  version  coming  in  at  number  11.  Sony  horror  film  The  Grudge,  starring  Michelle  Gellar,  was  the  US'  second  best-selling  DVD,  with  Jennifer  Lopez  and  Richard  Gere's  romantic  comedy  Shall  We  Dance?  at  number  three.  Foxx's  critically  acclaimed  performance  as  Ray  has  already  earned  him  a  Screen  Actors  Guild  Award  for  best  actor,  as  well  as  a  prestigious  Golden  Globe.  Ray  director  Taylor  Hackford,  responsible  for  the  classic  1982  film  An  Officer  and  a  Gentleman,  has  also  received  an  Oscar  nomination  in  the  best  director  category.  The  film's  three  other  Oscar  nominations  are  for  costume,  film  editing  and  sound  mixing. "

0,"US  trade  gap  hits  record  in  2004  |||    The  gap  between  US  exports  and  imports  hit  an  all-time  high  of  $671.7bn  (£484bn)  in  2004,  latest  figures  show.  |||    The  Commerce  Department  said  the  trade  deficit  for  all  of  last  year  was  24.4%  above  the  previous  record  -  2003's  imbalance  of  $496.5bn.  The  deficit  with  China,  up  30.5%  at  $162bn,  was  the  largest  ever  recorded  with  a  single  country.  However,  on  a  monthly  basis  the  US  trade  gap  narrowed  by  4.9%  in  December  to  £56.4bn.  The  US  consumer's  appetite  for  all  things  from  oil  to  imported  cars,  and  even  wine  and  cheese,  reached  record  levels  last  year  and  the  figures  are  likely  to  spark  fresh  criticism  of  President  Bush's  economic  policies.  |||    Democrats  claim  the  administration  has  not  done  enough  to  clamp  down  on  unfair  foreign  trade  practices.  For  example,  they  believe  China's  currency  policy  -  which  US  manufacturers  claim  has  undervalued  the  yuan  by  as  much  as  40%  -  has  given  China's  rapidly  expanding  economy  an  unfair  advantage  against  US  competitors.  |||    Meanwhile,  the  Bush  administration  argues  that  the  US  deficit  reflects  the  fact  the  America  is  growing  at  faster  rate  than  the  rest  of  the  world,  spurring  on  more  demand  for  imported  goods.  Some  economists  say  this  may  allow  an  upward  revision  of  US  economic  growth  in  the  fourth  quarter.  But  others  point  out  that  the  deficit  has  reached  such  astronomical  proportions  that  foreigners  many  choose  not  to  hold  as  many  dollar-denominated  assets,  which  may  in  turn  harm  growth.  For  all  of  2004,  US  exports  rose  12.3%  to  $1.15  trillion,  but  imports  rose  even  faster  by  16.3%  to  a  new  record  of  $1.76  trillion.  Foreign  oil  exports  surged  by  35.7%  to  a  record  $180.7bn,  reflecting  the  rally  in  global  oil  prices  and  increasing  domestic  demand.  Imports  were  not  affected  by  the  dollar's  weakness  last  year.  ""We  expect  the  deficit  to  continue  to  widen  in  2005  even  if  the  dollar  gets  back  to  its  downward  trend,""  said  economist  Marie-Pierre  Ripert  at  IXIS. "

0,"Iranian  MPs  threaten  mobile  deal  |||    Turkey's  biggest  private  mobile  firm  could  bail  out  of  a  $3bn  ($1.6bn)  deal  to  build  a  network  in  Iran  after  MPs  there  slashed  its  stake  in  the  project.  |||    Conservatives  in  parliament  say  Turkcell's  stake  in  Irancell,  the  new  network,  should  be  cut  from  70%  to  49%.  They  have  already  given  themselves  a  veto  over  all  foreign  investment  deals,  following  allegations  about  Turkish  firms'  involvement  in  Israel.  Turkcell  now  says  it  may  give  up  on  the  deal  altogether.  |||    Iran  currently  has  only  one  heavily  congested  mobile  network,  with  long  waiting  lists  for  new  subscribers.  Turkcell  signed  a  contract  for  the  new  network  in  September.  The  new  operator  planned  to  offer  subscriptions  for  about  $180,  well  below  the  existing  firm's  $500  price  tag.  But  a  parliamentary  commission  has  now  ruled  that  Turkcell's  70%  controlling  stake  is  too  high.  They  say  that  Turkcell  is  a  security  risk  because  of  alleged  business  ties  with  Israel.  Parliament  as  a  whole  -  dominated  by  religious  conservatives  -  will  vote  on  the  ruling  on  Tuesday.  |||    Turkcell  said  the  ruling  would  ""make  more  difficult...  Turkcell's  financial  consolidation  of  Irancell""  because  its  stake  would  be  reduced  to  less  than  50%.  ""If  management  control  and  financial  consolidation  of  Irancell  cannot  be  achieved...  the  realisation  of  the  project  will  become  risky,""  it  warned  in  a  statement.  The  firm  has  refused  to  comment  on  whether  it  has  business  dealings  in  Israel,  although  like  almost  all  GSM  operators  worldwide  it  has  an  interconnection  deal  with  Israeli  networks  so  that  its  customers  can  use  their  phones  there.  The  two  countries  strengthened  ties  in  both  defence  and  economic  issues  in  2004.  Israeli  industry  minister  Ehud  Olmert  was  reported  in  June  to  have  attended  a  meeting  between  Ruhi  Dogusoy,  Turkcell's  chief  operating  officer,  and  executives  from  Israeli  telecoms  firms.  Telecoms  is  one  of  two  areas  specifically  targeted  by  the  new  veto  law  on  foreign  investments,  passed  earlier  in  September.  The  other  is  airports,  a  source  of  controversy  after  the  army  closed  Tehran's  new  Imam  Khomeini  International  Airport  on  its  opening  day  in  May  2004.  Again,  the  allegation  was  that  the  part-Turkish  TAV  consortium  which  built  and  ran  it  had  links  with  Israel. "

May  said:  ""Suddenly  the  Queen  Phoenix  is  rising  again  from  the  ashes  and  will  take  precedence  over...  our  lives.""  Queen  have  played  with  many  different  singers  since  Mercury's  death  in  1991  but  have  reportedly  not  toured.  May  performed  with  Rodgers  at  a  concert  to  celebrate  the  50th  anniversary  of  the  Fender  Stratocaster  guitar  in  London  in  September.  |||    ""We  were  both  so  amazed  at  the  chemistry  that  was  going  on  in  [Free  hit]  All  Right  Now,  that  suddenly  it  seems  blindingly  obvious  that  there  was  'something  happening  here,'""  May  wrote  on  his  website.  They  teamed  up  again  for  a  concert  to  mark  their  induction  into  the  UK  Music  Hall  of  Fame,  and  were  joined  by  Taylor.  ""The  show  went  so  incredibly  well  from  our  point  of  view,  and  we  got  so  many  rave  reactions  from  out  there,  we  decided  almost  then  and  there  that  we  would  look  at  a  tour  together,""  May  wrote.  |||    Queen  went  to  number  one  in  2000  with  a  version  of  We  Will  Rock  You  sung  by  boy  band  5ive  and  they  have  also  played  with  Robbie  Williams,  Will  Young  and  Bob  Geldof.

0,"Russia  gets  investment  blessing  |||    Soaring  oil  sales  and  a  budget  surplus  mean  Russian  debt  is  no  longer  a  risky  investment,  one  of  the  world's  leading  credit  rating  agencies  says.  |||    Standard  &  Poor's  has  classed  Russian  bonds  as  ""investment  grade"",  up  from  their  former  ""speculative""  rating.  Russia's  reputation  among  investors  has  been  hurt  in  recent  months  by  the  heavy  tax  bills  and  asset  seizures  imposed  on  companies  such  as  oil  giant  Yukos.  S&P  said  the  solidity  of  government  finances  outweighed  the  risk.  Russia  is  now  a  net  creditor  rather  than  a  debtor.  Gold  and  foreign  currency  reserves  of  $119bn  beat  its  foreign  public  debt  of  some  $113bn.  |||    The  other  two  major  ratings  agencies  -  Fitch  and  Moody's  have  long  since  upped  their  rating  of  Russia's  sovereign  debt.  S&P  had  held  back  through  fear  that  the  government  was  dragging  its  feet  on  economic  and  legal  reforms.  Now,  though,  it  has  finally  followed  suit.  But  the  agency  made  it  clear  that  the  improved  rating  did  not  mean  that  the  risks  were  a  thing  of  the  past.  Instead,  with  Russian  government  coffers  brimming  with  tax  revenues  from  energy  sales,  S&P  said  the  government's  own  debt  is  looking  a  good  bet.  ""These  improvements  are  so  significant  that  they  now  outweight  the  serious  and  growing  political  risk  that  continues  to  be  a  key  ratings  constraint  on  Russia,""  wrote  S&P  credit  analyst  Helena  Hessel.  |||    The  Yukos  saga  is  the  most  high-profile  of  the  political  risks  to  which  Ms  Hessel  alludes.  The  company's  founder  and  ex-chief  executive,  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky,  is  in  jail  on  trial  for  tax  evasion  and  fraud.  Many  believe  the  real  motive  for  his  prosecution  is  that  he  threatened  to  use  his  wealth  to  set  up  a  political  alternative  to  President  Vladimir  Putin.  His  company,  meanwhile,  is  widely  believed  to  have  fallen  victim  to  the  Kremlin's  wish  to  get  Russian  energy  resources  as  far  as  possible  back  under  state  control. "

0,"Cairn  shares  up  on  new  oil  find  |||    Shares  in  Cairn  Energy  have  jumped  6%  after  the  firm  said  an  Indian  oilfield  was  larger  than  previously  thought.  |||    Cairn  said  drilling  to  the  north-west  of  its  development  site  in  Rajasthan  had  produced  ""very  strong  results"".  The  company  also  said  it  now  believed  the  development  area  would  be  able  to  produce  oil  for  more  than  25  years.  Cairn's  share  price  rose  300%  last  year  after  a  number  of  oil  finds,  but  its  shares  were  hit  in  December  following  a  disappointing  drilling  update.  December's  share  fall  means  that  Cairn  is  still  in  danger  of  being  relegated  from  the  FTSE  100  when  the  index  is  reshuffled  next  month.  Cairn's  shares  closed  up  64  pence,  or  6%,  at  1130p  on  Thursday.  |||    Before  Christmas,  Cairn  revealed  that  drilling  to  the  north  of  the  field  in  Rajasthan  had  been  disappointing,  which  caused  its  shares  to  lose  18%  in  one  day.  |||    However,  on  Thursday,  the  group  said  its  belief  that  the  path  of  oil  in  the  area  actually  moved  further  to  the  west  had  proved  correct.  ""This  area  does  need  more  appraisal  drilling  but  it  looks  very  strong,""  Dr  Mike  Watts  head  of  exploration  said.  Chief  executive  Bill  Gammell  added:  ""The  more  we  progress  in  Rajasthan  the  better  we  feel  about  it.""  Cairn  made  the  discovery  after  having  been  granted  an  extension  to  their  drilling  licence  in  January  by  Indian  authorities.  The  firm  has  applied  for  a  30-month  extension  to  scout  for  oil  outside  its  main  development  area,  which  includes  the  Mangala  and  Aishwariya  fields  where  Cairn  has  previously  announced  major  discoveries.  It  also  said  production  at  its  other  fields  across  the  globe  was  likely  to  surpass  levels  seen  in  2004. "

0,"Tokyo  says  deflation  'controlled'  |||    The  Japanese  government  has  forecast  that  the  country's  economic  growth  will  slow  to  1.6%  in  the  next  fiscal  year  starting  in  April  2005.  |||    While  it  predicts  this  fall  from  the  current  2.1%  level,  it  said  it  was  making  progress  on  ending  deflation.  The  figures  were  given  by  economics  minister  Heizo  Takenaka  who  said  the  economy  would  grow  by  2%  in  2006/07.  He  said  the  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  would  rise  0.1%  in  the  next  fiscal  year,  the  first  gain  since  2000/01.  ""We  are  attempting  to  make  real  economic  conditions  better  and  to  overcome  deflation.  I  think  we  are  on  track,""  said  Mr  Takenaka.  Deflation  -  or  falling  consumer  prices  -  has  plagued  Japan  for  more  than  five  years.  To  ease  the  problem  the  Bank  of  Japan  has  regularly  flooded  the  money  market  with  excess  cash  to  keep  short  term  interest  rates  at  0%  in  an  attempt  to  spur  economic  activity.

2,"Women  MPs  reveal  sexist  taunts  |||    Women  MPs  endure  ""shocking""  levels  of  sexist  abuse  at  the  hands  of  their  male  counterparts,  a  new  study  shows.  |||    Male  MPs  pretended  to  juggle  imaginary  breasts  and  jeered  ""melons""  as  women  made  Commons  speeches,  researchers  from  Birkbeck  College  were  told.  Labour's  Yvette  Cooper  said  she  found  it  hard  to  persuade  Commons  officials  she  was  a  minister  and  not  a  secretary.  Some  83  MPs  gave  their  answers  in  100  hours  of  taped  interviews  for  the  study  ""Whose  Secretary  are  You,  minister"".  |||    The  research  team,  under  Professor  Joni  Lovenduski,  had  set  out  to  look  at  the  achievements  and  experiences  of  women  at  Westminster.  But  what  emerged  was  complaints  from  MPs  of  all  parties  of  sexist  barracking  in  the  Chamber,  sexist  insults  and  patronising  assumptions  about  their  abilities.  Barbara  Follet,  one  of  the  so-called  ""Blair  Babes""  elected  in  1997,  told  researchers:  ""I  remember  some  Conservatives  -  whenever  a  Labour  woman  got  up  to  speak  they  would  take  their  breasts  -  imaginary  breasts  -  in  their  hands  and  wiggle  them  and  say  'melons'  as  we  spoke.""  Former  Liberal  Democrat  MP  Jackie  Ballard  recalled  a  stream  of  remarks  from  a  leading  MP  on  topics  such  as  women's  legs  or  their  sexual  persuasion.  And  ex-Tory  education  secretary  Gillian  Shepherd  remembered  how  one  of  her  male  colleagues  called  all  women  ""Betty"".  |||    ""When  I  said,  'Look  you  know  my  name  isn't  Betty',  he  said,  'ah  but  you're  all  the  same,  so  I  call  you  all  Betty'.""  Harriet  Harman  told  researchers  of  the  sheer  hostility  prompted  by  her  advancement  to  the  Cabinet:  ""Well,  you've  only  succeeded  because  you're  a  woman.""  Another  current  member  of  the  Cabinet  says  she  was  told:  ""Oh,  you've  had  a  very  fast  rise,  who  have  you  been  sleeping  with?""  Even  after  the  great  influx  of  women  MPs  at  the  1997  general  election,  and  greater  numbers  of  women  in  the  Cabinet,  female  MPs  often  say  they  feel  stuck  on  the  edge  of  a  male  world.  |||    Liberal  Democrat  Sarah  Teather,  the  most  recent  female  MP  to  be  elected,  told  researchers:  ""Lots  of  people  say  it's  like  an  old  boys  club.  ""I've  always  said  to  me  it  feels  more  like  a  teenage  public  school  -  you  know  a  public  school  full  of  teenagers.""  Prof  Joni  Lovenduski,  who  conducted  the  study  with  the  help  of  Margaret  Moran  MP  and  a  team  of  journalists,  said  she  was  shocked  at  the  findings.  ""We  expected  a  bit  of  this  but  nothing  like  this  extent.  We  expected  to  find  a  couple  of  shocking  episodes.""  But  she  said  there  was  a  difference  between  the  experiences  of  women  before  the  1997  intake  and  afterwards.  This  was  mainly  because  there  were  more  women  present  in  Parliament  who  were  not  prepared  to  ""put  up  with""  the  sexist  attitudes  they  came  across,  Prof  Lovenduski  said.  But  she  added:  ""Some  women,  including  the  women  who  came  in  1997,  received  extraordinary  treatment  and  I  am  not  convinced  that  if  the  number  of  women  changed  back  to  what  it  was  before  1997  that  things  would  not  change  back.  ""What  I  think  is  shocking  to  the  general  public  is  that  these  things  go  on  in  the  House  of  Commons.""  The  interviews  are  to  be  placed  in  the  British  Library  as  a  historical  record. "

0,"JP  Morgan  admits  US  slavery  links  |||    Thousands  of  slaves  were  accepted  as  collateral  for  loans  by  two  banks  that  later  became  part  of  JP  Morgan  Chase.  |||    The  admission  is  part  of  an  apology  sent  to  JP  Morgan  staff  after  the  bank  researched  its  links  to  slavery  in  order  to  meet  legislation  in  Chicago.  Citizens  Bank  and  Canal  Bank  are  the  two  lenders  that  were  identified.  They  are  now  closed,  but  were  linked  to  Bank  One,  which  JP  Morgan  bought  last  year.  About  13,000  slaves  were  used  as  loan  collateral  between  1831  and  1865.  |||    Because  of  defaults  by  plantation  owners,  Citizens  and  Canal  ended  up  owning  about  1,250  slaves.  ""We  all  know  slavery  existed  in  our  country,  but  it  is  quite  different  to  see  how  our  history  and  the  institution  of  slavery  were  intertwined,""  JP  Morgan  chief  executive  William  Harrison  and  chief  operating  officer  James  Dimon  said  in  the  letter.  ""Slavery  was  tragically  ingrained  in  American  society,  but  that  is  no  excuse.""  ""We  apologise  to  the  African-American  community,  particularly  those  who  are  descendants  of  slaves,  and  to  the  rest  of  the  American  public  for  the  role  that  Citizens  Bank  and  Canal  Bank  played.""  ""The  slavery  era  was  a  tragic  time  in  US  history  and  in  our  company's  history.""  JP  Morgan  said  that  it  was  setting  up  a  $5m  scholarship  programme  for  students  living  in  Louisiana,  the  state  where  the  events  took  place.  The  bank  said  that  it  is  a  ""very  different  company  than  the  Citizens  and  Canal  Banks  of  the  1800s"". "

0,"South  African  car  demand  surges  |||    Car  manufacturers  with  plants  in  South  Africa,  including  BMW,  General  Motors,  Toyota  and  Volkswagen,  have  seen  a  surge  in  demand  during  2004.  |||    New  vehicle  sales  jumped  22%  to  449,603  from  a  year  earlier,  the  National  Association  of  Automobile  Manufacturers  of  South  Africa  (NAAMSA)  said.  Strong  economic  growth  and  low  interest  rates  have  driven  demand,  and  analysts  expect  the  trend  to  continue.  NAAMSA  said  it  expects  sales  to  top  500,000  in  2005.  During  2004  ""South  Africa  was  one  of  the  best  performing  markets  internationally""  for  car  sales,  NAAMSA  said.  While  domestic  demand  is  set  to  continue  to  enjoy  rapid  growth,  foreign  sales  could  come  under  pressure,  analysts  said.  The  vehicle  industry  accounts  for  about  13%  of  South  Africa's  total  exports.  However,  the  world  auto  market  has  its  problems  and  analysts  warn  that  overcapacity  and  the  strength  of  the  rand  could  hit  exports. "

2,"Petrol  duties  frozen,  Brown  says  |||    Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  has  announced  a  freeze  on  fuel  duty  in  his  pre-budget  speech  to  the  Commons  on  Thursday.  |||    Mr  Brown  told  the  House  that  government  policy  is  to  raise  fuel  duty  at  least  in  line  with  inflation  each  year  to  fulfil  environmental  commitments.  But  this  financial  year,  because  of  ""volatility  in  the  oil  market"",  he  said  the  duty  would  be  frozen.  During  2000  many  motorists  campaigned  against  the  rises  but  environmentalists  believe  less  duty  means  more  pollution.  He  said:  ""It  is  our  policy  that  each  year  fuel  duties  should  rise  at  least  in  line  with  inflation  as  we  seek  to  meet  our  targets  for  reducing  polluting  emmissions  and  fund  our  public  services.  ""But  this  financial  year  because  of  the  sustained  volatility  in  the  oil  market  I  propose  to  match  the  freeze  in  car  vehicle  licence  duty  with  a  continuation  on  the  freeze  on  the  main  road  fuel  duties.""  |||    The  RAC  welcomed  the  news,  calling  it  an  ""early  Christmas  present""  for  motorists.  But  the  organisation  urged  drivers  to  continue  to  shop  around  to  get  the  best  price  for  petrol.  Environmental  group  Transport  2000  said  the  freeze  sends  the  wrong  message  to  motorists.  ""We  are  concerned  that  although  Britain  leads  the  world  in  rhetoric  about  climate  change  it  often  fails  in  practical  action,""  said  a  spokesman.  In  2000  the  People's  Fuel  Lobby  caused  chaos  by  blocking  roads  with  slow-moving  convoys  after  Mr  Brown  threatened  to  raise  fuel  taxes.  The  chancellor  did  not  raise  duty  that  year,  but  despite  threats  of  more  protests  in  2003,  he  added  1.28p  per  litre. "

West  Yorkshire  police  confirmed  they  had  arrested  a  45-year-old  man  from  outside  their  area.  BNP  founding  chairman  John  Tyndall  was  arrested  on  Sunday  on  the  same  charge.  |||    In  July,  the  BBC  documentary  Secret  Agent  featured  covertly-filmed  footage  of  BNP  activists.  Mr  Griffin  is  the  twelfth  man  to  be  arrested  following  the  documentary.  Nine  men  from  West  Yorkshire  and  another  man  from  Leicester  have  been  arrested  and  freed  on  bail.  Seven  of  the  men  had  been  held  variously  in  connection  with  suspected  racially  aggravated  public  order  offences,  conspiracy  to  commit  criminal  damage  and  possession  of  a  firearm.  Two  men,  both  from  Keighley,  were  arrested  in  September  on  suspicion  of  conspiracy  to  commit  criminal  damage.  A  24-year-old  man  from  Leicester  was  detained  on  Monday  on  suspicion  of  incitement  to  commit  racial  hatred.

1,"Moreno  debut  makes  Oscar  mark  |||    Catalina  Sandino  Moreno  has  joined  a  rare  group  of  actresses  who  have  been  nominated  for  an  Oscar  for  starring  in  a  foreign  language  film.  |||    The  Colombian-born  actress  was  the  final  hope  for  director  Joshua  Marston,  who  scoured  the  US  and  Colombia  for  a  lead  for  Maria  Full  of  Grace.  The  film  sees  the  23-year-old  play  a  teenage  drug  mule  who  smuggles  heroin  by  swallowing  pellets  in  condoms.  Plaudits  have  been  raining  down  on  her  for  her  gritty  performance,  making  it  all  the  more  surprising  that  this  is  her  first  film.  Her  previous  acting  experience  was  in  amateur  productions  in  her  home  city  of  Bogota  at  the  Ruben  Di  Pietro  theatre  academy.  She  has  already  received  a  nomination  for  the  Independent  Spirit  Awards  leading  actress  category  but  these  rarely  overlap  with  Academy  Awards,  instead  recognising  quirkier,  low-budget  films.  And  at  the  2004  Berlin  Film  Festival  the  jury  could  not  choose  between  her  and  Charlize  Theron's  Oscar  winning  performance  in  Monster  so  gave  them  a  tied  award.  Sandino  Moreno  is  now  being  regarded  as  one  of  the  most  promising  actresses  around  at  the  moment.  But  she  is  taking  her  time  committing  to  her  next  project,  hoping  to  land  a  strong  Spanish  script  and  would  love  to  be  able  to  work  with  directors  Pedro  Almodovar  or  Alejandro  Amenabar.

0,"UK  house  prices  dip  in  November  |||    UK  house  prices  dipped  slightly  in  November,  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  (ODPM)  has  said.  |||    The  average  house  price  fell  marginally  to  £180,226,  from  £180,444  in  October.  Recent  evidence  has  suggested  that  the  UK  housing  market  is  slowing  after  interest  rate  increases,  and  economists  forecast  a  drop  in  prices  during  2005.  But  while  the  monthly  figures  may  hint  at  a  cooling  of  the  market,  annual  house  price  inflation  is  still  strong,  up  13.8%  in  the  year  to  November.  Economists,  however,  forecast  that  ODPM  figures  are  likely  to  show  a  weakening  in  annual  house  price  growth  in  coming  months.  ""Overall,  the  housing  market  activity  is  slowing  down  and  that  is  backed  up  by  the  mortgage  lending  and  the  mortgage  approvals  data,""  said  Mark  Miller,  at  HBOS  Treasury  Services.  ""The  ODPM  data  is  a  fairly  lagging  indicator.""  |||    The  figures  come  after  the  Bank  of  England  said  the  number  of  mortgages  approved  in  the  UK  has  fallen  to  the  lowest  level  for  nearly  a  decade.  The  Halifax,  meanwhile,  said  last  week  that  house  prices  increased  by  1.1%  in  December  -  the  first  monthly  rise  since  September.  |||    The  UK's  biggest  mortgage  lender  said  prices  rose  15.1%  over  the  whole  of  2004,  but  by  only  2.8%  in  the  second  half  of  the  year.  It  is  predicting  a  2%  fall  in  overall  prices  in  2005  as  the  market  stabilises  after  large  gains  in  recent  years.  The  ODPM  attributed  the  monthly  fall  of  prices  in  November  to  a  drop  in  the  value  of  detached  houses  and  flats.  It  said  annual  inflation  rose  between  October  and  November  because  prices  had  fallen  by  1.1%  in  the  same  period  in  2003.  |||    The  ODPM  data  showed  the  average  house  price  was  £192,713  in  England;  £139,544  in  Wales;  £116,542  in  Scotland,  and  £111,314  in  Northern  Ireland.  |||    All  areas  saw  a  rise  in  annual  house  price  inflation  in  November  except  for  Northern  Ireland  and  the  West  Midlands,  where  the  rate  was  unchanged,  the  ODPM  said.  The  North  East  showed  the  highest  rate  of  inflation  at  26.2%,  followed  by  Yorkshire  and  the  Humber  on  21.7%,  and  the  North  West  on  21.1%.  The  East  Midlands,  the  West  Midlands  and  the  South  West  all  had  an  annual  inflation  rate  of  more  than  15%.  In  London,  the  area  with  the  highest  average  house  price  at  £262,825,  annual  inflation  rose  only  slightly  in  November  to  7.1%  from  7%  the  previous  month. "

0,"UK  Coal  plunges  into  deeper  loss  |||    Shares  in  UK  Coal  have  fallen  after  the  mining  group  reported  losses  had  deepened  to  £51.6m  in  2004  from  £1.2m.  |||    The  UK's  biggest  coal  producer  blamed  geological  problems,  industrial  action  and  ""operating  flaws""  at  its  deep  mines  for  its  worsening  fortunes.  The  South  Yorkshire  company,  led  by  new  chief  executive  Gerry  Spindler,  said  it  hoped  to  return  to  profit  in  2006.  In  early  trade  on  Thursday,  its  shares  were  down  10%  at  119  pence.  UK  Coal  said  it  was  making  ""significant  progress""  in  shaking  up  the  business.  It  had  introduced  new  wage  structures,  a  new  daily  maintenance  regime  for  machinery  at  its  mines  and  methods  to  continue  mining  in  adverse  conditions.  The  company  said  these  actions  should  ""significantly  uplift  earnings"".  It  expected  2005  to  be  a  ""transitional  year""  and  to  return  to  profitability  in  2006.  |||    The  recent  rise  in  coal  prices  has  failed  to  benefit  the  company  as  most  of  its  output  had  already  been  sold,  it  said.  Total  production  costs  were  £1.30  per  gigajoule,  UK  Coal  said,  but  the  average  selling  price  was  just  £1.18  per  gigajoule.  ""We  have  a  long  journey  ahead  to  fix  these  issues.  We  continue  to  make  progress  and  great  strides  have  already  been  made,""  said  Mr  Spindler.  UK  Coal  operates  15  deep  and  surface  mines  across  Nottinghamshire,  Derbyshire,  Leicestershire,  Yorkshire,  the  West  Midlands,  Northumberland  and  Durham. "

1,"Mogul  Wilson  backing  UK  rap  band  |||    Tony  Wilson,  the  music  mogul  who  established  the  influential  Factory  Records  in  the  1980s,  is  to  launch  a  new  label  -  convinced  he  has  discovered  his  ""third  major  band"".  |||    Factory  were  the  label  of  both  Joy  Division  -  who  became  New  Order  after  singer  Ian  Curtis  committed  suicide  -  and  the  Happy  Mondays.  Now  Wilson  believes  rap  act  Raw  T  -  signed  to  his  F4  label,  the  fourth  incarnation  of  Factory  -  will  ""complete  the  hat-trick"".  ""Suddenly,  when  Raw  T  came  into  my  life,  I  realised  they  are  my  third  major  band,""  he  told  BBC  World  Service's  The  Music  Biz  programme.  The  group  are  set  to  release  their  first  single  on  21  February,  and  follow  it  up  with  an  album,  Realise  And  Witness,  in  March.  |||    Wilson  has  twice  tried  to  resurrect  Factory  -  which  lasted  for  14  years  before  folding  -  but  conceded  these  efforts  had  been  ""despondent  and  dismal  experiences"".  But  it  has  not  put  him  off.  ""Of  all  the  things  I  do  in  my  life  the  most  exciting  thing  I've  ever  done,  and  the  thing  I  have  most  loved,  is  being  part  of  a  record  company,""  he  added.  |||    ""The  idea  of  working  with  brilliant  young  musicians,  and  being  close  to  the  centre  of  popular  culture,  is  just  the  biggest  thrill  in  my  life.""  Wilson  explained  how  his  son  persuaded  him  to  go  and  see  Raw  T,  but  he  had  initially  been  reluctant  saying  he  ""detested""  young  British  people  rapping.  ""It's  always  inauthentic,  it's  always  crass,  it  never  really  works  for  me,""  he  said.  ""I  went  to  see  this  group,  Raw  T  -  which  stands  for  Realise  And  Witness  Talent  -  and  like  everyone  else  in  the  room  that  night,  we  were  utterly  blown  away.""  Wilson  believes  Raw  T  could  be  ""to  F4  as  Joy  Division  were  to  Factory  records"".  |||    The  story  of  Factory  records  -  which  also  owned  the  legendary  Hacienda  club  in  Manchester  -  was  told  in  the  Michael  Winterbottom  film  24  Hour  Party  People,  in  which  Wilson  was  played  by  Steve  Coogan.  |||    Wilson  stressed  that  the  independent  music  scene  remained  ""as  important""  as  it  had  been  during  the  1980s,  when  labels  such  as  Factory  and  Rough  Trade  proliferated.  He  pointed  out  that  Franz  Ferdinand  and  The  White  Stripes  -  ""perhaps  the  two  most  important  bands  since  the  millennium""  -  were  signed  to  indies.  ""I  think  that  is  a  reflection  of  how  useful  and  how  powerful  the  indie  philosophy  is,  and  how  bands  prefer  it,""  he  added.  ""They  can  make  more  money  that  way  -  it's  a  more  generous  relationship,  and  also  it's  a  more  understanding  relationship.  ""I  think  independents  are  in  a  wonderful  position  at  this  moment  in  time."" "

2,"Brown  in  appeal  for  Labour  unity  |||    Gordon  Brown  has  made  an  appeal  for  unity  after  reports  claimed  Mr  Blair  went  back  on  a  pledge  to  stand  down  before  the  next  general  election.  |||    The  chancellor  would  not  comment  on  the  reports,  but  insisted  he  would  not  be  ""diverted  or  distracted""  from  tackling  the  challenges  faced  by  the  country.  His  only  ""motivation""  was  to  ensure  Labour  was  re-elected,  he  insisted.  Mr  Blair  earlier  dismissed  the  claim  he  had  reneged  on  a  promise  to  stand  aside  for  Gordon  Brown  as  old  news.  According  to  a  new  book,  Brown's  Britain  by  Sunday  Telegraph  journalist  Robert  Peston,  Mr  Blair  went  back  on  a  pledge  to  make  way  for  Mr  Brown  after  Cabinet  allies  intervened  in  June  2004.  |||    In  an  interview  with  BBC  One's  Breakfast  with  Frost,  Mr  Blair  said:  ""I've  dealt  with  this  six  months  ago.  I  said  then  you  don't  do  deals  over  jobs  like  this  -  you  don't.  ""What  both  of  us  are  actually  concentrating  on  are  the  issues  that  concern  the  country.""  |||    In  a  separate  interview  with  BBC  political  editor  Andrew  Marr,  Mr  Brown  said:  ""It's  very  important  that  we  all  do  what  we  can  in  a  unified  way  to  ensure  the  election  of  a  Labour  government.  ""I  think  it  is  very  important  to  stress  that  that  is  the  motivation  that  I  have.  ""That  is  my  purpose  in  politics,  and  that  is  what  every  day  I  seek  to  do.  And  I  am  not  going  to  be  diverted  or  distracted,  nor  is  Tony  Blair,  by  newspaper  stories  or  books  or  rumours  or  gossip.  ""The  only  reason  why  we  are  in  government  is  to  get  on  with  the  job  in  a  unified  way  to  deal  with  the  challenges  facing  this  country.""  Mr  Brown  also  said  he  had  discussed  the  general  election  campaign  with  the  prime  minister  on  Saturday  and  pledged  to  play  his  part  as  he  had  been  asked  to  do.  |||    But  Mr  Peston  said  the  pair  had  ""mutual  animosity  and  contempt""  for  each  other  and  that  Mr  Blair  had  decided  in  November  2003  he  would  quit  because  he  felt  he  had  lost  voters'  trust  because  of  the  Iraq  war.  He  then  changed  his  mind  in  June  2004,  following  intervention  from  allies  in  the  Cabinet  and  the  suspicion  that  the  chancellor  was  deliberately  manoeuvring  against  him,  according  to  the  book.  Andrew  Marr  said:  ""This  is  enormously  damaging.  Gordon  Brown  knows  it  as  well  as  Tony  Blair.  ""I  think  the  relationship  is  genuinely,  privately,  very  poor  indeed.  Things  are  very  difficult.""  He  added:  ""Lots  of  ministers  believe  Tony  Blair  will  attempt  to  move  Gordon  Brown  out  of  the  Treasury  after  the  election.  ""That  depends  on  whether  there's  still  a  Labour  government  and  their  majority.""  |||    Senior  MPs  are  expected  to  raise  concerns  about  the  latest  reports  of  infighting  at  the  regular  meeting  of  Labour  backbenchers  on  Monday.  |||    Health  Secretary  John  Reid  said  those  fuelling  such  reports  were  damaging  Labour's  re-election  chances  and  would  not  be  easily  forgiven.  Fresh  speculation  of  a  rift  recently  followed  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown's  separate  responses  to  the  Asian  tsunami.  These  rumours  were  fuelled  by  Mr  Blair's  decision  to  hold  his  monthly  media  conference  at  the  same  time  as  a  long-planned  speech  by  Mr  Brown  on  UK  plans  to  tackle  global  poverty  with  a  new  ""Marshall  Plan""  for  Africa.  There  was  speculation  the  pair  were  trying  to  outdo  each  other's  response  to  the  disaster.  But  the  prime  minister  said  he  had  discussed  these  claims  with  the  chancellor  and  dismissed  them  as  a  ""load  of  nonsense"".  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  accused  the  prime  minister  and  Mr  Brown  of""squabbling  like  schoolboys"".  Liberal  Democrat  parliamentary  chairman  Matthew  Taylor  said  the  personal  ambition  of  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  was  ""getting  in  the  way  of  good  government"". "

1,"DVD  review:  Spider-Man  2  |||    It's  a  universal  rule  that  a  film  can  either  be  a  superhero  special  effects  extravaganza  or  it  can  be  good.  But  Spider-Man  2  breaks  that  rule  in  two.  |||    It's  not  fantastically  deep  but  you  get  quickly  drawn  into  the  tale  of  Spidey  versus  Doc  Ock  and  more  so  into  the  fate  of  poor  Peter  Parker.  Gigantic  action  set  pieces  seamlessly  work  with  more  brooding  personal  torment  and  it  all  looks  stunning.  A  few  effects  look  false  but  Tobey  Maguire,  Kirsten  Dunst  and  Alfred  Molina  make  this  compelling.  The  other  universal  rule  is  that  DVDs  of  superhero  films  will  have  Making  Of  features  only  about  the  effects.  This  disc  covers  those  special  effects  enough  but  as  just  one  part  of  a  detailed  look  at  the  film.  Then  there  are  commentaries,  trailers  and  a  blooper  reel.  |||    Sometimes  quality  comes  in  bulk:  this  set  contains  no  less  than  34  John  Wayne  films  ranging  from  the  Westerns  and  war  movies  to  The  Quiet  Man.  |||    Now  is  that  a  Christmas  present  or  what?  Give  this  to  someone  on  24  December  and  you  won't  see  them  again  until  early  in  the  New  Year.  It's  not  truly  a  complete  collection  and  leans  more  toward  Wayne's  earlier  films:  there's  no  True  Grit,  for  instance,  though  there  is  Hellraisers.  The  films  look  well  transferred  to  DVD,  though  none  has  extras.  |||    It  was  very  daft  but  it  knew  it  was  and  somehow  this  famous  1979  series  became  a  cult  favourite  that's  been  long  awaited  on  DVD.  This  set  has  the  first  season  of  Buck  (Gil  Gerard)  and  Wilma's  (Erin  Gray)  tongue-in-cheek  adventures  and  it's  all  as  camp  and  gaudy  as  you  remember.  But  it's  also  a  disappointment.  The  US  DVD  has  this  and  the  more  po-faced  second  season  -  and  you  can  import  it  for  just  about  the  same  price.  The  bigger  omission,  though,  is  that  there  are  no  extras.  That's  particularly  disappointing  because  originally  there  were  meant  to  be  commentaries  and  stars  Gerard  and  Gray  had  agreed  to  do  them. "

0,"Bank  payout  to  Pinochet  victims  |||    A  US  bank  has  said  it  will  donate  more  than  $8m  to  victims  of  former  Chilean  military  ruler  Augusto  Pinochet's  regime  under  a  Madrid  court  settlement.  |||    Riggs  Bank  will  put  money  in  a  special  fund  to  be  managed  by  a  Madrid-based  charity,  the  Salvador  Allende  Foundation,  which  helps  abused  victims.  The  bank  had  been  accused  of  illegally  concealing  Gen  Pinochet's  assets.  More  than  3,000  people  were  killed  for  political  reasons  under  Gen  Pinochet's  regime,  an  official  report  says.  Last  month  in  a  US  court,  Riggs  Bank  pleaded  guilty  to  failing  to  report  suspicious  activity  relating  to  accounts  held  by  Gen  Pinochet  and  the  government  of  Equatorial  Guinea.  On  that  occasion,  it  was  ordered  to  pay  a  fine  of  $16m.  Gen  Pinochet  himself  has  never  been  put  on  trial  for  human  rights  violations  under  his  1973-90  rule,  despite  several  high-profile  cases  against  him.  He  is  now  facing  charges  relating  to  the  murder  of  one  Chilean  and  the  disappearance  of  nine  others.  He  is  also  being  investigated  for  tax  evasion,  tax  fraud  and  embezzlement  of  state  funds.  |||    The  general's  opponents  rejoiced  at  the  settlement,  which  was  agreed  in  a  court  in  the  Spanish  capital,  Madrid.  A  lawyer  for  the  victims,  Eduardo  Contreras,  told  Reuters  news  agency:  ""This  demonstrates  that  the  horrors  of  the  Pinochet  dictatorship  are  not  a  mystery  to  anyone  and  that  the  whole  world  knows  his  victims  deserve  reparations.""  Riggs  spokesman  Mark  Hendrix  said  the  settlement,  details  of  which  will  be  announced  next  week,  was  an  opportunity  to  move  on.  ""This  enables  the  institution  to  put  the  matter  behind  us,""  he  told  Reuters.  The  settlement  follows  a  legal  complaint  filed  against  the  bank  by  Spanish  Judge  Baltasar  Garzon  alleging  that  it  had  illegally  concealed  assets.  The  bank  agreed  to  create  a  fund  for  the  victims,  but  the  charges  were  dropped. "

0,"Asia  quake  increases  poverty  risk  |||    Nearly  two  million  people  across  Asia  could  be  thrown  into  poverty  because  of  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  said.  |||    In  its  first  overview  of  the  disaster,  the  ADB  said  the  impact  on  economic  growth  would  be  slight  because  major  cities  and  factories  escaped  damage.  But  the  blow  to  many  low-income  people  could  be  ""enormous"".  The  Paris  Club  of  rich  creditor  nations  on  Wednesday  offered  to  freeze  debts  owed  by  tsunami-hit  countries.  |||    The  move  was  aimed  at  helping  South  Asian  governments  find  budgets  to  rebuild  devastated  coastal  areas,  though  so  far  only  Sri  Lanka,  Indonesia  and  the  Seychelles  have  indicated  that  they  will  take  it  up.  |||    Other  countries  believe  their  economies  are  strong  enough  to  cope  or  wish  to  avoid  being  viewed  as  credit  risks.  ""Poverty  is  potentially  the  most  important  impact  of  this  natural  disaster,""  said  ADB  chief  economist  Ifzal  Ali.  Donor  nations  have  promised  to  give  $717m  (£379m)  in  disaster  relief  over  the  next  six  months,  according  to  the  United  Nations.  |||    Mr  Ali  added  his  voice  to  those  warning  that  aid  pledges  must  be  promptly  delivered,  saying  the  number  of  people  at  risk  of  poverty  hinged  on  ""concerns  over  sanitation  and  health  conditions,  and  other  basic  needs""  being  ""properly  and  quickly  addressed"".  |||    There  are  1.9  billion  people  in  Asia  living  on  less  than  $2  a  day.  The  ADB  fears  that  1  million  Indonesians  could  join  them,  while  in  India  just  over  half  a  million  people  -  645,000  -  are  at  risk  of  falling  into  poverty.  A  quarter  of  a  million  Sri  Lankans  and  23,500  people  in  the  Maldives  are  also  facing  poverty.  In  the  Maldives,  where  43%  of  the  population  already  lives  on  less  than  $2  a  day,  this  could  rise  to  half.  Sri  Lanka  and  the  Maldives  are  the  two  countries  the  ADB  fears  are  most  at  risk  of  suffering  lasting  economic  damage  from  the  tsunami.  Sri  Lanka's  government  has  estimated  reconstruction  costs  at  nearly  $3bn.  A  government  task  force  held  meetings  to  discuss  an  emergency  rebuilding  plan  with  the  ADB,  World  Bank  and  Japanese  aid  agencies  on  Wednesday,  and  promised  to  publish  the  plan  within  10  days.  |||    Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Thailand  and  India  have  enjoyed  strong  economic  growth  in  recent  years,  which  should  cushion  them  against  reconstruction  costs.  Although  Indonesia's  northern  province  of  Aceh  suffered  the  worst  death  toll,  the  region's  oil  and  natural  gas  production  facilities  ""have  survived  intact"",  the  report  said.  However,  it  remains  too  soon  to  asses  the  damage  to  poor  people's  livelihoods  in  Aceh  because  it  would  depend  on  how  much  farm  land  had  been  flooded  by  seawater.  ""This  is  a  profoundly  tragic  event  for  the  region  and  for  the  millions  who  are  suffering.  But  the  economies  of  the  affected  countries  except  Sri  Lanka  and  the  Maldives  should  emerge  with  minimal  damage,""  the  ADB  report  said.  Some  businesses  may  even  gain  from  the  reconstruction  efforts,  thereby  creating  jobs.  At  a  meeting  in  Thailand,  ABD  president  Thadao  Chino  said  he  was  confident  of  the  country's  ""own  capabilities  to  restore  normalcy  to  the  affected  areas  and  meet  the  rehabilitation  requirements"".  Thailand  has  said  it  does  not  wish  to  opt  for  a  debt  repayment  freeze,  while  India  has  also  rejected  international  aid,  saying  it  can  cope  on  its  own  resources.  Debt  repayment  holidays  carry  the  risk  of  credit  ratings  downgrades,  making  it  more  expensive  to  borrow  money  in  future.  Indonesia,  however,  is  pressing  for  greater  help  with  its  debts  than  the  current  freeze  would  bring.  It  is  one  of  the  world's  most  indebted  countries. "

0,"Strong  quarterly  growth  for  Nike  |||    Nike  has  reported  its  best  second-quarter  earnings,  helped  by  strong  demand  for  its  athletic  shoes  and  Converse  sneakers.  |||    The  global  sports  giant  said  it  posted  a  profit  of  $261.9m  (£135.6m),  for  the  three  months  to  30  November,  up  from  $179.1m  in  the  same  period  last  year.  Revenues  increased  11%  to  $3.1bn,  from  $2.8bn  for  the  same  period  in  2003.  Nike,  whose  products  are  endorsed  by  Tiger  Woods  among  other  sports  stars,  said  ""demand  continues  to  grow"".  The  results  came  after  a  strong  first  quarter  of  the  year  for  the  firm  based  in  Beaverton,  Oregon.  |||    Philip  Knight,  chairman  and  chief  executive,  said:  ""Nike's  second-quarter  revenues  and  earnings  per  share  reached  all-time  high  levels  as  a  result  of  solid  performance  across  our  global  portfolio.  ""Our  businesses  in  the  United  States  and  emerging  markets  such  as  China,  Russia  and  Turkey,  combined  with  favourable  European  exchange  rates,  helped  drive  much  of  this  growth.""  He  added:  ""With  the  first  half  of  our  fiscal  year  in  the  books,  we  remain  confident  that  our  business  strategy  and  consistent  execution  will  allow  us  to  deliver  on  our  goals  of  healthy,  profitable  growth.""  The  firm  reported  worldwide  futures  orders  for  athletic  footwear  and  gear,  scheduled  for  delivery  from  December  2004  to  April  2005,  of  $4.9bn.  That  is  9.1%  higher  than  such  orders  reported  for  the  same  period  last  year. "

2,"Brown  outlines  third  term  vision  |||    Gordon  Brown  has  outlined  what  he  thinks  should  be  the  key  themes  of  New  Labour's  next  general  election  bid.  |||    He  said  ensuring  every  child  in  Britain  had  the  best  start  in  life  could  be  a  legacy  to  match  the  NHS's  creation.  The  chancellor  has  previously  planned  the  party's  election  strategy  but  this  time  the  role  will  be  filled  by  Alan  Milburn  -  a  key  ally  of  Tony  Blair.  The  premier  insisted  Mr  Brown  will  have  a  key  role  in  Labour's  campaign,  and  praised  his  handling  of  the  economy.  |||    Writing  in  the  Guardian  newspaper,  Mr  Brown  outlined  his  view  of  the  direction  New  Labour  should  be  taking.  ""As  our  manifesto  and  our  programme  for  the  coming  decade  should  make  clear,  Labour's  ambition  is  not  simply  tackling  idleness  but  delivering  full  employment;  not  just  attacking  ignorance,  disease  and  squalor  but  promoting  lifelong  education,  good  health  and  sustainable  communities.""  BBC  political  editor  Andrew  Marr  said  that  Mr  Brown's  article  was  ""a  warning  shot""  to  Mr  Blair  not  to  try  and  cut  him  out  of  the  manifesto  writing  process.  ""It  was,  as  always,  coded  and  careful...  but  entirely  deliberate,""  was  Mr  Marr's  assessment.  The  prime  minister  was  asked  about  Mr  Brown's  article  and  about  his  election  role  when  he  appeared  on  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  Mr  Blair  said  a  decision  had  yet  to  be  taken  over  how  the  election  would  be  run  but  the  chancellor's  role  would  be  ""central"".  Mr  Blair  argued  that  under  New  Labour  the  country  had  changed  for  the  better  and  that  was  ""in  part""  because  of  Mr  Brown's  management  of  the  economy.  And  he  pledged  childcare  would  be  a  ""centrepiece""  of  Labour's  manifesto.  He  also  predicted  the  next  general  election  will  be  a  ""tough,  tough  fight""  for  New  Labour.  But  the  prime  minister  insisted  he  did  not  know  what  date  the  poll  would  take  place  despite  speculation  about  5  May.  Mr  Blair  said  he  was  taking  ""nothing  for  granted""  ahead  of  the  vote  -  warning  that  the  Tory  strategy  was  to  win  power  via  the  back  door  by  hinting  they  were  aiming  to  cut  Labour's  majority  instead  of  hoping  for  an  outright  win.

1,"A-listers  flock  to  Gervais  sitcom  |||    Hollywood  actors  Samuel  L  Jackson  and  Ben  Stiller  have  signed  up  for  Ricky  Gervais'  new  sitcom,  the  comedian  has  told  BBC  News.  |||    He  said  they  had  both  seen  the  scripts  and  had  agreed  to  appear  in  an  episode  each  of  the  sitcom  Extras.  They  join  British  stars  Jude  Law  and  Kate  Winslet  who  have  been  booked  for  guest  roles.  The  comic  and  actor  said  he  had  drawn  up  an  A-list  of  stars  he  wanted  and  all  had  agreed  to  be  in  it.  ""We  wanted  actors  who  had  iconic  status  but  that  we  could  also  deconstruct,""  Gervais  told  BBC  News.  |||    ""It's  not  about  the  zeitgeist.  We  wanted  people  who  would  still  be  around  in  20  years,  not  just  the  winner  of  Big  Brother  to  take  part.""  Gervais  admitted  he  was  cautious  about  revealing  who  would  be  taking  part  until  they  had  all  signed  on  the  dotted  line.  But  he  has  met  with  Stiller  and  Jackson  and  they  enjoyed  the  scripts  enough  to  commit  to  it.  |||    ""I  didn't  want  to  start  revealing  names  until  it  was  all  sorted  because  people  just  mention  people  who  haven't  even  been  asked.  ""I  have  been  linked  with  ridiculous  stories  recently  such  as  I'm  going  to  be  in  a  remake  of  10  taking  Dudley  Moore's  part.  I  haven't  been  approached  and  I  wouldn't  take  it  anyway.""  |||    He  said  Stiller  and  Jackson  would  be  playing  ""twisted""  versions  of  themselves  in  Extras  and  that  the  jokes  about  them  ""would  sail  pretty  close  to  the  bone"".  Gervais  and  his  writing  partner  Stephen  Merchant  are  currently  refining  the  scripts  for  the  six-part  series,  in  which  Gervais  plays  a  struggling  actor  who  bitches  about  the  stars.  Meanwhile,  Gervais  is  gearing  up  to  promote  his  cartoon  book  Flanimals  which  is  released  in  the  US  in  March,  around  the  same  time  as  NBC  begin  showing  the  US  version  of  The  Office.  The  film  rights  to  Flanimals  have  already  been  snapped  up  but  Gervais  is  keen  for  the  project  to  be  taken  slowly.  ""A  film  will  happen  over  the  next  three  years  but  I  don't  want  it  to  be  a  $50m  movie  straight  away  because  it  is  not  well  enough  known  and  it  wouldn't  be  another  Spider-Man  or  Batman.  I  would  like  to  do  something  small  on  TV  with  it  first."" "

0,"Lloyd's  of  London  head  chides  FSA  |||    The  head  of  Lloyd's  of  London,  the  insurance  market,  has  criticised  Britain's  financial  watchdog,  the  Financial  Services  Authority  (FSA).  |||    In  a  speech  on  Monday,  Mr  Prettejohn  urged  the  FSA  to  force  brokers  to  disclose  the  size  of  their  commissions.  ""The  FSA  should  change,  and  change  now""  said  Mr  Prettejohn,  who  wants  it  to  move  from  ""disclosure  on  request""  to  mandatory  disclosure.  The  call  came  in  a  speech  on  improving  the  London  insurance  market.  |||    ""The  FSA  should  not  bide  their  time  and  'wait  and  see'.  They  should  seize  the  moment,""  Mr  Prettejohn,  Lloyd's  chief  executive  said.  The  FSA  took  over  regulation  of  the  general  insurance  sector  in  January,  but  it  sidestepped  calls  to  require  brokers  to  disclose  the  commissions  they  earn  from  insurers  to  their  clients.  Last  week,  the  City  watchdog  gave  brokers  and  insurers  guidance  on  managing  conflicts  of  interest.  Brokers  must  give  information  on  their  commissions  if,  and  only  if,  their  customers  request  it,  the  FSA  said.  |||    In  the  US,  lack  of  transparency  about  brokers'  commissions  has  led  to  problems.  The  world's  biggest  insurance  broker  Marsh  &  McLennan  said  last  week  it  would  pay  $850m  to  settle  charges,  raised  by  New  York  Attorney  General  Eliot  Spitzer  in  October,  that  it  sought  to  rig  bids  in  conjunction  with  insurers.  The  probe  centred  around  so-called  contingent  commissions,  whereby  brokers  were  rewarded  according  to  how  much  business  they  brought  to  an  insurer,  an  arrangement  that  did  not  always  benefit  brokers'  customers.  All  of  the  insurance  business  written  in  the  Lloyd's  market  is  placed  via  brokers. "

2,"Parties'  plans  for  council  tax  |||    Anger  at  council  tax  rises  spilled  over  into  mass  protests  in  2003,  when  the  average  English  bill  rose  12.9%.  |||    Pensioners'  protests  spread  -  some  marched,  others  simply  refused  to  pay  the  increase.  Some,  such  as  83-year-old  Elizabeth  Winkfield,  said  they  would  rather  go  to  jail.  The  Audit  Commission  found  the  whole  local  government  finance  system  was  ""fundamentally  flawed""  and  all  three  of  the  main  parties  have  said  the  system  has  to  change.  |||    Labour  says  it  wants  to  retain  the  property-based  tax  but  reform  it  to  make  it  fairer  and  says  there  is  scope  for  councils  to  become  more  efficient.  They  say  they  are  already  helping  pensioners  with  council  tax  bills,  with  a  £100  lump  sum  for  the  over-70s  and  last  year  the  government  capped  some  local  councils'  budgets  to  keep  demands  down.  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  has  said  the  current  system  is  not  sustainable  in  the  long  term  and  said  there  would  be  ""radical  reform"".  The  party  says  this  year's  increases  will  be  the  lowest  in  a  decade.  A  report  last  year  looked  at  increasing  the  number  of  council  tax  bands  and  other  forms  of  local  taxation,  such  as  reformed  business  rates,  although  no  decisions  have  been  made.  An  independent  inquiry  into  its  findings,  the  Lyons  review,  is  due  to  report  back  at  the  end  of  2005.  |||    The  Tories  have  promised  a  reduction  on  bills  for  pensioners,  who  they  say  have  been  hardest  hit  by  year-on-year  increases  in  council  tax.  They  say  they  can  save  £4bn  on  ""government  waste"",  of  which  £1.3bn  could  be  used  to  cut  pensioners'  bills  by  an  average  of  £340.  It  would  not  be  means  tested,  say  the  Tories,  because  that  would  create  more  bureaucracy  and  could  discourage  people  from  saving  for  their  retirement.  Instead  households  where  council  tax  payers  are  over  65  would  get  a  rebate  covering  half  their  bill,  up  to  a  maximum  of  £500.  The  Tories  also  say  they  are  suspicious  about  any  proposals  to  revalue  homes  -  currently  graded  according  to  their  value  in  1991  -  because  they  believe  seven  million  of  homes  could  move  up  a  band.  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats  want  to  do  away  with  the  council  tax  altogether  and  switch  to  a  local  income  tax  of  the  kind  seen  in  the  USA,  Norway  and  Switzerland.  The  rate  would  be  set  locally,  but  administered  by  the  Inland  Revenue  which  they  say  would  save  at  least  £300m.  They  say  the  council  tax  is  the  most  unpopular  and  most  unfair  tax  in  Britain,  because  it  puts  a  ""ceiling""  on  what  the  richest  pay.  The  party  says  it  would  aim  for  a  £5,000  tax-free  personal  allowance,  or  a  £7,000  allowance  for  the  over-65s.  After  that  income  would  be  taxed  up  to  £100,000.  The  Lib  Dems  say  their  plan  is  fairer,  more  efficient,  has  already  been  tested  abroad  and  offers  more  accountability. "

2,"End  Bush  'denial'  Blair  tells  EU  |||    Tony  Blair  is  urging  European  leaders  to  wake  up  from  their  ""state  of  denial""  over  President  Bush's  re-election.  |||    ""America  has  spoken.  The  rest  of  the  world  should  listen,""  the  prime  minister  said  in  an  interview  with  The  Times  newspaper,  published  on  Friday.  Mr  Blair  is  at  a  summit  in  Brussels,  where  Iraq  and  European  justice  and  immigration  plans  are  on  the  agenda.  French  President  Jacques  Chirac  reacted  to  his  warning  by  saying  Europe  instead  needed  to  reinforce  its  own  unity.  Mr  Blair  has  probably  been  closer  to  President  Bush  than  any  other  European  leader.  |||    He  said  some  people  were  in  ""a  sort  of  state  of  denial""  about  the  US  election  result  but  predicted  a  more  ""receptive  mood""  would  emerge  soon.  America  needed  to  listen  to  the  world  too,  he  said.  ""The  fact  is  that  President  Bush  is  there  for  four  years.  He  is  there  because  the  American  people  have  chosen  him,""  he  argued.  He  also  made  clear  he  intended  to  take  seriously  what  he  perceives  as  his  role  in  bringing  the  two  continents  together.  |||    Britain  was  ""uniquely  placed""  to  make  out  the  common  ground  because  of  its  strong  alliance  with  the  US,  he  suggested.  He  admitted  he  had  gone  to  bed  at  2230GMT,  well  before  the  American  polls  closed,  thinking  Mr  Kerry  might  have  won.  He  woke  up  at  0530GMT  to  discover  Mr  Bush  had  won  but  declined  to  say  if  he  was  pleased  with  the  eventual  result.  His  words  about  President  Bush  met  a  cool  reception  from  Jacques  Chirac.  The  French  president  told  reporters:  ""Europe  today  has  more  than  ever  the  need,  the  necessity,  to  reinforce  itself  and  its  dynamism  and  unity.  ""That  is  the  goal  of  the  constitution  in  a  world  that  is  more  multi-polar  than  ever.""  |||    Mr  Chirac  will  miss  an  address  to  the  summit  from  Iraqi  interim  leader  Iyad  Allawi,  who  this  week  criticised  nations  which  took  a  ""spectator""  role  to  Iraq's  reconstruction.  Mr  Chirac  denied  there  was  any  snub  -  he  is  going  to  a  memorial  service  for  the  United  Arab  Emirates'  late  leader  and  says  he  would  be  happy  to  meet  Mr  Allawi.  He  also  signed  a  communiqu&#233;  stressing  the  EU's  commitment  to  securing  a  stable  and  unified  Iraq.  The  EU  also  confirmed  a  new  $21m  aid  package.  The  communiqu&#233;  congratulated  President  Bush  on  his  victory  and  stressed  the  importance  of  good  transatlantic  relations.  The  summit  is  also  expected  to  agree  changes  to  streamline  European  asylum  and  immigration  decisions.  Mr  Blair  recently  said  the  UK  would  only  participate  in  EU-wide  measures  where  it  was  in  UK  interests  but  the  Tories  say  he  is  surrendering  a  key  veto.  The  meeting  will  also  assess  progress  on  the  economic  reform  plans  agreed  in  Lisbon  in  2000  to  make  Europe  more  competitive. "

2,"Visa  decision  'every  11  minutes'  |||    Visa  processing  staff  are  sometimes  expected  to  rule  on  an  application  every  11  minutes,  MPs  have  said.  |||    Pressure  was  placed  on  staff  to  be  efficient,  rather  than  to  do  a  thorough  examination  of  an  application,  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  found.  Every  officer  had  an  annual  target  of  8,000  applications  -  equivalent  to  40  a  day  or  one  every  11  minutes.  MPs  want  research  into  whether  UK  visa  holders  leave  at  the  end  of  their  stays,  or  vanish  into  the  black  market.  Committee  chairman  Edward  Leigh  said:  ""There  is  a  worrying  tension  between  quick  processing  and  proper  control  over  the  visas  issued.  ""Entry  clearance  staff  are  expected  to  deal  with  a  visa  application  in  about  11  minutes  which  is  surely  too  little  time  to  look  closely  at  the  supporting  documents.  ""  |||    The  committee's  report  also  discussed  the  Romanian  and  Bulgarian  visas  scandal  which  led  to  the  resignation  of  immigration  minister  Beverley  Hughes  last  year.  Committee  members  said  the  Home  Office  had  been  wrong  to  dismiss  concerns  from  visa  staff  abroad  who  feared  the  system  was  being  abused.  Investigations  carried  out  in  the  wake  of  Ms  Hughes'  resignation  found  more  than  7,000  people  had  entered  the  UK  under  the  business  visa  scheme  for  Romanian  and  Bulgarian  ""entrepreneurs"".  Mr  Leigh  said  the  Home  Office  should  now  consider  removing  those  who  had  not  set  up  a  valid  business.  A  Home  Office  spokesman  said  the  system  had  been  toughened  and  tightened  since  the  investigation.  He  added  ""that  the  traditional  system  of  a  dual  decision  making  process  for  all  pre-entry  applications  will  be  replaced  by  a  single  pre-entry  check  at  post,  which  will  be  simpler  and  more  robust  against  abuse  than  the  current  system"".

0,"Fed  warns  of  more  US  rate  rises  |||    The  US  looks  set  for  a  continued  boost  to  interest  rates  in  2005,  according  to  the  Federal  Reserve.  |||    Minutes  of  the  December  meeting  which  pushed  rates  up  to  2.25%  showed  that  policy-makers  at  the  Fed  are  worried  about  accelerating  inflation.  The  clear  signal  pushed  the  dollar  up  to  $1.3270  to  the  euro  by  0400  GMT  on  Wednesday,  but  depressed  US  shares.  ""The  markets  are  starting  to  fear  a  more  aggressive  Fed  in  2005,""  said  Richard  Yamarone  of  Argus  Research.  The  Dow  Jones  index  dropped  almost  100  points  on  Tuesday,  with  the  Nasdaq  also  falling  as  key  tech  stocks  were  hit  by  broker  downgrades.  The  dollar  also  gained  ground  against  sterling  on  Tuesday,  reaching  $1.8832  to  the  pound  before  slipping  slightly  on  Wednesday  morning.  |||    The  release  of  the  minutes  just  three  weeks  after  the  14  December  meeting  was  much  faster  than  usual,  indicating  the  Fed  wants  to  keep  markets  more  apprised  of  its  thinking.  This,  too,  is  being  taken  in  some  quarters  as  a  sign  of  aggressive  moves  on  interest  rates  to  come.  The  key  Fed  funds  rate  has  risen  1.25  percentage  points  during  2004  from  the  46-year  low  of  1%  reached  not  long  after  the  9/11  attacks  in  2001.  That  long  trough  ""might  be  contributing  to  signs  of  potentially  excessive  risk-taking  in  financial  markets"",  said  the  Federal  Open  Markets  Committee  (FOMC),  which  sets  interest  rates.  The  odds  now  favour  a  further  boost  to  rates  at  the  next  meeting  in  early  February,  economists  said.  But  the  respite  for  the  dollar,  which  spent  late  2003  being  pushed  lower  against  other  major  currencies  by  worries  about  massive  US  trade  and  budget  deficits,  may  be  short-lived.  ""You  can't  rule  out  a  further  correction...  but  we  don't  think  it's  a  change  in  direction  in  the  dollar,""  said  Jason  Daw  at  Merrill  Lynch.  ""Nothing  fundamental  has  changed."" "

2,"'Super  union'  merger  plan  touted  |||    Two  of  Britain's  big  trade  unions  could  merge  to  form  a  ""super  union""  of  two  million  members.  |||    The  move  by  Amicus  and  the  Transport  and  General  Workers  Union  (TGWU)  would  be  a  seen  as  a  bid  to  carry  more  weight  with  ministers  and  employers.  Amicus  has  1.2  million  members  and  the  TGWU  has  800,000.  Any  merger  would  have  to  be  approved  by  the  unions'  executives  and  their  membership.  It  is  understood  meetings  will  be  held  on  Wednesday  about  the  proposal.  Along  with  the  GMB  and  Unison,  the  TGWU  and  Amicus  worked  closely  together  in  the  last  year  to  hammer  out  a  56-point  deal  with  Labour's  leadership  over  equality  at  work,  holidays  and  pensions  -  the  Warwick  Agreement.  Both  unions  are  remaining  tight-lipped  about  the  merger  rumours,  but  one  insider  pointed  out  to  the  BBC  News  website  that  ""nobody  is  denying  suggestions  a  merger  could  be  on  the  agenda""  when  the  two  unions'  executives  hold  their  meetings  on  Wednesday.  Amicus's  executive  was  due  to  meet  in  any  case  although  the  TGWU  is  holding  specially  scheduled  talks. "

1,"Hillbillies  singer  Scoggins  dies  |||    Country  and  Western  musician  Jerry  Scoggins  has  died  in  Los  Angeles  at  the  age  of  93,  his  family  has  said.  |||    Scoggins  was  best  remembered  for  singing  the  theme  tune  to  popular  US  TV  show  The  Beverly  Hillbillies.  The  Texan-born  singer  approached  the  producers  of  the  programme  with  theme  tune  The  Ballad  of  Jed  Clampett  for  the  pilot  which  was  screened  in  1962.  The  show,  which  told  the  story  of  a  poor  man  striking  oil  and  moving  to  Beverly  Hills,  ran  until  1971.  |||    Scoggins'  daugher  Jane  Kelly  Misel  said  that  her  father  never  tired  of  the  song  and  would  sing  it  at  least  once  a  day.  ""He'd  sing  it  at  birthdays  and  anniversaries  and  variety  shows.  He  never  stopped  performing  it,""  she  said.  When  a  film  version  of  The  Beverly  Hillbillies  was  made  in  1993,  Scoggins  came  out  of  retirement  to  perform  the  theme  tune.  Scoggins  sang  the  lyrics  while  bluegrass  stars  Lester  Flatt  and  Earl  Scruggs  played  guitar  and  banjo. "

3,"Clijsters  hope  on  Aussie  Open  |||    Kim  Clijsters  has  denied  reports  that  she  has  pulled  out  of  January's  Australian  Open  because  of  her  persistent  wrist  injury.  |||    Open  chief  Paul  McNamee  had  said:  ""Kim's  wrist  obviously  isn't  going  to  be  rehabilitated.""  But  her  spokesman  insisted  she  had  simply  delayed  submitting  her  entry.  ""The  doctors  are  assessing  her  injury  on  a  weekly  basis  and  if  there  is  no  risk  she  could  play.  But  if  there's  the  least  risk  she  will  stay  away.""  Despite  being  absent  from  the  WTA  entry  list  for  the  tournament,  which  begins  on  17  January,  Clijsters  would  be  certain  to  get  a  wild  card  if  she  requested  one.  Clijsters  is  still  ranked  22nd  in  the  world  despite  only  playing  a  handful  of  matches  last  season.  The  Belgian  had  an  operation  on  her  left  wrist  early  in  the  season  but  injured  it  again  on  her  return  to  the  tour.  Meanwhile,  Jelena  Dokic,  who  used  to  compete  for  Australia,  has  opted  out  of  the  first  Grand  Slam  of  the  season.  Dokic  has  not  played  in  the  Australian  Open  since  2001  when  she  lost  in  the  first  round.  But  the  21-year-old  would  have  had  to  rely  on  a  wild  card  next  season  because  her  ranking  has  tumbled  to  127th.  Four-time  champion  Monica  Seles,  who  has  not  played  since  last  year's  French  Open,  is  another  absentee  because  of  an  injured  left  foot. "

1,"Aaliyah  claim  dismissed  by  court  |||    Late  R&B  star  Aaliyah's  record  company  has  failed  in  an  attempt  to  sue  the  video  producer  who  booked  the  ill-fated  flight  on  which  she  died  in  2001.  |||    A  New  York  appeals  court  has  told  Blackground  Records  that  only  the  singer's  parents  had  the  right  to  launch  a  claim  for  wrongful  death.  The  22-year-old  singer's  family  came  to  an  undisclosed  settlement  over  a  negligence  claim  in  2003.  Aaliyah  had  completed  a  music  video  when  the  plane  crashed  in  the  Bahamas.  She  and  eight  others  were  killed  on  the  plane,  which  crashed  as  if  left  for  Florida.  Blackground  Records'  lawyer  Frank  Penski  said  he  had  yet  to  examine  the  decision  and  did  not  know  whether  they  would  pursue  the  case.  |||    An  investigation  into  the  crash  revealed  the  twin-engined  Cessna  was  overloaded  by  700  pounds  (320kg).  A  post-mortem  carried  out  on  the  remains  of  the  pilot  showed  there  was  cocaine  and  alcohol  in  his  body.  Aaliyah  was  a  rising  star  in  music  and  film  before  she  was  killed.  She  was  honoured  with  a  string  of  posthumous  awards  and  her  single  More  Than  A  Woman  went  to  number  one  in  the  UK. "

0,"Soaring  oil  'hits  world  economy'  |||    The  soaring  cost  of  oil  has  hit  global  economic  growth,  although  world's  major  economies  should  weather  the  storm  of  price  rises,  according  to  the  OECD.  |||    In  its  latest  bi-annual  report,  the  OECD  cut  its  growth  predictions  for  the  world's  main  industrialised  regions.  US  growth  would  reach  4.4%  in  2004,  but  fall  to  3.3%  next  year  from  a  previous  estimate  of  3.7%,  the  OECD  said.  However,  the  Paris-based  economics  think  tank  said  it  believed  the  global  economy  could  still  regain  momentum.  |||    Forecasts  for  Japanese  growth  were  also  scaled  back  to  4.0%  from  4.4%  this  year  and  2.1%  from  2.8%  in  2005.  But  the  outlook  was  worst  for  the  12-member  eurozone  bloc,  with  already  sluggish  growth  forecasts  slipping  to  1.8%  from  2.0%  this  year  and  1.9%  from  2.4%  in  2005,  the  OECD  said.  Overall,  the  report  forecast  total  growth  of  3.6%  in  2004  for  the  30  member  countries  of  the  OECD,  slipping  to  2.9%  next  year  before  recovering  to  3.1%  in  2006.  ""There  are  nonetheless  good  reasons  to  believe  that  despite  recent  oil  price  turbulence  the  world  economy  will  regain  momentum  in  a  not-too-distant  future,""  said  Jean-Philippe  Cotis,  the  OECD's  chief  economist.  The  price  of  crude  is  about  50%  higher  than  it  was  at  the  start  of  2004,  but  down  on  the  record  high  of  $55.67  set  in  late  October.  |||    A  dip  in  oil  prices  and  improving  jobs  prospects  would  improve  consumer  confidence  and  spending,  the  OECD  said.  ""The  oil  shock  is  not  enormous  by  historical  standards  -  we  have  seen  worse  in  the  seventies.  If  the  oil  price  does  not  rise  any  further,  then  we  think  the  shock  can  be  absorbed  within  the  next  few  quarters,""  Vincent  Koen,  a  senior  economist  with  the  OECD,  told  the  BBC's  World  Business  Report.  ""The  recovery  that  was  underway,  and  has  been  interrupted  a  bit  by  the  oil  shock  this  year,  would  then  regain  momentum  in  the  course  of  2005.""  China's  booming  economy  and  a  ""spectacular  comeback""  in  Japan  -  albeit  one  that  has  faltered  in  recent  months  -  would  help  world  economic  recovery,  the  OECD  said.  ""Supported  by  strong  balance  sheets  and  high  profits,  the  recovery  of  business  investment  should  continue  in  North  America  and  start  in  earnest  in  Europe,""  it  added.  However,  the  report  warned:  ""It  remains  to  be  seen  whether  continental  Europe  will  play  a  strong  supportive  role  through  a  marked  upswing  of  final  domestic  demand.""  The  OECD  highlighted  current  depressed  household  expenditure  in  Germany  and  the  eurozone's  over-reliance  on  export-led  growth. "
