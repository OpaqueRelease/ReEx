2	"Labour  plans  maternity  pay  rise  |||    Maternity  pay  for  new  mothers  is  to  rise  by  £1,400  as  part  of  new  proposals  announced  by  the  Trade  and  Industry  Secretary  Patricia  Hewitt.  |||    It  would  mean  paid  leave  would  be  increased  to  nine  months  by  2007,  Ms  Hewitt  told  GMTV's  Sunday  programme.  Other  plans  include  letting  maternity  pay  be  given  to  fathers  and  extending  rights  to  parents  of  older  children.  The  Tories  dismissed  the  maternity  pay  plan  as  ""desperate"",  while  the  Liberal  Democrats  said  it  was  misdirected.  |||    Ms  Hewitt  said:  ""We  have  already  doubled  the  length  of  maternity  pay,  it  was  13  weeks  when  we  were  elected,  we  have  already  taken  it  up  to  26  weeks.  ""We  are  going  to  extend  the  pay  to  nine  months  by  2007  and  the  aim  is  to  get  it  right  up  to  the  full  12  months  by  the  end  of  the  next  Parliament.""  She  said  new  mothers  were  already  entitled  to  12  months  leave,  but  that  many  women  could  not  take  it  as  only  six  of  those  months  were  paid.  ""We  have  made  a  firm  commitment.  We  will  definitely  extend  the  maternity  pay,  from  the  six  months  where  it  now  is  to  nine  months,  that's  the  extra  £1,400.""  She  said  ministers  would  consult  on  other  proposals  that  could  see  fathers  being  allowed  to  take  some  of  their  partner's  maternity  pay  or  leave  period,  or  extending  the  rights  of  flexible  working  to  carers  or  parents  of  older  children.  The  Shadow  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Family,  Theresa  May,  said:  ""These  plans  were  announced  by  Gordon  Brown  in  his  pre-budget  review  in  December  and  Tony  Blair  is  now  recycling  it  in  his  desperate  bid  to  win  back  women  voters.""  |||    She  said  the  Conservatives  would  announce  their  proposals  closer  to  the  General  Election.  Liberal  Democrat  spokeswoman  for  women  Sandra  Gidley  said:  ""While  mothers  would  welcome  any  extra  maternity  pay  the  Liberal  Democrats  feel  this  money  is  being  misdirected.""  She  said  her  party  would  boost  maternity  pay  in  the  first  six  months  to  allow  more  women  to  stay  at  home  in  that  time.  |||    Ms  Hewitt  also  stressed  the  plans  would  be  paid  for  by  taxpayers,  not  employers.  But  David  Frost,  director  general  of  the  British  Chambers  of  Commerce,  warned  that  many  small  firms  could  be  ""crippled""  by  the  move.  ""While  the  majority  of  any  salary  costs  may  be  covered  by  the  government's  statutory  pay,  recruitment  costs,  advertising  costs,  retraining  costs  and  the  strain  on  the  company  will  not  be,""  he  said.  Further  details  of  the  government's  plans  will  be  outlined  on  Monday.  New  mothers  are  currently  entitled  to  90%  of  average  earnings  for  the  first  six  weeks  after  giving  birth,  followed  by  £102.80  a  week  until  the  baby  is  six  months  old."

Economic  growth  slowed  in  the  previous  quarter,  as  manufacturing  output  fell,  while  consumer  confidence  has  slipped.  There  is  also  growing  evidence  that  the  previously  booming  UK  housing  market  is  now  cooling.  |||    House  prices  fell  0.4%  in  October,  according  to  the  Nationwide,  their  biggest  monthly  fall  since  February  2001.  Last  month,  Bank  of  England  governor  Mervyn  King  said  that  the  economy  had  hit  a  ""softer  patch""  after  rapid  economic  growth  in  the  first  half  of  2004.  Richard  Jeffrey,  chief  economist  at  Bridgewell  Securities,  said  it  was  very  unlikely  that  the  Bank  of  England  would  put  rates  up  again  this  time  around.  ""There  have  been  sufficient  signs  in  the  economy  of  a  slowdown  to  stay  the  Bank  of  England's  hand,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  However,  Mr  Jeffrey  said  he  believed  the  slowdown  in  economic  activity  was  temporary  and  it  was  dangerous  to  assume  that  rates  had  peaked.  ""I  still  think  interest  rates  are  going  up,""  he  said.  ""We  are  not  out  of  the  woods.""" 

2	"Defiant  hunts  put  ban  to  the  test  |||    Thousands  of  hunt  supporters  have  been  out  on  the  first  day  of  hunting  in  England  and  Wales  after  the  ban  on  hunting  with  dogs  came  into  force.  |||    The  Countryside  Alliance  called  on  hunt  supporters  to  meet  as  normal,  but  vowed  to  stay  within  the  law.  Although  hunting  with  dogs  is  now  a  criminal  offence,  exercising  hounds,  chasing  a  scent  trail  and  flushing  out  foxes  to  be  shot  are  still  legal.  One  anti-hunt  protester  was  taken  to  hospital  after  a  violent  clash  in  Kent.  |||    The  man  suffered  facial  injuries  after  an  incident  involving  a  group  of  men  at  the  end  of  the  East  Kent  Hunt,  near  Ashford.  In  Wiltshire,  police  arrested  four  men  under  the  new  law  suspected  of  hunting  with  dogs.  The  group,  from  South  Wales  and  Ireland,  have  been  released  on  bail  but  police  say  they  may  face  prosecution  under  new  poaching  laws.  |||    It  is  believed  more  than  270  hunts  went  out  on  Saturday,  just  one  day  after  the  ban  came  in.  |||    They  were  greeted  by  big  crowds  in  many  areas  of  the  country,  with  actor  Jeremy  Irons  and  former  minister  Kate  Hoey  among  the  supporters.  Anti-hunt  groups  -  such  as  the  League  Against  Cruel  Sports  -  deployed  100  monitors  at  hunts  to  check  for  illegal  activity.  |||    Mike  Hobday,  from  the  league,  said  video  evidence  of  the  law  being  broken  was  to  be  passed  onto  police.  ""Our  evidence  suggests  that  most  hunts  did  operate  within  the  law,  many  meeting  and  promptly  going  home  and  others  peacefully  exercising  their  hounds  or  drag  hunting.  ""However,  we  have  received  reports  of  what  we  believe  is  clearly  illegal  activity  by  a  number  of  hunts  across  Britain.""  BBC  correspondent  Simon  Hall  at  Postbridge  on  Dartmoor  in  the  West  Country  said  2,000  people  had  turned  out  to  welcome  the  hunt.  |||    And  the  BBC's  Sarah  Mukherjee,  with  the  Beaufort  Hunt  in  Badminton,  Gloucestershire  said  several  hundred  people  had  gathered  on  foot  to  see  the  hunt,  with  150  on  horseback.  Tom  Heap,  BBC  rural  affairs  correspondent,  said  it  appeared  that  hunstman  had,  for  now,  been  sticking  to  the  new  rules.  And  while  there  was  big  turnout  in  support  of  the  hunts  on  Saturday,  he  said  it  remains  to  be  seen  if  the  level  of  backing  can  be  maintained.  |||    Before  riding  out  with  the  hunt,  former  minister  Kate  Hoey  told  crowds:  ""We  will  prevail  and  this  law  will  have  to  be  overturned.""  Judith  Moritz,  in  Melton  Mowbray,  said  anti-hunt  activists  were  out  to  monitor  the  four  hunts  operating  in  that  part  of  Leicestershire,  but  were  outnumbered  by  large  crowds  of  followers.  The  Countryside  Alliance  said  the  meets  would  show  the  new  law  was  ""impossibly  difficult  to  determine""  and  open  to  different  interpretations.  |||    Chief  executive  Simon  Hart  said:  ""There  has  been  hunting  in  England  for  700  years.  This  [ban]  may  take  two  or  three  years,  perhaps  two  or  three  months,  to  unpick.  ""It  will  be  nothing  more  than  a  temporary  break  in  normal  service,  as  broadcasters  say.""  Conservative  family  spokeswoman  Theresa  May  said  if  the  party  was  in  government  again  it  would  make  sure  the  law  was  repealed.  Suffolk  Chief  Constable  Alastair  McWhirter,  the  Association  of  Chief  Police  Officers'  spokesman  on  rural  policing,  told  the  BBC  the  law  would  be  enforced,  although  the  police  would  not  break  up  hunts.  The  Attorney  General  Lord  Goldsmith  has  so  far  not  issued  any  instructions  to  police  on  how  they  should  deal  with  any  hunters  who  do  violate  the  law.  He  said  he  would  consult  the  director  of  public  prosecutions  and  the  police  ""in  the  near  future""  to  decide  what  measures  to  take  on  hunting  prosecutions." 

1	"Connick  Jr  to  lead  Broadway  show  |||    Singer  and  actor  Harry  Connick  Jr  is  to  star  in  a  Broadway  revival  of  1950s  hit  musical  The  Pajama  Game.  |||    He  will  play  the  supervisor  of  a  US  pyjama  factory  who  has  a  romance  with  a  union  activist  during  labour  unrest.  Jeffrey  Richards,  the  show's  co-producer,  said  Connick  was  ""an  actor  of  enormous  charisma  and  skill,  a  wonderful  singer  and  a  bona  fide  star"".  He  has  recently  starred  in  hit  US  comedy  Will  and  Grace  as  the  husband  of  Grace,  played  by  Debra  Messing.  The  musical  will  open  in  November,  said  Mr  Richards,  who  added  that  no  other  casting  had  been  announced  yet.  |||    The  original  book  by  George  Abbott  and  Richard  Bissell  will  be  revised  by  playwright  Peter  Ackerman,  who  co-wrote  the  screenplay  for  the  movie  Ice  Age.  It  has  a  score  by  Richard  Adler  and  Jerry  Ross,  and  Adler  is  writing  two  new  songs  for  the  score,  which  includes  numbers  including  Hey  There,  Small  Talk  and  Steam  Heat.  Connick  appeared  with  his  band  on  Broadway  in  1990,  and  he  wrote  the  score  for  a  musical  based  on  Emile  Zola's  novel  Therese  Raquin,  called  Thou  Shalt  Not.  It  had  a  three-month  run  on  Broadway  in  2001."

South  Korea,  which  has  about  $200bn  in  foreign  reserves,  said  it  plans  instead  to  boost  holdings  of  currencies  such  as  the  Australian  and  Canadian  dollar.  Analysts  reckon  that  other  nations  may  follow  suit  and  now  ditch  the  dollar.  At  1300  GMT,  the  euro  was  up  0.9%  on  the  day  at  1.3187  euros  per  US  dollar.  The  British  pound  had  added  0.5%  to  break  through  the  $1.90  level,  while  the  dollar  had  fallen  by  1.3%  against  the  Japanese  yen  to  trade  at  104.16  yen.  |||    At  the  start  of  the  year,  the  US  currency,  which  had  lost  7%  against  the  euro  in  the  final  three  months  of  2004  and  had  fallen  to  record  lows,  staged  something  of  a  recovery.  |||    Analysts,  however,  pointed  to  the  dollar's  inability  recently  to  extend  that  rally  despite  positive  economic  and  corporate  data,  and  highlighted  the  fact  that  many  of  the  US's  economic  problems  had  not  disappeared.  The  focus  once  again  has  been  on  the  country's  massive  trade  and  budget  deficits,  with  predictions  of  more  dollar  weakness  to  come.  ""The  comments  from  Korea  came  at  a  time  when  sentiment  towards  the  dollar  was  already  softening,""  said  Ian  Gunner,  a  trader  at  Mellon  Financial.  On  Tuesday,  traders  in  Asia  said  that  both  South  Korea  and  Taiwan  had  withdrawn  their  bids  to  buy  dollars  at  the  start  of  the  session.  Mansoor  Mohi-Uddin,  chief  currency  strategist  at  UBS,  said  that  there  was  a  sentiment  in  the  market  that  ""central  banks  from  Asia  and  the  Middle  East  are  buying  euros"".  A  report  last  month  already  showed  that  the  dollar  was  losing  its  allure  as  a  currency  that  offered  rock-steady  returns  and  stability.  Compiled  by  Central  Banking  Publications  and  sponsored  by  the  UK's  Royal  Bank  of  Scotland,  the  survey  found  39  nations  out  of  65  questioned  were  increasing  their  euro  holdings,  with  29  cutting  back  on  the  US  dollar." 

2	"EU  referendum  question  unveiled  |||    The  question  to  be  asked  in  the  referendum  on  the  EU  Constitution  has  been  unveiled  by  the  government.  |||    It  will  be:  ""Should  the  United  Kingdom  approve  the  treaty  establishing  a  constitution  for  the  European  Union?""  The  constitution  will  be  incorporated  into  UK  law  if  there  is  a  yes  vote  in  the  referendum,  expected  in  2006.  Critics  say  the  constitution  is  a  further  step  towards  a  federal  Europe,  but  advocates  say  it  ensures  effective  operation  of  the  enlarged  25-state  EU.  ""If  we  reject  this  treaty,  Britain  will  be  isolated  and  weak  in  Europe,""  said  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw,  who  along  with  the  rest  of  the  Cabinet,  will  back  a  ""yes""  vote.  |||    Patriots  by  definition  wanted  the  UK  to  be  prosperous  at  home  and  strong  and  influential  abroad,  Mr  Straw  said.  ""Our  role  as  a  leading  member  of  the  EU  is  a  crucial  part  of  securing  that.""  |||    Conservative  shadow  foreign  secretary  Michael  Ancram  said  the  referendum  question  ""seems  straightforward"".  But  he  accused  the  government  of  trying  to  confuse  the  issue  by  putting  the  EU  referendum  question  in  the  same  bill  as  the  ratification  of  the  constitution,  when  they  should  be  treated  as  ""two  separate  issues"".  Despite  this  ""underhand  trick,""  the  referendum  bill  stood  ""no  chance  of  becoming  law  before  the  election,""  he  added.  ""This  is  Tony  Blair's  cheap  gesture  to  the  pro-constitution  lobby  while  he  runs  scared  of  a  debate  on  Europe  he  knows  he  cannot  win.""  Neil  O'Brien,  director  of  anti-constitution  group  Vote  No,  said:  ""The  reality  is  that  the  government  doesn't  want  to  discuss  the  EU  constitution  ahead  of  the  election  because  they  know  it  is  extremely  unpopular  with  voters  and  with  business.""  |||    The  UK  Independence  Party  said:  ""If  the  government  believes  that  a  No  vote  would  mean  that  we  should  leave  the  European  Union,  they  should  just  ask  us  if  we  want  to  leave  the  EU.  Then  we  can  be  out  of  it  and  better  off  much  sooner.""  |||    Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy,  who  backs  the  constitution,  said  he  expected  the  referendum  would  come  in  the  first  half  of  next  year.  He  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""The  sooner  we  get  on  with  this,  the  better.""  He  said  the  question  sounded  ""very  neutral""  and  ""balanced,""  adding  it  would  enable  the  argument  ""to  be  enjoined  fairly  and  squarely  on  both  sides"".  Green  MEP  Caroline  Lucas  welcomed  Tony  Blair's  ""courage  in  keeping  his  word""  on  holding  a  referendum.  But  she  added:  ""This  treaty  is  a  flawed  document  that  will  make  the  EU  less  accountable,  less  sustainable,  and  less  just.""  |||    Mr  Blair  signed  the  constitution  at  a  ceremony  in  Rome  in  November,  but  had  already  made  it  clear  the  issue  would  be  put  to  voters  in  a  referendum.  That  promise  came  after  sustained  pressure  from  opposition  parties.  Jack  Straw,  who  argues  the  constitution  reflected  a  ""British  vision  for  Europe""  and  gives  ""national  governments  a  stronger  grip"",  has  said  the  referendum  could  be  held  in  spring  2006.  But  in  an  interview  with  the  Financial  Times,  Mr  Blair  refused  to  be  pinned  down  to  that  date,  saying  Britain  would  hold  a  poll  ""some  time  in  2006  but  when,  I  don't  know"".  The  paper  said  the  prime  minister  ""claimed  ignorance""  of  when  other  countries  were  planning  to  hold  their  referendums." 

1	"Pixies  take  on  Reading  and  Leeds  |||    Pixies,  Foo  Fighters  and  Iron  Maiden  will  headline  this  summer's  Leeds  and  Reading  festivals.  |||    The  trio  of  rock  heavyweights  will  top  the  bill  for  the  three-day  events  at  Bramham  Park,  near  Wetherby,  and  at  Richfield  Avenue,  Reading.  They  are  the  Pixies'  and  Iron  Maiden's  only  UK  festival  gigs,  while  Foo  Fighters  are  also  at  T  In  The  Park.  The  Killers,  Razorlight  and  Queens  of  the  Stone  Age  are  also  playing  the  twin  festivals,  to  be  held  on  26-28  August.  Other  acts  in  this  year's  line-up  include  The  Charlatans,  Marilyn  Manson  and  Kings  of  Leon.  Pete  Doherty's  band  Babyshamblers  will  appear  on  the  NME/Radio  One  stage  along  with  Kasabian,  Black  Rebel  Motorcycle  Club  and  Bloc  Party.  |||    Organiser  Mean  Fiddler  said  more  acts  were  still  to  be  confirmed  for  the  summer  event.  ""We  are  all  very  excited  to  be  going  back  to  Reading  and  intend  to  have  a  fantastic  time,""  said  Iron  Maiden's  Bruce  Dickinson.  ""We're  sure  fans  will  too.""  It  will  the  first  time  the  veteran  British  metal  band  have  played  Reading  in  23  years.  At  Leeds,  Iron  Maiden  will  headline  the  first  day  of  the  festival  on  the  Friday,  Pixies  will  follow  on  Saturday  and  the  Foo  Fighters  will  close  the  event  on  Sunday.  The  Pixies  will  headline  the  first  day  of  Reading,  while  Foo  Fighters  will  play  on  Sunday  and  Iron  Maiden  will  close  the  event.  Weekend  tickets  are  now  on  sale  priced  at  £125  each." 

1	"Beatles  suits  sell  for  $110,000  |||    Four  suits  worn  by  the  Beatles  on  their  Please  Please  Me  album  cover  have  sold  for  $110,00  (£59,000)  at  a  US  auction.  |||    But  some  of  Elvis  Presley's  earliest  recordings  -  including  takes  of  All  Shook  Up  -  failed  to  sell  at  the  Bonhams  and  Butterfields  two-day  sale.  A  private  collection  of  six  tape  recordings  of  Presley  valued  at  between  $30,000  (£16,000)  and  $50,000  (£27,000)  did  not  meet  their  reserve  price.  A  signed  Presley  photograph  managed  to  fetch  $2,115  (£1,140).  |||    Auction  spokesman  Erik  Simon  said  the  Presley  tapes  were  withdrawn  because  ""they  did  not  meet  the  minimum  price  set  by  the  owners"".  |||    He  said  the  family  of  sound  engineer  Thorne  Nogar  did  not  want  to  divulge  the  price  they  had  set  or  the  offers  they  had  received.  The  RCA  tapes  date  from  September  1956  to  September  1957.  The  ""pre-masters""  include  a  take  of  Jailhouse  Rock,  religious  songs,  material  for  his  first  Christmas  album,  and  banter  between  Presley,  members  of  his  band  and  Mr  Nogar.  |||    ""We've  had  them  for  a  lot  of  years,  and  I  think  the  people  should  enjoy  them.  And  frankly,  we  could  use  the  money,""  Mr  Nogar's  son  Stephen,  57,  said  before  the  auction.  Mr  Nogar,  who  died  in  1994  aged  72,  always  used  to  make  two  tapes  of  sessions  as  a  back-up  in  case  RCA  producers  wanted  to  make  late  changes  to  songs.  ""He  called  them  his  'ass-saver'  tapes,""  his  son  said.  The  quality  is  said  to  be  noticeably  crisper  than  that  of  a  new  vinyl  record.  Because  the  family  does  not  own  the  copyright  to  the  music,  the  tapes  could  only  be  sold  for  ""personal  enjoyment""  and  cannot  be  copied  for  commercial  gain.  The  auction  made  a  total  of  $1.1m  (£600,000)." 

2	"Profile:  David  Blunkett  |||    Before  he  resigned  the  position  of  home  secretary  on  Wednesday,  David  Blunkett  had  been  in  charge  of  a  substantial  body  of  government  portfolios  including  race,  policing  and  immigration.  |||    His  responsibilities  in  running  the  Home  Office  included  civil  emergencies,  security,  terrorism  and  expenditure.  Named  home  secretary  after  the  2001  general  election,  Mr  Blunkett  had  seen  the  focus  on  his  office  intensify.  The  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Center  on  11  September  2001  heightened  concern  for  security  and  immigration  in  particular.  A  Labour  loyalist  from  a  working  class  background  Mr  Blunkett,  57,  had  been  unafraid  of  pushing  for  tough  changes  to  Labour  policy.  |||    Recently  the  issue  of  identity  cards  had  provoked  controversy  with  questions  raised  over  cost  and  invasions  of  civil  liberties.  Mr  Blunkett  was  also  at  the  centre  of  a  humiliating  scandal  involving  the  former  immigration  minister  Beverly  Hughes.  Having  received  his  full  backing,  Ms  Hughes  was  forced  to  resign  in  April  over  abuses  in  the  visa  processing  system,  which  she  claimed  to  be  unaware  of.  Mr  Blunkett's  own  comments  on  immigration  had  prompted  censure  -  he  told  refugees  from  Afghanistan  and  Kosovo  to  ""get  back  home""  to  start  rebuilding  their  countries.  And  he  also  urged  people  from  ethnic  minorities  to  develop  a  ""sense  of  belonging""  in  Britain,  telling  them  to  speak  English  at  home.  Avoiding  political  correctness  is  second  nature  to  the  former  home  secretary,  who  spurns  a  metropolitan  elite  and  ""airy  fairy  libertarians""  and  earlier  in  the  year  coined  the  phrase  ""liberati"",  as  an  amalgam  of  ""glitterati""  and  ""liberal"".  Yet  in  January  of  this  year  he  courted  further  controversy  over  his  seemingly  liberal  reclassification  of  cannabis,  from  a  Grade  B  to  Grade  C  status  drug  .  |||    Before  the  recent  furore,  Mr  Blunkett  had  always  appeared  more  interested  in  politics  than  his  personal  life.  Mr  Blunkett  told  the  Daily  Telegraph  in  2001  that  he  continued  to  wear  his  wedding  ring,  in  spite  of  being  a  divorcee,  as  ""a  useful  way  of  ensuring  that  people  don't  casually  think  I  am  available"".  He  added:  ""I  am  not  available  because  I  am  just  getting  on  with  the  job.""  Mr  Blunkett  entered  Parliament  for  Sheffield  Brightside  in  1987,  after  first  contesting  the  Sheffield  Hallam  seat  in  1974.  He  is  one  of  very  few  blind  MPs,  and  was  the  first  to  reach  the  front  bench  and  the  Cabinet.  His  relaxed  performances  -  with  his  guide  dog  by  his  side  -  at  the  despatch  box,  in  the  Labour  Party's  National  Executive,  and  on  the  conference  platform  made  it  easy  to  forget  his  disability.  Mr  Blunkett  himself  described  not  being  able  to  see  as  simply  ""an  inconvenience"".  Using  Braille  for  speeches,  and  briefed  by  his  officials  on  tape,  he  also  has  a  sharp  tongue  at  times,  and  a  pragmatic  approach  to  politics.  |||    Mr  Blunkett  was  schooled  in  Sheffield  where  he  led  the  city  council  for  seven  years  before  entering  the  Commons.  He  chaired  the  Labour  Party  nationally,  and  was  a  unifying  force  in  the  80s  and  90s,  shadowing  health  and  education.  In  Tony  Blair's  first  government  Mr  Blunkett  was  put  in  charge  of  education  and  employment,  where  he  won  big  increases  in  funds  for  schools,  while  insisting  on  improved  standards  of  literacy  and  numeracy.  He  was  prepared  to  stand  up  to  the  teaching  unions  -  which  sometimes  heckled  his  speeches  -  and  his  policy  of  charging  university  students  for  tuition  fees  was  not  popular.  In  the  Labour  Party  he  has  been  regarded  as  a  loyal  colleague,  a  conciliator  who  avoids  factions,  and  a  man  whose  humour  and  determination  make  him  widely  popular.  There  have  been  wry  smiles  as  well.  In  1999,  his  then  guide  dog  Lucy  threw  up  in  the  Chamber  during  the  speech  of  his  Tory  opponent.  Lucy  was  replaced  by  her  half-sister,  Sadie,  a  black  Labrador-curly-coated  retriever  cross,  in  2003  after  nearly  a  decade  by  Mr  Blunkett's  side."

There  will  also  be  elections  for  local  councils  and  mayors  in  parts  of  England  on  5  May.  The  deadline  for  voters  to  register  in  Northern  Ireland  expired  on  Thursday.  |||    Completed  registration  forms  can  be  handed  into  local  authorities  throughout  the  day  on  Friday,  and  some  will  accept  them  by  fax.  As  well  as  for  English  county  councils,  polls  for  unitary  authorities  at  Bristol,  Isle  of  Wight  and  Stockton-on-Tees  and  mayors  at  Doncaster,  Hartlepool,  North  Tyneside  and  Stoke-on-Trent  are  also  scheduled  for  5  May.  Last  week  Preston  City  Council  reported  that  more  than  14,000  of  its  voters  were  not  registered.  Its  electoral  roll  fell  by  17.5%  in  a  year  -  the  biggest  dip  in  the  UK.  An  Electoral  Commission  spokeswoman  said:  ""Political  decisions  are  made  on  your  behalf  every  day  but  only  by  using  your  right  to  vote  at  an  election  can  you  really  have  a  say  on  the  issues  you  care  about.  ""If  you  want  your  voice  to  be  heard  on  5  May  you  will  need  to  have  registered  by  Friday  11  March.""  Council  tax  payers  are  not  eligible  to  vote  without  registration,  officials  have  stressed." 

2	"Lib  Dems  'to  target  stamp  duty'  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats  are  promising  to  raise  the  stamp  duty  threshold  if  they  win  the  general  election,  in  a  bid  to  court  first-time  house  buyers.  |||    Vince  Cable,  the  party's  Treasury  spokesman,  said  raising  the  threshold  to  £150,000  would  prevent  over  400,000  home-buyers  from  paying  the  tax.  He  said  first-time  buyers  were  being  ""squeezed  out""  of  the  housing  market.  The  Labour  party  said  the  Liberal  Democrats  needed  to  explain  how  they  would  pay  for  the  plan.  The  plan  forms  part  of  a  wider  Lib  Dems  policy  to  encourage  first  time  buyers  and  those  on  lower  incomes  into  the  market.  |||    Under  the  proposals,  the  average  saving  for  a  new  buyer  would  be  more  than  £1,000,  according  to  Mr  Cable.  ""First  time  buyers  are  being  squeezed  out  of  the  housing  market  not  only  by  higher  house  prices  but  also  by  being  swept  into  the  stamp  duty  net,""  he  said.  ""By  failing  to  uprate  the  stamp  duty  threshold  Gordon  Brown  has  hit  first  time  buyers  and  those  on  low  incomes  the  hardest.  ""By  pledging  to  increase  the  threshold  to  £150,000,  the  Liberal  Democrats  will  make  it  possible  for  many  first  time  buyers  to  buy  a  property  without  facing  this  tax.""  Paul  Boateng  MP,  Labour's  Chief  Secretary  to  the  Treasury,  said:  ""The  Lib  Dems'  sums  don't  add  up.  ""They  can  have  no  credibility  until  they  can  say  how  they  would  fund  their  ever  growing  list  of  tax  and  spending  commitments.""  Mr  Cable  will  publish  his  ""Alternative  Budget""  on  Monday."

A  member  of  The  Game's  entourage  was  reportedly  shot  outside  a  radio  station  where  50  Cent  was  being  interviewed.  But  the  pair  shook  hands  as  they  handed  over  money  to  music  projects  for  New  York's  deprived  areas  on  Wednesday.  |||    The  Game,  whose  real  name  is  Jayceon  Taylor,  told  a  news  conference:  ""I  want  to  apologise.  I'm  almost  ashamed  to  have  participated  in  the  things  that  went  on  over  the  last  few  weeks.""  Chart-topper  50  Cent,  real  name  Curtis  Jackson,  said  the  truce  came  on  the  anniversary  of  the  death  of  the  Notorious  BIG  in  1997,  who  was  part  of  a  volatile  feud  between  the  east  and  west  coast  rap  scenes.  ""We're  here  today  to  show  that  people  can  rise  above  the  most  difficult  circumstances  and  together  we  can  put  negativity  behind  us,""  50  Cent  said.  |||    ""A  lot  of  people  don't  want  to  see  it  happen,  but  we're  responding  to  the  two  most  important  groups  -  our  family  and  our  fans.""  The  Boys  Choir  of  Harlem  got  a  cheque  for  $150,000  (£77,800)  from  50  Cent,  while  The  Game  handed  over  $103,500  (£53,400).  The  Game  also  made  a  contribution  to  the  Compton  schools  music  programme.  50  Cent  announced  he  has  launched  the  G-Unity  Foundation  ""to  help  people  overcome  obstacles  and  make  a  chance  for  the  better  in  their  lives"".  |||    ""I  realised  that  if  I'm  going  to  be  effective  at  that,  I  have  to  overcome  some  of  my  own,""  he  said.  ""Game  and  I  need  to  set  an  example  in  the  community.""  50  Cent  is  no  stranger  to  feuds,  with  rapper  Ja  Rule  among  the  targets  for  ridicule  in  his  songs.  On  his  latest  album,  released  earlier  this  month,  he  turned  his  attentions  to  Fat  Joe  and  Nas,  who  have  both  worked  with  Ja  Rule.  Both  he  and  The  Game  have  admitted  drug  dealing  in  the  past  and  have  both  been  shot." 

2	"Plaid  MP's  cottage  arson  claim  |||    A  Plaid  Cymru  MP  believes  UK  security  services  were  involved  in  some  arson  attacks  blamed  on  Welsh  extremists.  |||    It  is  25  years  since  the  start  of  12  years  of  fire-bombings,  attributed  to  a  shadowy  group  known  as  Meibion  Glyndwr.  Plaid  Cymru's  Elfyn  Llwyd  has  suggested  the  security  services  could  have  been  involved,  with  the  intention  of  discrediting  the  nationalist  vote.  Ex-Welsh  Office  Minister  Lord  Roberts  of  Conwy  denied  security  services  were  involved.  In  March  this  year,  North  Wales  Police  reopened  the  case,  saying  materials  kept  during  their  investigations  would  be  examined  to  find  whether  it  would  yield  DNA  evidence.  |||    Meibion  Glyndwr  -  which  means  ""sons  of  Glyndwr""  -  began  burning  property  in  December  1979  in  protest  at  homes  in  rural  Wales  being  sold  as  holiday  cottages  to  people  from  England.  The  group  was  linked  to  most  of  the  220  or  so  fire-bombing  incidents  stretching  from  the  Llyn  Peninsula  to  Pembrokeshire.  The  campaign  continued  until  the  early  1990s.  Police  were  accused  in  some  quarters  of  targeting  anyone  who  was  a  nationalist.  Although  one  man,  Sion  Aubrey  Roberts,  was  convicted  in  1993  of  sending  letter  bombs  in  the  post,  the  arson  cases  remain  unsolved.  |||    As  a  solicitor,  Elfyn  Llwyd  represented  Welsh  singer  Bryn  F&#244;n  when  he  was  arrested  on  suspicion  of  being  involved  in  the  arson  campaign.  F&#244;n  was  released  without  charge  .  But  now,  as  MP  for  Merionnydd  Nant  Conwy  and  Plaid  Cymru's  Parliamentary  Leader,  Mr  Llwyd  has  argued  that  some  of  the  terror  attacks  may  have  had  the  involvement  of  the  security  services  and  not  Meibion  Glyndwr.  He  believes  that  elements  of  the  British  security  services  may  have  carried  out  renegade  actions  in  order  to  discredit  Plaid  Cymru  and  the  nationalist  vote  ahead  of  elections.  The  claim  is  made  in  an  interview  for  BBC  Wales'  Maniffesto  programme  to  be  shown  on  S4C  on  Sunday.  |||    Mr  Llwyd  said  that  the  sophistication  of  many  of  the  devices  used  in  the  attacks  compared  to  the  crude  nature  of  many  others,  suggests  a  degree  of  professionalism  which  could  only  have  come  from  individuals  who  knew  exactly  what  they  were  doing.  He  said:  ""What  I'm  saying  is  that  the  role  that  they  took  wasn't  the  appropriate  one,  i.e.  like  an  |||    agent  provocateur  |||    and  perhaps  interfering  and  creating  a  situation  where  it  looked  like  it  was  the  nationalists  that  were  responsible.""  The  programme  also  heard  from  Lord  Roberts  of  Conwy,  who  was  a  Welsh  Office  minister  at  the  time.  He  denied  that  the  security  services  played  any  improper  role.  Mr  Llwyd's  theory  has  also  been  questioned  by  Plaid  Cymru's  former  President,  Dafydd  Wigley.  He  accepted  that  the  fires  damaged  Plaid  Cymru's  public  image  but  believed  that  the  security  services  had  their  hands  full  at  the  time  with  the  IRA  and  animal  rights  activists.  |||        -  Maniffesto  can  be  seen  on  S4C  on  Sunday,  12  December,  at  1200  GMT." 

3	"Campbell  to  be  Lions  consultant  |||    Former  government  communications  chief  Alastair  Campbell  will  act  as  a  media  consultant  to  Sir  Clive  Woodward's  2005  Lions  on  their  tour  to  New  Zealand.  |||    Campbell,  who  left  Downing  Street  earlier  this  year,  will  advise  on  media  strategy  before  and  during  the  tour.  ""I  hope  I  can  contribute  to  the  planning  and  preparation,  and  to  ensuring  the  media  and  public  get  the  most  out  of  the  tour  itself,""  he  said.  ""I  am  also  looking  forward  to  going  out  for  the  later  stages  of  the  tour.""  Woodward's  decision  to  call  in  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair's  former  spin  doctor  springs  from  the  deterioration  in  media  relations  on  the  last  Lions  tour  of  Australia  in  2001,  when  New  Zealander  Graham  Henry  was  the  head  coach.  The  furore  surrounding  the  newspaper  diaries  of  Matt  Dawson  and  Austin  Healey  was  compounded  by  other  disillusioned  players  venting  their  frustration  through  the  media.  ""The  Lions  is  a  massive  media  event,""  said  Woodward,  who  will  be  the  head  coach.  ""There  will  be  a  huge  level  of  interest  from  the  travelling  media,  the  fans  that  will  go  out  in  their  thousands  and  the  New  Zealand  public.  ""We  need  to  have  the  strategy  and  processes  in  place  to  deal  with  the  pressures  that  will  bring.  ""[Alastair]  will  act  as  an  advisor  both  in  the  build  up  to  and  on  the  tour  itself.  His  role  is  to  work  closely  with  not  only  myself  but  (tour  manager)  Bill  Beaumont,  (media  manager)  Louisa  Cheetham  and  (team  manager)  Louise  Ramsay.""  Campbell  is  due  to  resume  working  for  the  government  in  the  new  year  in  the  build-up  to  an  anticipated  May  general  election.

1	"Beastie  Boys  win  sampling  battle  |||    US  rappers  Beastie  Boys  have  won  their  long-running  battle  over  the  use  of  a  sample  in  their  song  Pass  the  Mic.  |||    The  punk-rappers  used  three  notes  of  music  from  flautist  James  Newton's  Choir  in  their  track  from  1992.  Although  the  group  had  paid  a  licence  fee  for  the  sample,  Mr  Newton  said  his  copyright  had  been  infringed.  But  the  US  Court  of  Appeal  upheld  its  original  decision  that  the  group  did  not  have  to  pay  an  additional  fee  to  license  the  underlying  composition.  The  Beastie  Boys  -  Michael  Diamond,  Adam  Horowitz,  and  Adam  Yauch  -  are  considered  to  be  one  of  early  pioneers  of  sampling  music.  |||    Sampling,  now  a  standard  practice  among  musicians,  involves  taking  a  segment  of  one  track  and  using  it  in  a  different  song.  A  three-judge  panel  of  the  court  held  in  2003  that  the  band  had  abided  by  copyright  protections  by  paying  a  licence  fee  for  a  sample  of  Mr  Newton's  recording.  That  finding  upheld  a  lower-court  dismissal  of  the  case  in  favour  of  the  Beastie  Boys.  ""We  hold  that  Beastie  Boys'  use  of  a  brief  segment  of  that  composition,  consisting  of  three  notes  separated  by  a  half-step  over  a  background  C  note,  is  not  sufficient  to  sustain  a  claim  for  infringement  of  Newton's  copyright,""  Chief  Judge  Mary  Schroeder  wrote  in  her  opinion.  Mr  Newton  is  a  critically  acclaimed  jazz  and  classical  flutist,  composer,  performer,  and  university  professor.  Mr  Newton  and  the  Beastie  Boys  were  not  available  for  comment." 

3	"Arnesen  denies  rift  with  Santini  |||    Tottenham  sporting  director  Frank  Arnesen  has  denied  that  coach  Jacques  Santini  resigned  because  of  a  clash  of  personalities  at  White  Hart  Lane.  |||    There  had  been  newspaper  speculation  that  Santini  had  felt  undermined  by  Arnesen's  role  at  the  club.  ""It  is  absolutely  not  true,""  Arnesen  told  BBC  Radio  Five  Live.  ""There  is  only  one  thing  that  made  him  resign  and  that  is  his  own  personal  problems.  ""He  has  talked  to  me  recently  and  said  this  matter  is  absolutely  for  himself.""  Arnesen  said  he  was  unable  to  throw  any  light  onto  the  problems  that  caused  Santini  to  quit  after  just  13  games  in  charge.  He  added:  ""Jacques  has  never  gone  into  exactly  what  it  was.  But  I  trust  him  in  that;  you  have  to  accept  it.  I  think  we  should  respect  it.  |||    ""The  plan  is  now  that  over  the  weekend  we  will  have  talks  with  the  board  and  then  on  Monday  we  will  clarify  the  situation.""  Arnesen  countered  criticism  at  the  timing  of  the  announcement,  coming  less  than  24  hours  before  Tottenham's  Premiership  fixture  with  Charlton.  ""When  it  comes  down  to  personal  problems,  I  don't  think  we  should  talk  about  timing,""  he  said.  And  he  also  denied  reports  that  Santini  had  been  given  a  £3m  pay-off.  ""That  is  absolute  nonsense.  He  is  the  one  who  said  'I  will  go'  and  so  he  went'"",  said  the  Spurs  sporting  director.  Tottenham's  structure  of  having  a  sporting  director  working  alongside  a  coach  is  based  on  a  continental  model  and  Arnesen  sees  no  reason  why  they  should  change  it.  |||    ""I  have  confidence  in  this  structure.  I  am  confident  that  we  have  started  something  here  in  July  and  I  still  have  a  lot  of  confidence  in  Tottenham  and  what  we  are  doing,""  he  said.  However,  former  Spurs  and  England  defender  Gary  Stevens  said  he  would  not  be  surprised  if  the  system  had  caused  a  rift.  ""I  think  the  problems  go  a  lot  deeper,  between  the  director  of  football  at  White  Hart  Lane  and  Santini,""  Stevens  told  Five  Live.  ""On  paper  they  could  have  worked  together.  But  Frank  Arnesen  was  a  very  creative,  forward-thinking  and  expansive  player  -  whereas  I  think  Santini  was  very  much  the  opposite,  more  a  case  of  being  organised,  disciplined  and  happy  not  conceding  goals.  ""That  sort  of  arrangement  can  work  if  the  two  people  have  the  same  principles  and  ideals  and  work  very  closely.  But  it  seems  that  has  not  happened."""

It  obliges  all  firms  with  US  stock  market  listings  to  make  declarations,  which,  critics  say,  will  add  substantially  to  the  cost  of  preparing  their  annual  accounts.  |||    Firms  that  break  the  new  law  could  face  huge  fines,  while  senior  executives  risk  jail  terms  of  up  to  20  years.  Mr  Donaldson  said  that  although  the  Act  does  not  provide  exemptions  for  foreign  firms,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  would  ""continue  to  be  sensitive  to  the  need  to  accomodate  foreign  structures  and  requirements"".  There  are  few,  if  any,  who  disagree  with  the  intentions  of  the  Act,  which  obliges  chief  executives  to  sign  a  statement  taking  responsibility  for  the  accuracy  of  the  accounts.  But  European  firms  with  secondary  listings  in  New  York  have  objected  -  arguing  that  the  compliance  costs  outweigh  the  benefits  of  a  dual  listing.  The  Act  also  applies  to  firms  with  more  than  300  US  shareholders,  a  situation  many  firms  without  US  listings  could  find  themselves  in.  |||    The  300-shareholder  threshold  has  drawn  anger  as  it  effectively  blocks  the  most  obvious  remedy,  a  delisting.  Mr  Donaldson  said  the  SEC  would  ""consider  whether  there  should  be  a  new  approach  to  the  deregistration  process""  for  foreign  firms  unwilling  to  meet  US  requirements.  |||    ""We  should  seek  a  solution  that  will  preserve  investor  protections""  without  turning  the  US  market  into  ""one  with  no  exit"",  he  said.  He  revealed  that  his  staff  were  already  weighing  up  the  merits  of  delaying  the  implementation  of  the  Act's  least  popular  measure  -  Section  404  -  for  foreign  firms.  Seen  as  particularly  costly  to  implement,  Section  404  obliges  chief  executives  to  take  responsibility  for  the  firm's  internal  controls  by  signing  a  compliance  statement  in  the  annual  accounts.  The  SEC  has  already  delayed  implementation  of  this  clause  for  smaller  firms  -  including  US  ones  -  with  market  capitalisations  below  $700m  (£374m).  |||    A  delegation  of  European  firms  visited  the  SEC  in  December  to  press  for  change,  the  Financial  Times  reported.  |||    It  was  led  by  Digby  Jones,  director  general  of  the  UK's  Confederation  of  British  Industry  (CBI)  and  included  representatives  of  BASF,  Siemens  and  Cadbury  Schweppes.  Compliance  costs  are  already  believed  to  be  making  firms  wary  of  US  listings.  Air  China  picked  the  London  Stock  Exchange  for  its  secondary  listing  in  its  $1.07bn  (£558m)  stock  market  debut  last  month.  There  are  also  rumours  that  two  Chinese  state-run  banks  -  China  Construction  Bank  and  Bank  of  China  -  have  abandoned  plans  for  multi-billion  dollar  listings  in  New  York  later  this  year.  Instead,  the  cost  of  Sarbanes-Oxley  has  persuaded  them  to  stick  to  a  single  listing  in  Hong  Kong,  according  to  press  reports  in  China."

The  work,  written  for  the  wedding  of  a  daughter  of  a  German  customs  official,  was  missing  for  80  years.  Joshua  Rifkin  -  a  composer  and  leading  interpreter  of  Bach  -  has  recreated  the  missing  instrumental  parts.  |||    He  said  he  originally  wanted  to  let  the  lost  cantata  lie  in  rest.  ""Maybe  a  fragment  should  stay  a  fragment,""  said  Rifkin.  ""Then  I  thought  of  palaeontologists,  from  one  bone  they  figure  the  entire  dinosaur.  This  is  my  dinosaur.""  The  eight  rediscovered  pages  consist  of  vocal  pieces  in  German  for  soprano  and  alto,  with  the  seven  movements  lasting  for  a  total  of  between  20  and  25  minutes.  The  instrumental  parts  were  entirely  lost  except  for  two  recycled  movements,  a  duet  and  an  aria  which  had  been  used  elsewhere  in  Bach's  work.  Rifkin  likened  the  challenge  to  a  ""musical  Rubik's  cube"".  ""I  could  not  reconstruct  what  Bach  wrote  but  I  could  give  the  people  of  today  an  idea  of  what  his  music  was  like,""  he  said.  ""It  sounds  like  Bach's  music,  but  the  listener  should  not  know  which  part  is  Bach's  and  which  part  is  mine."""

Tacit  approval  from  the  White  House  for  the  weaker  greenback,  which  could  help  counteract  huge  deficits,  has  helped  trigger  the  move.  But  now  Europe  says  the  euro  has  had  enough,  and  Asia  must  now  share  some  of  the  burden.  |||    China  is  seen  as  the  main  culprit,  with  exports  soaring  up  35%  in  2004  partly  on  the  back  of  a  currency  pegged  to  the  dollar.  ""Asia  should  engage  in  greater  currency  flexibility,""  said  French  finance  minister  Herve  Gaymard,  after  a  meeting  with  his  German  counterpart  Hans  Eichel.  Markets  responded  by  pushing  the  euro  lower,  in  the  expectation  that  the  rhetoric  -  and  the  pressure  -  is  unlikely  to  ease  ahead  of  a  meeting  of  the  G7  industrialised  countries  next  week.  Early  on  Tuesday  morning,  the  dollar  had  edged  higher  to  1.3040  euros.  The  yen,  meanwhile,  had  strengthened  to  102.975  against  the  dollar  by  0730  GMT."

Her  departure  will  come  into  effect  on  1  February  and  follows  the  departure  of  co-chief  executive  Rebecca  Navarednam  on  1  January.  Ms  Mohd-Saaid  is  to  be  replaced  by  Lillian  Tan,  presently  a  non-executive  director  of  the  company  and  head  of  a  Malaysian  retailer.  |||    In  a  statement  issued  on  Thursday,  Laura  Ashley  thanked  Ms  Mohd-Saaid  for  her  services  to  the  company.  Its  shares  were  down  8.51%  to  10.75p  in  late  Thursday  morning  trading  on  the  London  Stock  Exchange.  |||    Since  2002,  Ms  Tan  has  been  managing  director  and  chief  executive  of  Metrojaya,  one  of  the  largest  retail  groups  in  Malaysia.  Laura  Ashley,  which  is  due  to  issue  its  next  trading  statement  in  the  next  few  weeks,  has  in  recent  months  been  hit  by  reports  of  poor  sales.  In  October  last  year,  it  announced  the  closure  of  one  of  its  two  Welsh  factories.  In  September,  the  company  had  said  that  its  half-year  clothing  sales  had  been  ""below  expectations"".  In  recent  times,  it  has  put  renewed  focus  on  home  furnishings  rather  than  clothing,  but  last  September  it  reported  that  interim  six  month  losses  had  risen  from  £1m  to  £1.2m,  while  sales  had  fallen  from  £138m  to  £118m.  |||    Laura  Ashley,  which  floated  on  the  London  Stock  Exchange  for  £200m  ($376m)  in  1995,  is  majority-owned  by  Malaysia  entrepreneur  Dr  Khoo  Kay  Peng.  In  1996,  its  share  price  was  more  than  200p.  It  has  long  been  reported  that  Dr  Khoo  intends  to  take  the  company  private,  but  he  has  always  denied  this.  ""Laura  Ashley  is  a  bit  of  a  shrivelled  husk  of  a  company,""  said  retail  analyst  Nick  Bubb  of  Evolution  Securities.  ""It  is  all  pretty  odd  with  its  Malaysian  owners  seemingly  just  shuffling  the  deckchairs.""  Laura  Ashley  was  founded  by  its  late  namesake  in  Kent  in  1955,  before  moving  to  Mid  Wales  in  1961  where  it  still  has  its  main  UK  factory." 

2	"Row  over  'police'  power  for  CSOs  |||    The  Police  Federation  has  said  it  strongly  opposes  giving  Community  Support  Officers  (CSOs)  the  power  to  detain  suspects  for  up  to  30  minutes.  |||    The  powers  -  piloted  in  six  areas  -  were  extended  to  all  police  forces  in  England  and  Wales  on  Thursday.  The  federation  said  CSOs  do  not  have  the  experience,  training  and  safety  equipment  to  deal  with  ""potentially  confrontational""  situations.  But  the  government  said  the  move  would  help  police  ""build  safe  communities"".  Police  Federation  chairman  Jan  Berry  said  civilian  officers  should  act  as  ""eyes  and  ears""  for  the  police.  |||    ""They  should  not  be  placed  in  potentially  confrontational  situations  -  which  detaining  someone  clearly  is,""  she  said.  CSOs  can  now  use  reasonable  force  to  detain  suspects  for  up  to  30  minutes  while  they  wait  for  police  officers  to  arrive.  The  powers  will  be  granted  by  chief  constables  of  local  forces.  Ms  Berry  said  this  ""dramatically  changes""  their  original  purpose  -  to  be  a  visible  presence  combating  low-level  crime  and  anti-social  behaviour.  She  said  more  powers  would  mean  more  paperwork  and  less  time  on  the  street.  |||    But  Home  Office  minister  Hazel  Blears  defended  the  move  saying  it  would  give  the  civilian  officers  ""just  that  little  bit  of  edge"".  She  denied  their  role  was  changing  and  said  the  new  powers  would  not  take  them  away  from  the  streets.  |||    ""The  powers  that  we  are  bringing  in  are  things  that  they  need  to  do  when  they  are  out  patrolling,""  she  said.  The  Home  Office  has  produced  its  own  report  on  CSOs  which  it  describes  as  ""encouraging"".  Ms  Blears  said  the  study  shows  CSOs  are  ""making  a  real  difference""  in  the  fight  against  crime.  But  the  report  also  showed  that  the  public  is  having  difficulties  distinguishing  between  a  civilian  officer  and  a  proper  officer.  |||    Shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  said  the  research  appeared  to  acknowledge  that  CSOs  were  having  no  discernible  effect  on  crime  figures.  |||    ""While  the  answer  is  a  lot  more  real  police,  the  government  wants  to  recruit  25,000  people  who  can't  arrest  anyone,""  he  said.  BBC  home  affairs  correspondent  Danny  Shaw  said  the  research  is  inconclusive.  There  are  about  3,500  CSOs  in  England  and  Wales  but  the  government  intends  to  have  25,000  on  the  streets  by  2008  at  a  cost  of  £50m.  They  already  have  powers  to  hand  out  fines  for  a  wide  range  of  offences.  The  Serious  Organised  Crime  and  Police  Bill  proposes  extra  powers  to  search  suspects,  enforce  licensing  offences,  direct  traffic  and  deter  begging." 

2	"Lib  Dems  unveil  women's  manifesto  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats  are  attempting  to  woo  female  voters  with  the  launch  of  their  manifesto  for  women.  |||    Charles  Kennedy  is  pledging  a  maternity  income  guarantee  and  a  pension  system  based  on  years  of  residence  rather  than  national  insurance  payments.  He  also  thinks  women  will  back  plans  to  end  university  tuition  fees  and  for  free  long-term  care  for  the  elderly.  Both  Labour  and  the  Conservatives  have  said  they  also  plan  to  boost  pensions  and  to  improve  childcare  support.  Mr  Kennedy  says  he  wants  to  deal  with  policy  areas  that  disadvantage  women.  ""Two  million  pensioners  in  Britain  currently  live  below  the  government's  own  poverty  line  -  two-thirds  of  whom  are  women,""  he  said.  |||    He  says  that  pensions  based  on  the  number  of  years  worked  ignore  the  contribution  women  make  caring  for  children.  The  Lib  Dem's  Citizen's  Pension,  based  on  length  of  residency  not  on  national  insurance  contributions,  would  address  that  imbalance,  Mr  Kennedy  argues.  Under  the  package,  new  mothers  would  be  offered  minimum  guaranteed  maternity  pay  of  £170  a  week  for  the  first  six  months  after  the  birth  of  their  first  child.  Mr  Kennedy  also  believes  the  party's  plans  to  use  the  money  saved  from  not  introducing  ""illiberal""  ID  cards  to  boost  police  numbers  by  10,000  would  appeal  to  women  too.  The  policies  are  not  new  announcements,  but  the  way  they  are  structured  as  a  package  to  appeal  to  women  is.  |||    Mr  Kennedy  also  points  to  the  fact  that  40%  of  the  party's  candidates  set  to  stand  in  winnable  or  target  seats  are  women.  Party  strategists  claim  that  where  women  candidates  replace  men  turnout  rises  by  4%.  Mr  Kennedy  began  the  pitch  for  female  support  with  an  interview  on  BBC  Radio  4's  Women's  Hour  on  Monday.  During  the  interview  Mr  Kennedy  revealed  that  he  planned  to  structure  the  party's  general  election  campaign  around  the  birth  of  his  first  child,  which  is  expected  in  April.  The  baby  and  his  wife  Sarah  would  be  ""priority  number  one""  even  if  it  arrived  in  the  middle  of  the  election  campaign,  he  said.  |||    Party  strategists  believe  winning  over  a  significant  proportion  of  women  voters  is  key  to  electoral  success.  A  party  spokesman  said  it  was  courting  female  votes  because  they  tended  to  vote  more  than  men  and  are  believed  to  be  more  considered  and  open-minded  in  deciding  who  they  vote  for.  Labour's  deputy  minister  for  women  Jacqui  Smith  accused  the  Lib  Dems  of  offering  ""false  promises""  to  women  and  said  their  sums  did  not  add  up.  She  said:  ""These  proposals  would  increase  the  costs  to  the  public  purse  drastically  year  on  year,  and  hard  working  families  will  pay  dearly,  through  either  increased  taxes  or  reduced  spending  on  public  services"".  The  Labour  party  has  committed  itself  to  ""universal,  affordable  and  flexible""  childcare  for  parents  of  all  3  to  14  year-olds,  including  childcare  centred  on  schools  to  be  available  from  8am  to  6pm.  In  September,  Trade  and  Industry  Secretary  Patricia  Hewitt  said  she  would  like  to  see  longer  paid  maternity  leave,  higher  paternity  pay  and  the  extension  of  flexible  working  rights  to  carers,  if  Labour  won  a  third  term.  The  Conservatives  are  yet  to  unveil  their  manifesto  plans  for  childcare  but  said  in  November  they  would  increase  maternity  pay  and  pay  the  child  tax  credit  in  cash  to  parents  to  spend  as  they  like,  on  a  nanny,  au  pair  or  even  a  family  member,  such  as  a  grandparent,  acting  as  a  carer.  They  were  also  consulting  on  making  childcare  costs  tax  deductible." 

3	"Nadal  puts  Spain  2-0  up  |||    Result:  Nadal  6-7  (6/8)  6-2  7-6  (8/6)  6-2  Roddick  |||    Spain's  Rafael  Nadal  beats  Andy  Roddick  of  the  USA  in  the  second  singles  match  rubber  of  the  2004  Davis  Cup  final  in  Seville.  Spain  lead  1-0  after  Carlos  Moya  beat  Mardy  Fish  in  straight  sets  in  the  opening  match  of  the  tie.  |||    Nadal  holds  his  nerve  and  the  crowd  goes  wild  as  Spain  go  2-0  up  in  the  tie.  |||    Roddick  holds  serve  to  force  Nadal  to  serve  for  the  match  but  the  American  surely  cannot  turn  things  around  now.  |||    Nadal  works  Roddick  around  the  court  on  two  consecutive  points  to  earn  two  break  points.  One  is  enough,  the  Spaniard  secures  the  double-break  and  Roddick  is  now  teetering  on  the  edge.  |||    Roddick  is  trying  to  gee  himself  up  but  the  clay  surface  is  taking  its  toll  on  his  game  and  he  is  looking  tired.  Nadal  wins  the  game  to  love.  |||    Nadal  steps  up  the  pressure  to  break  and  Spain  have  the  early  initiative  in  the  fourth  set.  |||    Nadal  also  holds  convincingly  as  both  players  feel  their  way  into  the  fourth  set.  |||    Roddick  shrugs  off  the  disappointment  of  losing  the  third-set  tiebreak  and  breezes  through  his  first  service  game  of  the  fourth  set.  |||    Nadal  earns  the  first  mini-break  in  the  tiebreak  as  the  match  enters  its  fourth  hour.  A  couple  of  stunning  points  follow,  one  where  Nadal  chases  down  a  Roddick  shot  and  turns  into  a  passing  winner.  Then  Roddick  produces  some  amazing  defence  at  the  net  to  take  the  score  to  4-4.  Roddick  has  two  serves  for  the  set  but  double-faults  to  take  the  score  to  5-5.  Nadal  saves  a  Roddick  set  point  then  earns  his  own  with  a  drive  volley  -  and  a  crosscourt  passing  winner  sends  the  crowd  wild.  |||    Nadal  tries  to  up  his  aggression  and  he  passes  Roddick  down  the  line  to  go  15-40  and  two  set  points  up.  Roddick  saves  the  first  with  a  desperate  lunge  volley  and  smacks  a  volley  winner  across  the  court  to  take  the  score  back  to  deuce  before  securing  the  game.  The  set  will  go  to  another  tiebreak.  |||    Nadal  enjoys  another  straightforward  hold  and  Roddick  must  once  again  serve  to  stay  in  the  set.  |||    Roddick  again  holds  on,  despite  some  brilliant  shot-making  from  his  opponent.  |||    Nadal  races  through  his  service  game  to  put  the  pressure  straight  back  onto  Roddick.  |||    Roddick  hangs  in  on  his  serve  to  level  matters  but  Nadal  is  making  him  fight  for  every  point.  |||    Nadal  could  be  suffering  a  disappointment  hangover  from  the  previous  game  as  he  goes  0-30  down  and  then  has  to  save  a  break  point  after  a  tremendous  rally  in  which  he  is  forced  into  some  brilliant  defence.  But  it  pays  off  and  the  Spaniard  edges  ahead  in  the  set.  |||    Roddick's  serve  is  not  firing  as  ferociously  as  usual  and  has  to  rely  on  his  sheer  competitive  determination  to  stay  in  the  set.  Three  times,  Nadal  forces  a  break  point  and  three  times  the  world  number  two  hangs  in.  And  Roddick's  grit  pays  off  as  he  manages  to  hold.  |||    Roddick  still  looks  a  bit  sluggish  but  he  attacks  the  net  and  is  rewarded  with  a  break  point,  which  Nadal  saves  with  a  good  first  serve  and  the  Spaniard  goes  on  to  hold.  |||    There  is  a  disruption  in  play  as  Roddick  is  upset  about  something  in  the  crowd.  The  Spanish  captain  gets  involved  as  does  the  match  referee  but  it  is  unclear  what  the  problem  is.  One  thing  for  certain  is  that  the  crowd  are  roused  into  support  of  Nadal  and  they  go  wild  when  Roddick  loses  the  next  point  and  goes  break  point  down.  Roddick  saves  the  break  point  and  then  bangs  down  his  ninth  ace  before  clinching  the  game  with  a  service  winner.  |||    The  game  passes  the  two-hour  mark  as  Nadal  holds  serve  to  edge  ahead  in  the  third  set.  |||    Now  Roddick  has  to  defend  a  break  point  and  he  produces  a  characteristic  ace  to  save  it.  It  is  immediately  followed  by  another  and  he  holds  with  a  little  dinked  half-volley  winner.  |||    Roddick  is  looking  a  little  leaden-footed  but  does  carve  out  a  break  point  for  himself.  But  he  plays  it  poorly  and  Nadal  avoids  the  danger.  |||    Roddick  has  gone  off  the  boil  and  again  struggles.  He  fails  to  get  down  properly  for  a  low  forehand  volley  and  gives  Nadal  three  break  points.  The  American  blasts  an  ace  to  save  one  but  follows  up  with  a  double  fault  and  the  rubber  is  level.  |||    Nadal  edges  towards  taking  the  second  set  with  a  comfortable  hold.  |||    Two  good  serves  put  Roddick  30-0  up  but  he  then  makes  a  couple  of  errors  to  find  himself  30-40  down.  He  saves  the  break  point  with  an  ace  and  then  manages  to  hold.  |||    Roddick's  level  has  dropped  while  Nadal  is  on  a  hot  streak.  The  Spaniard  includes  a  superb  crosscourt  winner  off  the  back  foot  as  he  races  through  his  service  game  without  dropping  a  point.  |||    Roddick  double-faults  twice  and  Nadal  takes  full  advantage  of  the  break  point  offered,  powering  a  passing  winner  past  Roddick.  |||    Nadal  wins  another  tight  game.  Neither  player  has  dipped  from  the  high  standard  of  play  in  the  first  set.  |||    Nadal  puts  the  American  under  pressure  and  Roddick  saves  a  break  point  with  a  superb  stop  volley  before  going  on  to  hold.  |||    Nadal  puts  the  disappointment  of  losing  the  first-set  tiebreak  to  claim  the  opening  game  in  the  second.  |||    Roddick  double-faults  to  concede  the  first  mini-break  and  then  Nadal  loops  a  crosscourt  winner  to  seize  advantage  in  the  tiebreak.  He  lets  one  slip  but  wins  his  next  serve  to  earn  three  set  points.  But  Roddick  saves  them  and  then  earns  one  himself.  Nadal  comes  up  with  a  down-the-line  winner  but  then  nets  tamely  on  Roddick's  next  set  point.  |||    Nadal's  nerve  is  tested  as  he  tries  to  force  a  tiebreak.  Both  players  come  up  with  some  scintillating  tennis  and  the  Spaniard  has  several  chances  to  clinch  the  game  before  finally  doing  so  when  Roddick  drives  wide.  |||    A  pulsating  game  sees  Nadal  racing  round  the  court  retrieving  and  refusing  to  give  Roddick  any  easy  points.  The  point  of  the  match  so  far  involves  Roddick's  slam-dunk  smash  being  returned  by  Nadal  before  Roddick  finally  manages  to  end  the  rally.  On  the  very  next  point,  Nadal  blasts  a  forehand  service  return  from  right  of  court  that  passes  Roddick  and  even  the  American  is  forced  to  applaud.  But  Roddick  comes  up  with  two  big  serves  to  polish  off  the  game.  |||    Nadal  outplays  Roddick  to  reach  40-0  but  the  American  fights  back  to  40-30  before  Nadal's  powerful  crosscourt  forehand  winner  secures  the  game.  |||    The  crowd  are  getting  very  involved,  cheering  between  Roddick's  first  and  second  serves.  But  the  American  comes  through  to  hold  and  edge  ahead  in  the  set.  |||    Nadal  manages  to  hold  again  despite  Roddick  piling  the  pressure  on  his  serve.  The  Spaniard  wins  the  game  courtesy  of  another  lucky  net  cord.  |||    Roddick  double  faults  buts  manages  to  keep  his  composure.  A  well-placed  serve  is  unreturnable  and  Roddick  holds.  |||    A  powerful  ace  down  the  middle  gives  Nadal  a  simple  love  service  game  -  the  first  time  he  has  held  serve  so  far  in  the  match.  If  Roddick  didn't  know  before,  he  knows  now  that  he  is  in  a  real  contest.  |||    Another  superb  game  as  Nadal  breaks  to  once  again  lift  the  roof.  He  produces  some  fine  groundstrokes  to  leave  Roddick  chasing  shadows.  Four  of  the  first  five  games  have  seen  a  break  of  serve.  |||    Despite  the  disappointment  of  losing  his  serve,  Roddick  is  not  phased  and  storms  into  a  40-15  lead  when  the  umpire  leaves  his  seat  to  confirm  a  close  line-call.  Nadal  takes  the  next  point  but  Roddick  breaks  again  with  a  sharp  volley  at  the  net.  |||    Roddick's  advantage  is  short  lived  as  Nadal  breaks  back  immediately.  A  fortunate  net  cord  helps  the  Spaniard  on  his  way  and  when  Roddick  fires  a  forehand  cross  court  shot  wide  to  lose  his  serve,  Nadal  pumps  his  fist  in  celebration.  |||    The  American  is  pumped  up  for  this  clash  and  takes  on  Nadal's  serve  from  the  start.  Nadal's  drop  shot  is  agonisingly  called  out  and  Roddick  claims  the  vital  first  break.  |||    After  Moya's  win  in  the  opening  rubber,  a  raucous  Seville  crowd  is  buoyed  by  Nadal's  impressive  start  which  sees  him  race  into  a  30-0  lead.  However  Roddick  fights  back  to  hold  his  serve." 

2	"Woolf  murder  sentence  rethink  |||    Plans  to  give  murderers  lighter  sentences  if  they  plead  guilty  have  been  watered  down.  |||    There  was  an  outcry  three  months  ago  when  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  Council  -  led  by  Lord  Woolf  -  published  its  proposals  for  England  and  Wales.  It  had  suggested  judges  should  reduce  sentences  by  a  third  for  murderers  who  confessed  at  the  earliest  opportunity.  But  that  has  now  been  changed  to  one-sixth,  with  no  reduction  for  those  killers  given  a  ""whole  life  tariff"".  At  the  time  Lord  Woolf,  the  Lord  Chief  Justice,  had  said  the  one  third  reduction  would  only  be  in  extraordinary  circumstances  -  for  example,  if  people  gave  themselves  up  before  their  crime  had  even  been  detected.  The  guidelines  were  to  recognise  the  need  to  spare  victims  and  witnesses  the  trauma  of  going  to  court  where  possible,  by  allowing  lighter  sentences  for  guilty  pleas  and  co-operation,  he  said.  |||    But  director  of  the  Victims  of  Crime  Trust,  Norman  Brennan,  accused  Lord  Woolf  of  having  an  ""arrogant  contempt  for  victims  of  crime  and  the  law-abiding  public"".  The  National  Association  of  Probation  Officers  said  the  move  would  be  ""political  suicide"".  In  revised  proposals  from  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  Council  (SGC),  the  section  on  murder  said  possible  reductions  would  have  to  be  ""weighed  carefully""  by  a  judge  so  they  did  not  lead  to  ""an  inappropriately  short  sentence"".  Where  it  was  appropriate  to  reduce  the  minimum  term  having  regard  to  a  plea  of  guilty,  the  maximum  reduction  would  be  one  sixth,  and  should  never  exceed  five  years,  it  said.  |||    In  a  statement  issued  on  Wednesday  Lord  Woolf  said:  ""I  have  no  doubt  that  being  able  to  call  on  the  diverse  backgrounds  and  experiences  of  all  those  that  serve  on  the  SGC  has  vastly  improved  the  final  guidelines.  ""I  am  confident,  as  a  result,  that  judges  will  be  better  placed  to  deliver  sentences  which  are  effective  both  as  punishments  and  deterrents  to  offending  and  reoffending.""  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions,  Ken  Macdonald  QC,  who  sits  on  the  SGC,  said  the  principle  of  discounting  sentences  to  offenders  for  early  guilty  pleas  is  set  down  by  parliament.  ""What  the  new  guideline  on  reduced  sentences  for  guilty  pleas  does  is  increase  the  chances  of  convicting  the  guilty  by  bringing  clarity  to  this  process.  ""It  represents  a  tougher  regime  than  existed  previously,  because  the  discount  is  automatically  reduced  if  a  guilty  plea  is  not  made  at  the  first  available  opportunity,""  he  said." 

0	"Takeover  offer  for  Sunderland  FC  |||    Bob  Murray,  chairman  of  Sunderland  FC,  has  launched  a  £1.5m  ($2.8m)  bid  for  the  club  after  buying  broadcaster  BSkyB's  stake  in  the  business.  |||    Mr  Murray  is  already  Sunderland's  leading  shareholder,  holding  a  37.6%  stake,  and  now  hopes  to  take  full  control  of  the  Championship  side.  Mr  Murray  said  the  club  would  find  it  easier  to  attract  more  investment  by  having  a  single  majority  owner.  Sunderland  delisted  its  shares  from  the  stock  market  in  August.  |||    A  lifetime  Sunderland  supporter  and  board  director  since  1984,  Mr  Murray  agreed  to  buy  BSkyB's  4.76%  holding  in  the  Wearside  club  on  Tuesday  -  taking  his  stake  to  42.3%.  Under  stock  market  rules,  Mr  Murray  is  required  to  make  an  offer  for  the  remaining  shares  that  he  does  not  already  own  at  the  same  price  paid  for  the  BSkyB  holding  of  31p  a  share.  |||    Should  the  offer  be  fully  accepted,  Mr  Murray  said  he  expected  to  pay  a  maximum  of  £1.53m  for  the  remaining  shares.  He  also  stressed  that  fans  who  wanted  to  keep  in  touch  with  the  club's  financial  affairs  could  retain  a  small  number  of  shares,  enabling  them  to  attend  annual  meetings.  ""The  football  sector  is  experiencing  significant  changes  and  uncertainty,""  Mr  Murray  said  in  a  statement.  ""The  recent  speculation  surrounding  Malcolm  Glazer  and  Manchester  United  has  shown  the  unsettling  effect  possible  where  there  are  a  number  of  disparate  interests,""  he  added.  ""I  believe  that  this  offer  will  strengthen  the  company  and  remove  the  potential  for  that  type  of  uncertainty.""  |||    Sunderland  were  relegated  from  the  Premiership  in  2003  but  are  currently  pushing  for  promotion.  The  club  managed  to  reduce  its  losses  last  year  from  £20.6m  to  £1.2m  after  selling  a  host  of  leading  players.  However,  the  club's  turnover  dropped  sharply  from  £42.5m  to  £28.5m  over  the  same  period,  because  of  a  fall  in  broadcast  revenues.  BSkyB  bought  its  stake  in  Sunderland  in  1999  as  part  of  a  five  year  media  partnership  deal.  The  deal  expired  last  month." 

2	"Child  access  laws  shake-up  |||    Parents  who  refuse  to  allow  former  partners  contact  with  their  children  could  be  electronically  tagged  under  plans  being  considered  by  ministers.  Curfews  and  community  service  orders  were  other  options  which  could  be  used  if  court  orders  to  allow  parental  access  were  defied,  Lord  Falconer  said.  The  constitutional  affairs  secretary  outlined  some  of  the  plans  on  Tuesday.  He  denied  fathers'  activists  had  forced  the  changes,  telling  the  BBC  ""there  is  a  recognition  that  something  is  wrong"".  Between  15,000  and  20,000  couples  go  to  court  to  resolve  access  disputes  each  year,  although  in  nine  out  of  10  separations  there  is  no  court  intervention.  |||    Lord  Falconer  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme  he  hoped  voluntary  mediation  could  help  solve  disputes  before  they  reached  court.  But  he  opposed  compulsory  mediation,  saying  that  it  would  lead  to  many  people  taking  part  with  the  wrong  attitude.  Other  plans  include:  |||        -  Parenting  plans  to  give  advice  on  access  arrangements,  based  on  real-life  examples  that  have  worked  in  the  past      -  Extending  in-court  conciliation  -  more  informal  hearings  before  contested  court  cases      -  Better  access  to  legal,  emotional  and  practical  advice  by  telephone  and  internet      -  Legal  aid  changes  to  give  incentives  for  early  resolution  of  disputes.        |||    Judges  can  already  jail  parents  who  breach  contact  orders  but  that  was  a  ""nuclear  option""  which  was  rarely  used  as  it  was  not  seen  as  being  in  the  child's  interests,  a  spokesman  said.  The  aim  of  the  new  legislation  was  to  provide  a  ""medium  range""  of  penalties,  such  as  fines,  community  service  orders,  compulsory  anger  management  or  parenting  classes  or  curfews.  |||    Failure  to  comply  with  these  measures  could  result  in  offenders  being  electronically  tagged.  On  the  possibility  of  tagging  uncooperative  parents,  Lord  Falconer  said:  ""Tagging  may  be  going  too  far,  but  let's  have  a  debate  about  that.""  Full  details  of  the  new  powers  will  not  be  revealed  until  a  bill  is  published  ""in  the  next  two  weeks,""  a  spokesman  said.  |||    The  government's  proposals  have  met  with  disapproval  from  fathers'  rights  groups.  John  Ison,  from  the  controversial  group  Fathers  4  Justice,  said:  ""It  is  very  disappointing.  What  we  have  got  is  a  cynical  case  of  recycling  existing  legislation.""  Jim  Parton,  from  Families  Need  Fathers,  said  the  new  proposals  ""lacked  compulsion"".  |||    ""We  would  like  to  see  couples  develop  a  plan  and  then  have  it  as  a  source  of  a  court  order  -  then  you  know  where  you  stand,  you  know  what  the  minimum  access  is.  ""Otherwise,  you  see  people  make  agreements  which  then  fall  apart.""  Mr  Parton  said  he  had  been  told  by  Children's  Minister  Margaret  Hodge  there  was  not  enough  time  to  pass  the  bill  through  parliament  before  the  general  election,  which  is  likely  to  take  place  in  May.  |||    The  Conservatives  have  called  for  an  equal  split  between  parents  on  access  to  be  made  law.  Theresa  May,  shadow  secretary  for  the  family,  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme  that  the  government's  plans  were  ""inadequate""  and  were  ""papering  over  the  cracks  of  the  current  system"".  She  said  a  Conservative  government  would  bring  a  ""radical  reform""  of  the  family  courts,  as  well  as  enforcing  a  ""legal  presumption  of  co-parenting  and  compulsory  mediation"".  ""We  want  to  make  courts  the  last  resort,  rather  than  the  first  resort,""  she  added.  The  government  says  children  cannot  simply  be  divided  up  ""like  property""  when  a  marriage  collapses.  The  Liberal  Democrats  have  argued  for  flexibility  in  deciding  access  rules,  rather  than  having  ""rigid  targets""." 

2	"Sainsbury's  Labour  election  gift  |||    Science  Minister  Lord  Sainsbury  has  made  a  £2m  donation  to  the  Labour  Party  for  its  General  Election  fund.  |||    It  is  the  latest  hefty  donation  to  the  party  by  the  billionaire  -  he  has  contributed  more  than  £10m  since  1999.  David  Sainsbury  said  he  was  pleased  to  give  cash  to  a  party  that  had  the  ""vision""  to  deliver  economic  prosperity  and  better  public  services  for  Britain.  General  Secretary  Matt  Carter  said  it  was  ""a  fantastic  gift""  that  would  help  Labour  ""fight  and  win  the  election"".  |||    ""Through  the  generosity  of  David  Sainsbury  and  other  Labour  supporters,  Labour  will  be  campaigning  hard  to  take  Britain  forward  and  to  stop  the  Tories  taking  us  back,""  Mr  Carter  said.  Lord  Sainsbury  added:  ""I  am  pleased  to  be  able  to  make  this  contribution  to  the  general  election  funds  of  the  Labour  Party  because  I  believe  that  they  are  the  only  party  that  has  the  vision  to  deliver  both  economic  prosperity  and  better  public  services  for  Britain.""  The  64-year-old  latest  donation  follows  a  £2.5m  gift  to  the  party  in  2003.  Lord  Sainsbury  was  created  a  life  peer  in  1997,  a  year  before  he  was  appointed  as  minister  for  science." 

3	"Thanou  bullish  over  drugs  hearing  |||    Katerina  Thanou  is  confident  she  and  fellow  sprinter  Kostas  Kenteris  will  not  be  punished  for  missing  drugs  tests  before  the  Athens  Olympics.  |||    The  Greek  pair  appeared  at  a  hearing  on  Saturday  which  will  determine  whether  their  provisional  bans  from  athletics'  ruling  body  the  IAAF  should  stand.  ""After  five  months  we  finally  had  the  chance  to  give  explanations.  I  am  confident  and  optimistic,""  said  Thanou.  ""We  presented  new  evidence  to  the  committee  that  they  were  not  aware  of.""  |||    The  athletes'  lawyer  Grigoris  Ioanidis  said  he  believed  the  independent  disciplinary  committee  set  up  by  the  Greek  Athletics  Federation  (SEGAS)  would  find  them  innocent.  ""We  are  almost  certain  that  the  charges  will  be  dropped,""  said  Ioanidis.  |||    ""We  believe  that  we  have  presented  [a  case]  that  the  charges  are  unreasonable.""  Thanou,  the  2000  Olympic  women's  100m  silver  medallist,  and  Sydney  200m  champion  Kenteris  were  suspended  by  the  IAAF  for  missing  three  drugs  tests.  The  third  was  supposed  to  take  place  on  the  eve  of  the  Athens  Games  last  August,  but  the  pair  could  not  be  found  in  the  athletes'  village.  They  were  later  taken  to  hospital  after  claiming  to  have  been  involved  in  a  motorcycle  accident.  Thanou's  coach  Christos  Tzekos  was  also  suspended  by  the  IAAF.  ""We  were  asked  [by  the  disciplinary  committee]  all  kinds  of  questions  about  the  night  of  12  August,""  said  Tzekos.  ""We  did  not  leave  any  gaps.  As  far  as  I  am  concerned  there  is  no  such  issue  [of  refusing  to  be  tested],  and  I  am  very  optimistic.""  Tzekos,  Thanou  and  Kenteris,  who  have  all  denied  the  charges,  can  expect  a  decision  within  a  month.  ""Deliberations  will  start  after  some  additional  documents  are  brought  in  by  Thursday,""  said  committee  chairman  Kostas  Panagopoulos.  ""I  estimate  that  the  final  ruling  will  be  issued  by  the  end  of  February.""" 

3	"Edwards  tips  Idowu  for  Euro  gold  |||    World  outdoor  triple  jump  record  holder  and  BBC  pundit  Jonathan  Edwards  believes  Phillips  Idowu  can  take  gold  at  the  European  Indoor  Championships.  |||    Idowu  landed  17.30m  at  the  British  trials  in  Sheffield  last  month  to  lead  the  world  triple  jump  rankings.  ""It's  all  down  to  him,  but  if  he  jumps  as  well  as  he  did  in  Sheffield  he  could  win  the  gold  medal,""  said  Edwards.  ""His  ability  is  undoubted  but  all  his  best  performances  seem  to  happen  in  domestic  meetings.""  |||    Idowu  made  his  breakthrough  five  years  ago  but  so  far  has  only  a  Commonwealth  silver  medal  to  his  name.  Edwards  himself  kept  Idowu  off  top  spot  at  the  Manchester  Games.  But  he  believes  the  European  Indoors  in  Madrid  represent  a  chance  for  the  26-year-old  to  prove  his  credentials  as  Britain's  top  triple  jumper.  ""He  has  to  start  producing  at  international  level  and  here  is  the  beginning,""  said  Edwards.  ""Phillips  still  needs  to  be  much  more  consistent.  I'm  sure  a  victory  in  Madrid  will  build  up  his  confidence  and  self-belief  that  he  can  be  best  in  the  world.""  The  qualifying  round  of  the  men's  triple  jump  in  Madrid  takes  place  on  Friday  with  the  final  scheduled  for  Saturday.  Olympic  champion  Christian  Olsson  will  not  be  taking  part  as  he  is  out  for  the  entire  indoor  season  with  an  ankle  injury." 

3	"Mido  makes  third  apology  |||    Ahmed  'Mido'  Hossam  has  made  another  apology  to  the  Egyptian  people  in  an  attempt  to  rejoin  the  national  team.  |||    The  21-year-old  told  a  news  conference  in  Cairo  on  Sunday  that  he  is  sorry  for  the  problems  that  have  led  to  his  exclusion  from  the  Pharaohs  since  July  last  year.  Mido  said:  ""There  isn't  much  I  have  to  say  today,  all  there  is  to  say  is  that  I  came  specially  from  England  to  Egypt  to  rejoin  the  national  team  and  to  apologise  for  all  my  mistakes.""  Mido  was  axed  by  former  coach  Marco  Tardelli  after  failing  to  answer  a  national  call-up,  claiming  he  had  a  groin  injury.  But  he  then  played  in  a  friendly  for  his  club  AS  Roma  within  24  hours  of  a  World  Cup  qualifying  match  at  home  to  Cameroon  last  September.  Mido  added:  ""It's  not  my  right  to  give  orders  and  say  when  I  want  to  play  ...  at  the  same  time  I  will  always  make  sure  that  I  put  the  national's  team's  matches  as  my  top  priority.  ""I  feel  that  the  national  players  are  playing  with  a  new  spirit  as  I  saw  them  play  against  Belgium  (Egypt  won  4-0  on  Wednesday)  and  I  simply  want  to  add  to  their  success.  ""I  do  confess  that  I  was  rude  to  the  Egyptian  press  at  times  but  now  I  have  gained  more  experience  and  know  that  I  will  never  go  anywhere  without  the  press's  support.  ""Many  of  the  international  stars  like  David  Beckham  and  (Zinedine)  Zidane  had  the  press  opposing  them.  ""So  I'm  now  used  to  the  fact  that  the  press  can  be  against  me  at  times  and  I  don't  have  to  overreact  when  this  happens.  Meanwhile,  Egypt  FA  spokesman  Methat  Shalaby  welcomed  the  apology  and  said  no  one  had  exerted  pressure  on  Mido  to  apologise.  ""Mido's  apology  today  does  not  negatively  affect  Mido  in  anyway,  on  the  contrary  it  makes  him  a  bigger  star  and  a  role  model  for  all  football  players,""  Shalaby  said.  Shalaby  earlier  said  that  after  an  apology  Mido  would  be  available  for  the  national  side  if  coach  Hassan  Shehata  chose  him.  Mido  joined  Tottenham  in  an  18-month  loan  deal  near  the  end  of  the  January  transfer  window,  scoring  twice  on  his  debut  against  Portsmouth."

The  former  teacher  confirmed  he  had  attended  the  meeting  but  said  that  was  the  only  contact  he  had  with  the  group.  Mr  Betts-Green  resigned  after  being  questioned  by  the  party's  leadership.  A  UKIP  spokesman  said  Mr  Betts-Green's  resignation  followed  disclosures  in  the  East  Anglian  Daily  Times  last  month  about  his  attendance  at  a  BNP  meeting.  ""He  did  once  attend  a  BNP  meeting.  He  did  not  like  what  he  saw  and  heard  and  will  take  no  further  part  of  it,""  the  spokesman  added.  A  meeting  of  Suffolk  Coastal  UKIP  members  is  due  to  be  held  next  week  to  discuss  a  replacement.

1	"US  box  office  set  for  record  high  |||    Ticket  sales  at  the  US  box  office  are  predicted  to  break  records  this  year,  with  figures  expected  to  reach  $9.4  billion,  beating  2002's  all-time  high.  |||    Overall  figures  could  be  dampened  by  the  lack  of  a  Christmas  hit  like  last  year's  Oscar-winning  Lord  of  the  Rings.  Traditionally,  ticket  sales  during  the  festive  season  account  for  20%  of  the  annual  total.  Although  admissions  have  actually  fallen  this  year,  the  predicted  high  is  down  to  increasing  ticket  prices.  According  to  Exhibitor  Relations  President  Paul  Dergarabedian,  the  average  cost  of  a  cinema  ticket  could  be  as  high  as  $6.25  in  2004,  compared  to  $5.80  in  2002.  This  year  some  of  the  biggest  hits  such  as  The  Passion  of  the  Christ  and  Fahrenheit  9/11  came  from  outside  the  major  studios  which  are  usually  responsible  for  the  key  blockbusters.  |||    ""Many  of  the  films  that  did  well  (with  audiences)  are  not  necessarily  the  films  that  made  a  lot  of  money,""  said  Mr  Dergarabedian.  He  added  that  surprise  hits  had  come  from  some  of  the  more  art-house  offerings  such  as  Napoleon  Dynamite  and  critical  hit  Sideways.  Sony  Pictures,  responsible  for  hits  like  Spiderman  2  and  The  Grudge,  are  expected  to  top  domestic  market  share  for  the  second  time  in  three  years,  with  $1  billion-plus  in  sales  for  the  third  consecutive  year.  Sony  Pictures  Entertainment  vice  chairman.  Jeff  Blake  said:  ""We  had  a  really  diverse  slate  this  year,  and...  certainly  we  pulled  off  one  of  the  surprises  with  Grudge.""  Horror  movie  The  Grudge  cost  Sony  $10  million  to  make  but  brought  in  $110  million.  It's  the  latest  in  a  recent  trend  for  Hollywood  studios  to  back  the  upper  and  lower  ends  of  the  market,  whilst  ignoring  the  middle.  Warner  Inc  are  likely  to  end  the  year  in  second  place  on  market  share  with  around  $1.25  billion,  with  Disney  at  number  three." 

1	"Original  Exorcist  to  be  screened  |||    The  original  version  of  horror  prequel  Exorcist:  The  Beginning,  dropped  by  producers  over  claims  it  was  not  scary  enough,  is  to  have  its  world  premiere.  |||    The  film,  directed  by  Paul  Schrader,  will  be  screened  on  18  March  at  the  International  Festival  of  Fantastic  Film  in  Brussels.  The  psychological  drama  stars  Stellan  Skarsgard  and  foreruns  the  1973  film.  Schrader  was  replaced  by  director  Renny  Harlin  who  made  a  new  version  of  the  film  which  debuted  in  2004.  The  prequel  project  was  originally  announced  in  2001,  with  actor  Liam  Neeson  in  the  lead  role  and  John  Frankenheimer  as  director.  However  Frankenheimer  pulled  out  in  2002,  a  month  before  he  died.  |||    Skarsgard  then  replaced  Neeson  in  the  role  of  Father  Merrin,  made  famous  by  Max  Von  Sydow  in  the  1973  film.  Principal  footage  was  shot  in  Morocco  and  Rome  at  a  reported  cost  of  $32m.  However,  in  August  2003  it  emerged  that  producers  Morgan  Creek  were  shelving  Schrader's  version  of  the  film,  having  complained  it  was  not  scary  enough.  As  well  as  replacing  Schrader  with  Harlin  -  the  director  behind  Die  Hard  2  and  Cliffhanger  -  the  producers  also  changed  most  of  the  cast,  but  Swedish  star  Skarsgard  stayed  in  the  Merrin  role.  Harlin's  film,  released  in  the  UK  in  October  2004,  received  lukewarm  reviews  but  went  on  to  make  over  $76m  (£40.7m)  worldwide.  The  festival  screening  will  be  the  first  time  that  Schrader's  film  has  been  seen  in  public.  Reports  that  it  will  be  released  either  in  cinemas  or  on  DVD  have  yet  to  be  confirmed.  Other  films  at  the  festival  in  the  Belgium  capital,  which  runs  from  11-26  March,  include  the  US  horror  hit  Boogeyman  and  the  forthcoming  sequel  Ring  2,  as  well  as  a  selection  of  films  adapted  from  the  works  of  Jules  Verne."

Increased  take-up  of  broadband  telecoms  services  also  boosted  France  Telecom's  profits,  which  showed  a  5.5%  rise  to  18.3bn  euros  ($23.4bn;  £12.5bn).  France  Telecom  is  to  spend  578m  euros  on  buying  out  minority  shareholders  in  data  services  provider  Equant.  |||    France  Telecom,  one  of  the  world's  largest  telecoms  and  internet  service  providers,  saw  its  full-year  sales  rise  2.2%  to  47.2bn  euros  in  2004.  |||    Orange  enjoyed  strong  growth  outside  France  and  the  United  Kingdom  -  its  core  markets  -  swelling  its  subscriber  base  to  5.4  million.  France  Telecom's  broadband  customers  also  increased,  rising  to  5.1  million  across  Europe  by  the  end  of  the  year.  The  firm  said  it  had  met  its  main  strategic  objectives  of  growing  its  individual  businesses  and  further  reducing  its  large  debt.  An  ill-fated  expansion  drive  in  the  late  1990s  saw  France  Telecom's  debt  soar  to  72bn  euros  by  2002.  However,  this  has  now  been  reduced  to  43.9bn  euros.  ""Our  results  for  2004  allow  us  to  improve  our  financial  structure  while  focusing  on  the  innovation  that  drives  our  strategy,""  said  chief  executive  Thierry  Breton.  |||    Looking  ahead,  the  company  forecast  like-for-like  sales  growth  of  between  3%  and  5%  over  the  next  three  years.  France  Telecom  is  consolidating  its  interest  in  Equant,  which  provides  telecoms  and  data  services  to  businesses.  Subject  to  approval  by  shareholders  of  the  two  firms,  it  will  buy  the  shares  in  Equant  it  does  not  already  own.  France  Telecom  said  it  would  fund  the  deal  by  selling  an  8%  stake  in  telephone  directory  company  PagesJaunes."

A  consortium  of  creditors  and  LG  Group,  a  family  owned  conglomerate,  have  each  put  up  $480m  to  stabilise  the  firm.  LG  Card  has  seven  million  customers  and  its  collapse  would  have  sent  shockwaves  through  the  country's  economy.  |||    The  firm's  creditors  -  which  own  99%  of  LG  Card  -  have  been  trying  to  agree  a  deal  to  secure  its  future  for  several  weeks.  They  took  control  of  the  company  in  January  when  it  avoided  bankruptcy  only  through  a  $4.5bn  bail-out.  |||    They  had  threatened  to  delist  the  company,  a  move  which  would  have  triggered  massive  debt  redemptions  and  forced  the  company  into  bankruptcy,  unless  agreement  was  reached  on  its  future  funding.  ""LG  Card  will  not  need  any  more  financial  aid  after  this,""  Laah  Chong-gyu,  executive  director  of  Korea  Development  Bank  -  one  of  the  firm's  creditors  -  said.  |||    The  agreement  will  see  some  12  trillion  won  of  debt  converted  into  equity.  ""The  purpose  of  the  capital  injection  is  to  avoid  delisting  and  the  goal  will  be  met,""  David  Kim,  an  analyst  at  Sejong  Securities,  told  Reuters.  South  Korea's  consumer  credit  market  has  been  slowly  recovering  from  a  crisis  in  2002  when  a  credit  bubble  burst  and  millions  of  consumers  fell  behind  on  their  debt  repayments.  LG  Card  returned  to  profit  in  September  but  needed  further  capital  to  avoid  being  thrown  off  the  market.  South  Korea's  stock  exchange  can  delist  any  firm  if  its  debt  exceeds  its  assets  two  years  running."

May  said:  ""Suddenly  the  Queen  Phoenix  is  rising  again  from  the  ashes  and  will  take  precedence  over...  our  lives.""  Queen  have  played  with  many  different  singers  since  Mercury's  death  in  1991  but  have  reportedly  not  toured.  May  performed  with  Rodgers  at  a  concert  to  celebrate  the  50th  anniversary  of  the  Fender  Stratocaster  guitar  in  London  in  September.  |||    ""We  were  both  so  amazed  at  the  chemistry  that  was  going  on  in  [Free  hit]  All  Right  Now,  that  suddenly  it  seems  blindingly  obvious  that  there  was  'something  happening  here,'""  May  wrote  on  his  website.  They  teamed  up  again  for  a  concert  to  mark  their  induction  into  the  UK  Music  Hall  of  Fame,  and  were  joined  by  Taylor.  ""The  show  went  so  incredibly  well  from  our  point  of  view,  and  we  got  so  many  rave  reactions  from  out  there,  we  decided  almost  then  and  there  that  we  would  look  at  a  tour  together,""  May  wrote.  |||    Queen  went  to  number  one  in  2000  with  a  version  of  We  Will  Rock  You  sung  by  boy  band  5ive  and  they  have  also  played  with  Robbie  Williams,  Will  Young  and  Bob  Geldof.  Queen  bassist  John  Deacon  has  currently  retired  from  the  stage.  Rodgers  was  singer  with  early  1970s  rockers  Free,  who  had  a  global  hit  with  All  Right  Now,  before  forming  Bad  Company,  a  successful  ""supergroup""  with  members  of  King  Crimson  and  Mott  the  Hoople.

0	"Beijingers  fume  over  parking  fees  |||    Choking  traffic  jams  in  Beijing  are  prompting  officials  to  look  at  reorganising  car  parking  charges.  |||    Car  ownership  has  risen  fast  in  recent  years,  and  there  are  now  two  and  a  half  million  cars  on  the  city's  roads.  The  trouble  is  that  the  high  status  of  car  ownership  is  matched  by  expensive  fees  at  indoor  car  parks,  making  motorists  reluctant  to  use  them.  Instead  roads  are  being  clogged  by  drivers  circling  in  search  of  a  cheaper  outdoor  option.  ""The  price  differences  between  indoor  and  outdoor  lots  are  unreasonable,""  said  Wang  Yan,  an  official  from  the  Beijing  Municipal  Commission  for  Development  and  Reform  quoted  in  the  state-run  China  Daily  newspaper.  Mr  Wang,  who  is  in  charge  of  collecting  car  parking  fees,  said  his  team  would  be  looking  at  adjusting  parking  prices  to  close  the  gap.  Indoor  parking  bays  can  cost  up  to  250%  more  than  outdoor  ones.  |||    Sports  fans  who  drive  to  matches  may  also  find  themselves  the  target  of  the  commission's  road  rage.  It  wants  them  to  use  public  transport,  and  is  considering  jacking  up  the  prices  of  car  parks  near  sports  grounds.  Mr  Wang  said  his  review  team  may  scrap  the  relatively  cheap  hourly  fee  near  such  places  and  impose  a  higher  flat  rate  during  matches.  Indoor  parking  may  be  costly,  but  it  is  not  always  secure.  Mr  Wang's  team  are  also  going  to  look  into  complaints  from  residents  about  poor  service  received  in  exchange  for  compulsory  monthly  fees  of  up  to  400  yuan  ($48;  £26).  The  Beijing  authorities  decided  two  years  ago  that  visiting  foreign  dignitaries'  motorcades  should  not  longer  get  motorcycle  outriders  as  they  blocked  the  traffic.  Unclogging  Beijing's  increasingly  impassable  streets  is  a  major  concern  for  the  Chinese  authorities,  who  are  building  dozens  of  new  roads  to  create  a  showcase  modern  city  ahead  of  the  2008  Olympic  Games." 

2	"'Best  person'  for  top  legal  job  |||    The  ""best  person  for  the  job""  should  be  appointed  lord  chancellor,  and  not  necessarily  a  lawyer  or  MP,  the  courts  minister  has  told  MPs.  |||    Under  reforms,  the  post  of  lord  chancellor  is  to  be  stripped  of  its  judicial  functions.  ""The  lord  chancellor...no  more  needs  to  be  a  lawyer  than  the  Secretary  of  Health  needs  to  be  a  doctor,""  said  courts  minister  Christopher  Leslie.  The  Constitutional  Reform  Bill  was  entering  its  second  reading  on  Monday.  Mr  Leslie  said:  ""The  prime  minister  should  be  able  to  appoint  the  best  person  for  the  job  whether  they  sit  in  the  House  of  Lords  or  the  House  of  Commons.""  Under  the  reforms,  the  Law  Lords  will  also  be  replaced  as  the  UK's  highest  legal  authority  by  a  Supreme  Court  and  judges  will  be  appointed  by  an  independent  panel  rather  than  ministers.  |||    In  December  the  Lords  rejected  a  plea  by  current  Lord  Chancellor  Lord  Falconer  that  the  holder  of  the  job  should  not  necessarily  be  a  lawyer  or  a  peer.  The  peers  voted  by  229  to  206  to  say  in  law  that  lord  chancellors  must  also  be  peers.  The  debate  was  carried  over  from  the  last  Parliamentary  session,  but  with  an  impending  general  election  time  is  crucial  for  the  government  to  get  the  Bill  passed.  Mr  Leslie  said  it  was  irrelevant  whether  the  post  was  called  Secretary  of  State  for  Constitutional  Affairs  or  Lord  Chancellor.  He  said:  ""What  matters  most  is...whether  it  is  reformed  so  that  the  post  holder  no  longer  has  those  conflicting  duties.  ""It  is  no  longer  appropriate  for  a  government  minister  to  have  such  unfettered  discretion  in  the  appointment  of  judges.""  |||    Shadow  attorney  general  Dominic  Grieve  criticised  the  government  on  its  plans  to  change  what  he  said  was  an  ""exceptional  institution,""  providing  a  ""champion  of  the  independence  of  the  judiciary"".  The  government  had  initially  proposed  to  take  this  institution  and  ""smash  it  to  pieces,""  Mr  Grieve  said.  Convention  should  be  ""nurtured  and  celebrated,""  but  the  government  distrusted  and  disliked  it  instead.  He  warned  that  unless  ministers  backed  down  over  the  lord  chancellor  remaining  a  member  of  the  House  of  Lords,  the  government  would  have  ""great  difficulty""  in  getting  the  Bill  through  Parliament.  Former  Cabinet  minister  Douglas  Hogg,  whose  father  and  grandfather  served  as  lord  chancellor,  said  the  Bill  was  ""largely  unnecessary,  bureaucratic  and  expensive"".  But  the  Tory  MP  for  Sleaford  and  North  Hykeham  admitted  the  lord  chancellor's  role  and  office  ""cannot  be  frozen  in  aspic""." 

2	"Crisis  'ahead  in  social  sciences'  |||    A  national  body  designed  to  tackle  skills  shortages  in  key  subjects  should  be  set  up,  a  committee  of  MPs  has  said.  |||    There  was  an  ""absolute  crisis""  in  the  recruitment  of  statisticians  and  other  social  science  experts,  the  Commons  science  and  technology  committee  added.  ""Major  problems""  are  expected  over  the  next  10  years  as  the  social  science  workforce  continues  to  age,  it  said.  The  committee  was  reporting  on  the  work,  strategy  and  spending  plans  of  the  Economic  Social  Research  Council.  |||    The  council  aims  to  promote  and  support  strategic  research  for  social  science  postgraduates  and  provide  social  scientists  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  country.  It  also  liaises  with  the  government  and  industry  over  their  social  science  needs.  In  its  report  on  the  council's  work  the  committee  said:  ""We  are  deeply  concerned  by  the  skills  shortages  afflicting,  in  particular,  the  qualitative  branches  of  social  sciences.  This  mirrored  previous  concerns  the  committee  had  expressed  on  shortages  in  the  fields  of  maths  and  chemistry,  it  said.  ""It  is  hard  to  see  how  significant  progress  towards  rectifying  these  shortages  can  be  made  through  the  deployment  of  Economic  and  Social  Research  Council's  limited  resources.  ""If  the  government  is  serious  about  addressing  skills  shortages  in  key  subjects  it  needs  to  find  a  more  effective  mechanism  to  achieve  this.""  A  national  ""strategic  capabilities  fund""  to  address  shortages  in  key  areas  should  be  set  up  in  response,  the  committee  added."

Yukos  says  the  sale  was  illegal  and  is  pursuing  damages  in  a  US  court.  Its  lawyers  now  accept  ABN  Amro,  BNP  Paribas,  Calyon,  JP  Morgan  Chase  Bank,  and  Dresdner  Kleinwort  Wasserstein  were  not  involved  in  the  sale  financing.  However,  Yukos  still  has  an  outstanding  complaint  against  Deutsche  Bank,  which  it  alleges  to  be  the  leader  of  a  consortium  that  was  behind  a  bid  for  Yugansk  by  state  gas  monopoly  Gazprom.  The  company  has  also  accused  Gazprom,  the  Russian  Federation  and  two  other  Russian  firms.  |||    Gazprom  had  been  expected  to  win  the  December  auction,  but  ended  up  not  bidding.  Yugansk  was  sold  to  a  little-known  shell  company,  which  in  turn  was  bought  by  Rosneft.  Yukos  claims  its  downfall  was  punishment  for  the  political  ambitions  of  its  founder  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky.  The  firm,  whose  finance  chief  is  now  based  in  the  US,  filed  for  bankruptcy  in  Houston,  Texas,  and  sought  a  court  injunction  against  the  sale.  But  Deutsche  Bank  has  suggested  Yukos  artificially  manufactured  a  legal  case  to  stop  the  sale  of  its  main  asset.  A  hearing  scheduled  for  February  16  and  17  will  rule  on  whether  the  US  court  has  jurisdiction  in  the  case."

However,  a  slower-than-expected  fourth  quarter  points  to  more  modest  growth  for  the  trade-driven  economy  in  2005  as  global  technology  demand  falls  back.  Slowdowns  in  the  US  and  China  could  hit  electronics  exports,  while  the  tsunami  disaster  may  effect  the  service  sector.  |||    Economic  growth  is  set  to  halve  in  Singapore  this  year  to  between  3%  and  5%.  In  the  fourth  quarter,  the  city  state's  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  rose  at  an  annual  rate  of  2.4%.  That  was  up  from  the  third  quarter,  when  it  fell  3.0%,  but  was  well  below  analyst  forecasts.  ""I  am  surprised  at  the  weak  fourth  quarter  number.  The  main  drag  came  from  electronics,""  said  Lian  Chia  Liang,  economist  at  JP  Morgan  Chase.  Singapore's  economy  had  contracted  over  the  summer,  weighed  down  by  soaring  oil  prices.  The  economy's  poor  performance  in  the  July  to  September  period  followed  four  consecutive  quarters  of  double-digit  growth  as  Singapore  bounced  back  strongly  from  the  effects  of  the  deadly  Sars  virus  in  2003." 

0	"Palestinian  economy  in  decline  |||    Despite  a  short-lived  increase  in  Palestinian  jobs  in  2003,  the  economy  is  performing  well  below  its  potential,  said  a  World  Bank  report.  |||    Unemployment  stood  at  25%,  compared  with  10%  before  the  uprising  against  Israeli  occupation  four  years  ago.  Young  people  are  particularly  hard  hit  with  37%  out  of  work,  compared  with  14%  four  years  ago.  But  104,000  new  jobs  were  created  last  year  during  a  brief  easing  of  violence  and  closures.  However,  during  the  first  half  of  this  year,  the  Palestinian  economy  lost  more  than  22,000  jobs.  Last  year's  growth  rate  of  6%  can  also  be  attributed  to  this  temporary  gap  in  violence,  the  report  said.  According  to  the  report,  Intifada,  Closures  and  Palestinian  Economic  Crisis:  An  Assessment,  there  is  a  close  link  between  the  number  of  closures  -  both  border  closures  and  internal  closures  between  cities  -  and  Palestinian  economic  problems.  The  closures  arranged  by  Israel  restrict  the  movement  of  Palestinian  people  and  goods,  slowing  down  trade.  |||    ""Closures  are  a  key  factor  behind  today's  economic  crisis  in  the  West  Bank,""  said  Nigel  Roberts,  World  Bank  country  director  for  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza.  Nearly  half  of  all  Palestinians  -  some  47%  -  live  below  the  poverty  line  and  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  economic  shocks.  The  report  said  even  more  would  be  on  the  poverty  line  without  an  average  of  $950m  a  year  from  international  donors,  some  of  which  goes  towards  job  creation.  It  also  called  on  the  Palestinian  Authority  to  revive  its  reform  programme  and  maintain  financial  discipline  to  create  an  investment-friendly  climate.  This  week  Colin  Powell,  US  Secretary  of  State  was  visiting  the  West  Bank  to  stress  US  support  for  a  smooth  Palestinian  election  in  January."

""Too  few  companies  are  responding  proactively  to  the  social  and  business  threats,""  said  Dr  Kate  Taylor,  head  of  the  WEF's  global  Health  Initiative.  Nearly  9,000  business  leaders  in  104  countries  were  surveyed  for  Business  and  HIV/AIDS:  Commitment  and  Action?  |||    Dr  Taylor  described  the  level  of  action  taken  by  businesses  as  revealed  by  the  report  as  ""too  little,  too  late"".  The  issue  will  be  highlighted  to  business  and  world  leaders  at  the  World  Economic  Forum,  which  meets  in  Davos,  Switzerland,  next  week.  The  WEF  report  shows  that  despite  the  fact  that  14,000  people  contract  HIV/Aids  every  day,  concern  among  businesses  has  dropped  by  23%  in  the  last  12  months.  Most  (71%)  have  no  policies  in  place  to  address  the  disease.  Nor  could  over  65%  of  the  business  leaders  surveyed  say  or  estimate  the  prevalence  of  HIV  among  their  staff.  The  UN  programme  tackling  Aids,  UNAIDS,  pointed  out  that  having  a  clear  strategy  for  dealing  with  HIV/Aids  was  a  good  investment  as  well  as  being  socially  responsible.  |||    One  company  that  does  have  a  plan  is  Anglo-American,  the  international  mining  company,  which  estimates  an  HIV  prevalence  of  24%  among  its  130,000-strong  Southern  African  workforce.  |||    Over  the  last  two  years  the  company  has  implemented  extensive  voluntary  counselling  and  testing  for  HIV  infection,  coupled  with  anti-retroviral  therapy  for  employees  progressing  to  Aids.  Over  90%  of  the  2,200  employees  who  have  accessed  and  remained  on  treatment  are  well  and  have  returned  to  normal  work.  ""Effective  action  on  HIV/Aids  is  synonymous  with  good  business  management  and  leads  to  more  profitable  and  sustainable  operations,""  said  Brian  Brink,  senior  vice-president,  health,  at  Anglo-American.  |||    ""Companies  should  encourage  all  workers  to  know  their  HIV  status,  making  it  as  routine  as  monitoring  blood  pressure  or  cholesterol,""  he  said.  ""Providing  access  to  treatment  is  a  critical  part  of  this.""  Across  sub-Saharan  Africa,  even  in  countries  with  an  HIV  prevalence  of  10-19%,  only  around  7%  of  companies  have  formal  HIV/Aids  policies  in  place,  according  to  the  report.  The  gap  is  even  wider  in  China,  Ethiopia,  India,  Nigeria  and  Russia,  the  so-called  ""next  wave""  countries,  which  are  predicted  to  experience  the  highest  numbers  of  new  HIV/Aids  cases  worldwide  by  2010.  The  report  adds  ""an  important  building  block  to  our  understanding  of  how  the  business  community  is  experiencing  the  HIV/Aids  epidemic  and  to  whether  and  how  it  is  reacting,""  said  David  Bloom,  professor  of  economics  and  demography  at  the  Harvard  School  of  Public  Health.  |||    The  WEF  report  concludes  that  businesses  need  to  understand  their  exposure  to  HIV/Aids  risks  and  come  up  with  good  local  practices  to  manage  them.  A  key  priority,  in  both  high  and  low-prevalence  settings,  said  the  WEF  is  to  establish  a  policy  based  on  non-discrimination  and  confidentiality."

Blues  boss  Jose  Mourinho  was  sent  off  for  taunting  Liverpool  fans  after  the  goal  and  he  watched  on  television  as  his  side  went  on  to  win  the  game.  Drogba  and  Kezman  scored  from  close  range  before  Antonio  Nunez's  header  made  for  a  tense  finale.  It  was  an  amazing  climax  which  gave  Mourinho  his  first  silverware  as  Chelsea  manager.  Yet  it  was  controversial  too,  after  Mourinho's  sending  off,  apparently  for  putting  his  finger  to  his  lips  to  hush  the  Liverpool  fans.  There  was  no  hushing  them  after  the  extraordinary  opening  in  which  the  Reds  took  a  stunning  lead  inside  the  first  minute.  |||    Riise  could  not  have  connected  any  better  with  Morientes'  cross  as  he  smashed  a  left-foot  volley  past  Petr  Cech.  The  goal,  the  quickest-ever  in  a  League  Cup  final,  stunned  a  Blues  side  whose  previously  rock-solid  confidence  had  been  shaken  by  consecutive  losses  to  Newcastle  and  Barcelona  in  the  previous  week.  The  Blues'  attacking  chances  were  limited,  and  Jerzy  Dudek  was  equal  to  Frank  Lampard's  powerfully-struck  drive  and  Drogba's  low  shot.  Despite  their  frustration,  Chelsea  began  to  dominate  midfield  without  seriously  threatening  to  break  Liverpool's  well-organised  defence.  |||    Joe  Cole  had  a  shot  blocked  and  a  promising  Damien  Duff  break  was  halted  by  a  good  tackle  from  Djimi  Traore,  but  the  Reds  reached  half-time  without  any  major  scares.  The  Blues  began  the  second  half  with  more  urgency  and  pegged  Liverpool  back.  Nevertheless,  Liverpool  were  living  dangerously  and  they  needed  a  fantastic  double  save  from  Dudek  on  54  minutes,  first  at  full  stretch  from  Gudjohnsen's  header,  then  to  smother  William  Gallas'  follow-up.  And  despite  Chelsea's  possession,  it  was  Liverpool  who  fashioned  the  next  clear  opportunity  as  Luis  Garcia  fed  Dietmar  Hamann  whose  shot  forced  a  superb  save  from  Cech.  And  the  Blues'  increasingly  adventurous  approach  saw  Liverpool  earn  another  chance  on  the  break  on  75  minutes  as  Paulo  Ferreira  denied  Gerrard  with  a  last-ditch  tackle.  But  Gerrard  was  on  the  scoresheet  minutes  later  -  in  the  most  unfortunate  fashion  -  as  he  inadvertently  deflected  Ferrerira's  free-kick  past  his  own  keeper  and  in  off  the  post  to  bring  Chelsea  level.  That  prompted  Mourinho's  reaction  which  saw  him  sent  off,  but  Chelsea  still  pressed  and  Duff  had  a  chance  to  win  the  game  with  seven  minutes  remaining.  Dudek  saved  bravely  at  the  Irishman's  feet,  while  Milan  Baros  shot  wildly  at  the  other  end  to  ensure  extra  time.  Drogba  almost  headed  Chelsea  in  front  two  minutes  into  extra-time  but  the  striker  saw  the  ball  rebound  off  the  post.  But  seconds  after  the  half-time  interval,  Drogba  made  no  mistake,  picking  the  ball  up  from  Glen  Johnson's  long  throw  inside  the  six-yard  box  and  sidefooting  home.  And  Kezman  appeared  to  have  made  the  game  safe  as  he  netted  from  close  range  after  Gudjohnsen's  cross  in  the  110th  minute.  There  was  still  drama  as  Nunez  beat  Cech  to  a  high  ball  with  six  minutes  remaining  to  head  his  side  level,  but  despite  Liverpool's  desperate  attacks,  Chelsea  clung  on  to  win.  |||    Dudek,  Finnan,  Carragher,  Hyypia,  Traore  (Biscan  67),  Luis  Garcia,  Gerrard,  Hamann,  Riise,  Kewell  (Nunez  56),  Morientes  (Baros  74).  |||    Subs  Not  Used:  Pellegrino,  Carson.  |||    Hyypia,  Traore,  Hamann,  Carragher.  |||    Riise  1,  Nunez  113.  |||    Cech,  Paulo  Ferreira,  Ricardo  Carvalho,  Terry,  Gallas  (Kezman  74),  Jarosik  (Gudjohnsen  45),  Lampard,  Makelele,  Cole  (Johnson  81),  Drogba,  Duff.  |||    Subs  Not  Used:  Pidgeley,  Tiago.  |||    Lampard,  Kezman,  Drogba,  Duff.  |||    Gerrard  79  og,  Drogba  107,  Kezman  112.  |||    78,000  |||    S  Bennett  (Kent)."

The  four  companies  named  in  the  law  suit  are  gas  giant  Gazprom,  its  unit  Gazpromneft,  investment  company  Baikal,  and  state  oil  firm  Rosneft.  Yukos  submitted  the  suit  in  Houston,  where  it  filed  for  bankruptcy.  As  well  as  suing  for  damages,  Yukos  has  asked  the  US  court  to  send  its  tax  dispute  with  the  Russian  government  to  an  international  arbitrator.  It  also  has  submitted  a  reorganisation  plan  as  part  of  its  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  filing.  |||    The  clash  between  Yukos  and  the  Kremlin  came  to  a  head  last  year  when  Yukos  was  hit  with  a  bill  of  more  than  $27bn  in  back  taxes  and  unpaid  fines.  To  settle  the  bill,  Russia  forced  Yukos  to  sell  off  Yuganskneftegas.  |||    Yukos  called  the  sale  illegal  and  has  turned  to  courts  in  the  US  in  an  effort  to  regain  control  of  the  oil  production  business.  It  also  has  vowed  to  use  all  legal  means  at  its  disposal  to  go  after  any  firm  that  tries  to  buy  or  take  control  of  its  assets.  Earlier  this  month  it  sued  the  Russian  government  for  $28.3bn.  Analysts  have  questioned  whether  a  US  court  has  any  jurisdiction  over  Russian  companies,  while  Moscow  officials  have  dismissed  Yukos'  legal  wrangling  as  meaningless.  In  Houston,  bankruptcy  Judge  Letitia  Clark  will  start  a  two-day  hearing  on  16  February  to  hear  arguments  on  whether  a  US  court  is  the  proper  forum  for  the  case.  |||    The  threat  of  legal  action  from  Yukos  and  its  bankruptcy  filing  in  Houston  did  have  an  effect  on  last  year's  auction,  however.  Concerned  that  it  would  be  caught  up  in  a  court  battle,  Gazprom  and  Gazpromneft  withdrew  from  the  auction,  and  Yuganskneftegas  was  sold  to  little-known  investment  firm  Baikal  Finance  Group.  A  few  days  later,  Baikal  gave  control  of  the  company  to  state-run  oil  group  Rosneft  for  $9.3bn.  Rosneft,  meanwhile,  has  agreed  to  merge  with  Gazprom,  bringing  a  large  chunk  of  Russia's  very  profitable  oil  business  back  under  state  control.  Yukos  claims  that  the  rights  of  its  shareholders  have  been  ignored  and  that  is  has  been  punished  for  the  political  ambitions  of  its  founder  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky.  Mr  Khodorkovsky,  once  Russia's  richest  man,  is  in  prison,  having  been  charged  with  fraud  and  tax  evasion  and  repeatedly  denied  bail." 

2	"Will  Tory  tax  cuts  lift  spirits?  |||    Michael  Howard  has  finally  revealed  the  full  scale  of  his  planned  Tory  tax  cuts.  |||    Should  he  win  the  next  general  election,  he  has  earmarked  £4  billion  that  will  be  used  to  reduce  taxes  -  although  he  still  will  not  say  which  or  how.  This  was  the  pre-election  message  many  in  his  party  have  been  pressing  for  and  voters,  he  believes,  will  warm  to.  At  its  simplest,  it  is  saying:  ""Vote  Tory  and  you  can  have  it  both  ways"".  Not  only  would  his  government  stick  to  Labour  spending  plans  on  core  public  services,  including  health  and  education,  it  would  increase  spending  on  defence,  police  and  pensions.  And  even  after  that  was  done,  it  would  still  have  enough  left  over  for  a  tax  cut  equivalent  to  about  a  penny  off  the  basic  rate  of  income  tax.  |||    All  the  money  would  come  from  its  £35  billion  efficiency  savings  which  would  see  the  axe  taken  to  bureaucracy,  waste  and  the  civil  service.  Of  that,  £23  billion  would  go  on  spending  plans,  with  £8  billion  to  fill  the  black  hole  left,  they  claim,  by  Gordon  Brown,  and  the  rest  going  in  tax  cuts.  |||    Neither  Mr  Howard  nor  Mr  Letwin  would  say  exactly  how  they  would  use  that  cash,  although  a  cut  in  the  basic  rate  seems  unlikely.  Ideas  already  floated  include  raising  tax  thresholds  and  abolishing  or  reducing  inheritance  tax,  although  some  in  the  Tory  party  are  urging  Mr  Howard  to  announce  something  more  eye-catching  before  the  election.  As  the  Tory  leader  declared,  the  aim  of  the  exercise  is  to  open  up  a  real  economic  policy  divide  between  Labour  and  the  Tories.  ""At  this  election,  people  will  have  a  clear  choice  between  Mr  Blair  who  will  waste  more  and  tax  more  and  the  Conservative  party  which  will  give  value  for  money  and  tax  less,""  he  said.  |||    It  is  a  move  back  towards  an  almost  traditional  Tory  message  which  previously  suggested  Labour  was  the  party  of  tax  rises  and  the  Conservatives  the  party  of  tax  cuts.  |||    The  extension  of  that,  however,  was  that  Labour  was  also  seen  as  the  party  of  big  spending  on  the  public  services  while  the  Tories  were  the  cutters.  And  that  is  where  one  of  the  problems  lies  for  Mr  Howard  -  can  he  persuade  sceptical  voters  that  they  really  can  have  it  both  ways  with  bigger  spending  on  public  services  AND  lower  taxes?  He  insists  he  will  not  promise  anything  before  the  election  that  he  cannot  deliver  if  put  into  Downing  Street.  Labour,  needless  to  say,  claim  his  planned  £35bn  efficiency  savings  simply  don't  add  up  and  that  those  sorts  of  figures  are  fantasy.  |||    One  of  New  Labour's  greatest  successes  before  the  historic  1997  election  was  to  persuade  voters,  business  and  the  City  that  it  could  be  trusted  to  run  the  economy.  So  far  that  has  not  faced  any  real  challenge,  but  independent  analysts  now  claim  a  third  New  Labour  government  would  be  forced  to  either  increase  taxation  or  taxes  to  plug  a  black  hole  it  has  at  the  centre  of  its  finances.  Meanwhile,  the  Liberal  Democrats  are  committed  to  increasing  taxes  for  the  most  well  off  to  finance  their  spending  proposals  launched  earlier  in  the  day.  So,  Mr  Howard  hopes  his  message  will  start  to  hit  home  during  this  unofficial  election  campaign  and  that  his  poll  ratings  might  finally  lift  off  the  floor.  And,  while  other  issues  like  the  Iraq  war  and  trust  will  play  a  major  part  in  that  campaign,  it  is  likely  -  and  the  prime  minister  probably  hopes  -  that  the  economy  will  be  the  deciding  factor."

More  than  240  civil  and  military  aerospace  firms  from  31  countries  are  attending  the  show.  Analysts  said  India  could  spend  up  to  $35bn  (£18.8bn)  in  the  aviation  market  over  the  next  20  years.  Giants  such  Boeing  and  Airbus  -  on  the  civil  aviation  front  -  as  well  as  Lockheed  Martin  and  France's  Snecma  -  on  the  military  side  -  are  some  of  the  firms  attending  the  show.  ""There  is  tremendous  scope  for  outsourcing  from  India  in  areas  where  the  companies  are  competitive,""  said  Mr  Mukerjee.  ""We  are  keen  to  welcome  international  collaborations  that  are  in  conformity  with  our  national  goals.""  |||    Lockheed  said  it  had  signed  an  agreement  with  state-owned  Hindustan  Aeronautics  (HAL)  to  share  information  on  the  P-3  Orion  maritime  surveillance  aircraft.  |||    In  fact,  the  Indian  Armed  Force  is  considering  the  buying  of  used  P-3  Orion  as  well  as  F-16  fighter  jets  from  Lockheed.  The  US  military  industry  has  show  a  strong  interest  to  open  a  link  with  India,  now  that  relations  between  the  two  countries  have  improved  a  lot.  In  fact,  it  is  the  first  time  the  US  Air  Force  will  attend  the  air  show  since  sanctions  imposed  in  1998  after  India's  nuclear  tests  were  lifted.  But  the  Indian  Air  Force  is  also  considering  proposals  from  other  foreign  firms  such  as  France's  Dassault  Aviation,  Sweden's  Saab  and  Russia's  Mikoyan-Gurevich.  Meanwhile,  France's  Snecma  has  also  said  it  plans  a  joint  venture  with  HAL  to  make  engine  parts,  with  an  initial  investment  of  $6.5m.  |||    On  the  civilian  front,  Boeing  announced  a  deal  with  India's  HCL  Technologies  to  develop  a  platform  for  the  flight  test  system  of  its  787  Dreamliner  aircraft.  The  US  company  also  said  it  had  agreed  with  a  new  Indian  budget  airline  the  sale  of  10  737-800  planes  for  $630m.  The  airline,  SpiceJet,  will  also  have  the  option  to  acquire  10  more  aircraft.  Airbus  has  also  recently  signed  fresh  deals  with  two  Indian  airlines  -  Air  Deccan  and  Kingfisher.  In  addition,  the  European  company  has  plans  to  open  a  training  centre  in  India.  Meanwhile,  flag  carrier  Air  India  is  considering  to  buy  50  new  aircraft  from  either  Boeing  or  Airbus.  ""No  other  market  is  going  to  see  the  growth  that  will  be  seen  here  in  the  coming  years,""  said  Dinesh  Keskar,  senior  vice  president  Boeing." 

2	"Student  'inequality'  exposed  |||    Teenagers  from  well-off  backgrounds  are  six  times  more  likely  to  go  to  university  than  those  from  the  most  deprived  areas,  a  report  says.  |||    The  Higher  Education  Funding  Council  for  England  said  more  people  went  to  university  between  1994  and  2000.  But  the  percentage  of  poorer  students  ""hardly  changed  at  all"",  said  its  chief  executive,  Sir  Howard  Newby.  Increasingly  more  women  than  men  went  to  university,  while  tuition  fees  and  student  loans  made  no  major  difference.  |||    The  Hefce  report,  drawing  on  child  benefits  data,  said  teenagers  in  the  richest  areas  could  expect  a  better  than  50%  chance  of  going  to  university,  while  in  the  poorest  neighbourhoods  it  was  10%.  Participation  at  constituency  level  ranged  from  69%  in  Kensington  and  Chelsea,  65%  in  the  City  of  London  and  Westminster  and  62%  in  Sheffield  Hallam,  down  to  10%  in  Bristol  South  and  Leeds  Central  and  8%  in  Nottingham  North  and  Sheffield  Brightside.  |||    Sir  Howard  said  the  report  highlighted  the  ""entrenched  divisions""  between  rich  and  poor  areas,  but  added  it  was  a  social  as  much  as  an  educational  problem.  He  told  BBC  News:  ""We  know,  once  children  from  deprived  backgrounds  get  into  university,  they  do  very  well.  In  fact  surprisingly  more  go  into  postgraduate  study  than  those  from  more  affluent  backgrounds.  ""The  issue  is,  I  think,  one  of  raising  aspirations  amongst  those  families  and  those  communities  that  university  is  something  for  them  and  not  for  other  people.""  |||    He  said  by  the  time  universities  traditionally  dealt  with  pupils,  between  the  ages  of  16  and  18,  it  was  too  late.  Instead  they  should  be  reaching  out  to  communities  and  schools  much  earlier,  even  down  to  primary  school  level,  to  persuade  them  a  university  education  was  something  they  could  aspire  to,  he  said.  But  while  the  report  revealed  stark  inequalities  and  exposed  the  extent  of  the  challenge,  there  were  some  encouraging  findings,  he  added.  |||    Tuition  fees  and  student  loans  in  England  and  Wales  -  and  the  different  fee  regime  in  Scotland  -  did  not  seem  to  have  affected  the  choices  of  young  people,  even  the  poorest.  The  report  also  showed  women  were  18%  more  likely  than  men  to  enter  higher  education  in  2000  -  up  from  6%  in  1994.  In  the  poorest  areas,  the  gap  was  30%  in  women's  favour  and  growing  faster  than  anywhere  else.  The  Higher  Education  Minister,  Kim  Howells,  said:  ""We  are  working  in  schools  to  raise  the  attainment  and  aspiration  of  young  people  in  disadvantaged  areas.""  Higher  standards  in  schools  would  lead  to  greater  participation  in  higher  education.  From  2006  upfront  tuition  fees  in  England  would  be  removed,  with  grants  for  the  less  well  off.  The  shadow  education  secretary,  Tim  Collins,  said:  ""It  is  clear  from  this  report  that  children  from  disadvantaged  areas  are  far  more  likely  to  have  encountered  poor  standards  in  their  secondary  education.  ""Tackling  these  must  be  the  top  priority  for  any  government  looking  to  improve  university  access.""  The  group  which  represents  university  vice-chancellors,  Universities  UK,  said  the  new  system  of  deferred  fees  in  England,  due  to  start  in  2006,  with  grants  and  bursaries  for  poorer  students,  would  encourage  more  of  them  to  go  into  higher  education.  The  National  Union  of  Students  argued  the  opposite  -  that  the  situation  was  ""likely  to  get  much  worse,  with  poorer  students  being  restricted  in  choice  and  having  to  make  decisions  based  on  their  financial  situation  rather  than  aspiration"".  |||    The  tables  below  show  the  participation  rate  for  each  Parliamentary  constituency  in  Britain:" 

0	"GM  in  crunch  talks  on  Fiat  future  |||    Fiat  will  meet  car  giant  General  Motors  (GM)  on  Tuesday  in  an  attempt  to  reach  agreement  over  the  future  of  the  Italian  firm's  loss-making  auto  group.  |||    Fiat  claims  that  GM  is  legally  obliged  to  buy  the  90%  of  the  car  unit  it  does  not  already  own;  GM  says  the  contract,  signed  in  2000,  is  no  longer  valid.  Press  reports  have  speculated  that  Fiat  may  be  willing  to  accept  a  cash  payment  in  return  for  dropping  its  claim.  Both  companies  want  to  cut  costs  as  the  car  industry  adjusts  to  waning  demand.  |||    The  meeting  between  Fiat  boss  Sergio  Marchionne  and  GM's  Rick  Wagoner  is  due  to  take  place  at  1330  GMT  in  Zurich,  according  to  the  Reuters  news  agency.  |||    Mr  Marchionne  is  confident  of  his  firm's  legal  position,  saying  in  an  interview  with  the  Financial  Times  that  GM's  argument  ""has  no  legs"".  The  agreement  in  question  dates  back  to  GM's  decision  to  buy  20%  of  Fiat's  auto  division  in  2000.  At  the  time,  it  gave  the  Italian  firm  the  right,  via  a  'put  option',  to  sell  the  remaining  stake  to  GM.  In  recent  weeks,  Fiat  has  reiterated  its  claims  that  this  'put'  is  still  valid  and  legally  binding.  However,  GM  argues  that  a  Fiat  share  sale  made  last  year,  which  cut  GM's  holding  to  10%,  together  with  asset  sales  made  by  Fiat  have  terminated  the  agreement.  |||    Selling  the  Fiat's  car-making  unit  may  not  prove  so  simple,  analysts  say,  especially  as  it  is  a  company  that  is  so  closely  linked  to  Italy's  industrial  heritage.  Political  and  public  pressure  may  well  push  the  two  firms  to  reach  a  compromise.  ""We  are  not  expecting  Fiat  to  exercise  its  put  of  the  auto  business  against  an  unwilling  GM  at  this  point,""  brokerage  Merrill  Lynch  said  in  a  note  to  investors,  adding  that  any  legal  battle  would  be  protracted  and  damaging  to  the  business.  ""As  far  as  we  are  aware,  the  Agnelli  family,  which  indirectly  controls  at  least  30%  of  Fiat,  has  not  given  a  firm  public  indication  that  it  wants  to  sell  the  auto  business.  ""Fiat  may  be  willing  to  cancel  the  'put'  in  exchange  for  money.""" 

2	"'Debate  needed'  on  donations  cap  |||    A  cap  on  donations  to  political  parties  should  not  be  introduced  yet,  the  elections  watchdog  has  said.  |||    Fears  that  big  donors  can  buy  political  favours  have  sparked  calls  for  a  limit.  In  a  new  report,  the  Electoral  Commission  says  it  is  worth  debating  a  £10,000  cap  for  the  future  but  now  is  not  the  right  time  to  introduce  it.  It  also  says  there  should  be  more  state  funding  for  political  parties  and  candidates  should  be  able  to  spend  more  on  election  campaigning.  |||    There  were  almost  £68m  in  reported  donations  to  political  parties  in  2001,  2002  and  2003,  with  nearly  £12m  of  them  from  individual  gifts  worth  more  than  £1m.  The  rules  have  already  been  changed  so  the  public  can  see  who  gives  how  much  to  the  parties  but  the  report  says  there  are  still  public  suspicions.  The  commission  says  capping  donations  would  mean  taxpayers  giving  parties  more  cash  -  something  which  would  first  have  to  be  acceptable  to  the  public  and  shown  to  work.  ""While  we  are  not  in  principle  opposed  to  the  introduction  of  a  donation  cap,  we  do  not  believe  that  such  a  major  departure  from  the  existing  system  now  would  be  sensible,""  says  its  report.  If  there  was  to  be  a  cap,  it  should  be  £10,000  -  a  small  enough  amount  to  make  a  difference  but  which  would  have  banned  £56m  in  donations  between  2001  and  2003.  |||    Even  without  changes  the  commission  does  urge  political  parties  to  seek  out  more  small-scale  donations  and  suggests  there  should  be  income  tax  relief  for  gifts  under  £200.  It  also  suggests  increasing  state  funding  for  parties  to  £3m  so  help  can  be  extended  to  all  parties  with  at  least  two  members  in  the  House  of  Commons,  European  Parliament,  Scottish  Parliament,  Welsh  Assembly  or  Northern  Ireland  Assembly.  And  it  suggests  new  ways  of  boosting  election  campaigning,  seen  as  a  way  of  improving  voter  turnout.  All  local  election  candidates  should  be  entitled  to  a  free  mailshot  for  campaign  leaflets,  says  the  watchdog.  And  there  should  be  a  shift  in  the  amount  of  money  allowed  to  be  spent  at  elections  from  a  national  level  to  a  local  level  to  help  politicians  engage  better  with  voters.  |||    The  report  suggests  doubling  the  money  which  can  be  spent  by  candidates,  while  cutting  national  spending  limits  from  £20m  to  £15m.  The  commission  also  says  the  spending  limits  for  general  elections  should  cover  the  four  months  before  the  poll  -  as  happens  with  other  elections.  Electoral  Commission  chairman  Sam  Younger  said:  ""There  is  no  doubt  that  political  parties  have  a  vital  role  to  play  in  maintaining  the  health  of  our  democracy  and  for  this  they  need  to  be  adequately  resourced.  ""Our  research  has  shown  that  people  want  to  be  more  informed  about  party  politics  and  that  they  want  politicians  to  be  more  visible  and  accessible.

Matt  Lucas  and  David  Walliams  also  jointly  won  best  TV  comedy  actor  over  The  Office  creator  Ricky  Gervais,  who  won  a  special  award  for  writing.  It  was  also  a  good  night  for  Ant  and  Dec  who  clinched  two  awards,  including  best  comedy  entertainment  personality.  The  Geordie  duo  also  secured  best  comedy  entertainment  programme  for  Saturday  Night  Takeaway,  beating  I'm  A  Celebrity...  Get  Me  Out  Of  Here!,  which  they  also  host,  and  the  BBC's  Have  I  Got  News  For  You.  |||    The  ceremony  was  presented  by  Jonathan  Ross  from  ITV's  London  Studios  headquarters  on  the  capital's  South  Bank.  Little  Britain  began  life  as  a  radio  series  on  Radio  4,  with  Walliams  and  Lucas  playing  a  range  of  misfit  characters  from  an  alternative  Britain.  It  was  later  commissioned  for  BBC  Three,  where  it  proved  a  huge  success,  with  the  second  series  also  shown  on  BBC  One.  After  receiving  his  award  for  best  TV  comedy  actor  with  Walliams,  Lucas  said:  ""It's  a  great  honour  to  be  nominated  alongside  Ricky  Gervais  and  Martin  Clunes.""  |||    The  show  also  won  the  people's  choice  award,  which  is  the  only  gong  on  the  night  voted  for  by  viewers.  Speaking  after  receiving  the  award  for  best  comedy,  Walliams  said:  ""It  was  a  real  shock  but  I  don't  think  we  deserved  to  beat  The  Office  which  is  a  great  show  and  more  than  just  a  comedy.  It's  a  beautiful  piece  of  work.""  Gervais  and  The  Office  co-writer  Stephen  Merchant  received  a  special  award  for  writing,  presented  by  Noel  Gallagher  and  Tom  Stoppard.  Gervais  said:  ""The  show  has  won  an  awful  lot  of  awards  in  the  last  couple  of  years,  too  much.  It's  got  embarrassing  to  be  honest.""  Other  winners  at  the  awards  included  Caroline  Quentin,  who  took  home  best  TV  comedy  actress  for  Life  Begins  and  Von  Trapped.  |||    Catherine  Tate,  from  The  Catherine  Tate  Show,  was  also  nominated  for  the  same  award,  but  she  did  walk  away  with  best  comedy  newcomer,  over  James  McAvoy  from  Shameless  (Channel  4)  and  Julian  Barratt  and  Noel  Fielding  from  The  Mighty  Boosh  (BBC  Three).  Nighty  Night  was  named  Britain's  best  new  TV  comedy  over  ITV1  shows  Doc  Martin  and  Life  Begins.  But  Doc  Martin  won  best  TV  comedy  drama,  over  Jonathan  Creek  (BBC  One)  and  Shameless.  Winner  in  the  best  international  comedy  category  was  The  Simpsons,  beating  Sex  and  the  City  and  Curb  Your  Enthusiasm.  The  prize  was  accepted  by  Matt  Groening,  creator  of  The  Simpsons,  who  also  received  an  outstanding  contribution  award  from  scientist  Stephen  Hawking,  who  has  been  featured  in  the  series.  School  of  Rock  was  voted  best  comedy  film  beating  Shaun  of  the  Dead  and  Shrek  2.  |||    Matt  Lucas  &  David  Walliams  (Little  Britain,  BBC  Three)  |||    Caroline  Quentin  (Life  Begins/  Von  Trapped,  ITV1)  |||    Ant  &  Dec  (Ant  &  Dec's  Saturday  Night  Takeaway/  I'm  A  Celebrity,  Get  Me  Out  Of  Here!,  ITV1)  |||    Catherine  Tate  (The  Catherine  Tate  Show,  BBC  Two)  |||    Nighty  Night  (Baby  Cow  Productions,  BBC  Three)  |||    Little  Britain  (BBC  Three)  |||    Doc  Martin  (Buffalo  Productions,  ITV1)  |||    Ant  &  Dec's  Saturday  Night  Takeaway  (Granada,  ITV1)  |||    The  Simpsons  (Twentieth  Century  Fox,  BBC  Two/Sky  One/Channel  4)  |||    School  Of  Rock"

Shares  in  the  retailer  were  up  19.6%  at  $17.04  in  Tuesday  morning  trading  in  New  York  following  the  announcement.  Highfield  said  that  it  intends  to  take  the  Virginia-based  firm  private.  |||    ""Such  a  transformation  would  eliminate  the  public-company  transparency  into  the  company's  operating  strategy  that  is  uniquely  damaging  in  a  highly  competitive  industry  where  Circuit  City  is  going  head-to-head  with  a  tough  and  entrenched  rival,""  Highfield  said.

Bill  Armstrong,  a  retail  analyst  at  CL  King  &  Associates,  said  he  expected  to  see  other  private  investment  firms  come  forward  for  Circuit  City.  The  retailer  is  debt  free  with  a  good  cash  flow,  despite  the  fact  that  it  is  said  to  be  struggling  to  keep  up  with  market  leader  Best  Buy  and  cut-price  competition  from  the  likes  of  Wal-Mart,  said  Mr  Armstrong." 

1	"Obituary:  Dame  Alicia  Markova  |||    Dame  Alicia  Markova,  who  has  died  in  Bath  aged  94,  was  the  UK's  first  prima  ballerina  of  the  modern  age,  and,  in  her  heyday,  the  greatest  in  the  western  world.  |||    She  was  born  Lilian  Alicia  Marks  in  London  in  1910.  Her  parents  were  comfortably  off  -  her  father,  a  mining  engineer,  drove  a  Rolls  Royce.  When  she  was  eight,  her  mother  took  a  decision  which  changed  her  life.  Fearing  that  she  had  flat  feet  and  weak  legs,  she  arranged  for  her  to  have  ballet  lessons.  Very  quickly  it  became  apparent  that  she  was  something  special.  She  was  spotted  by  the  Russian  artistic  impresario,  Sergei  Diaghilev,  who  wanted  her  to  dance  for  his  company,  Ballets  Russes.  She  became  ill  with  diphtheria  but  kept  in  touch,  and,  eventually,  with  a  governess  in  tow,  joined  Diaghilev  in  Monte  Carlo  when  she  was  14.  |||    From  here,  she  toured  Europe,  playing  in  all  the  top  venues.  It  was  Diaghilev  who  changed  her  name  without  even  consulting  her.  Her  life  was  one  of  great  excitement.  People  such  as  Matisse  and  Stravinsky  became  like  uncles  to  her,  the  latter  put  in  charge  of  her  musical  education.  Soon  after  Diaghilev's  death  in  1929,  Alicia  Markova  returned  to  England  and  became  Britain's  first  international  ballerina.  She  helped  launch  the  Ballet  Club  at  the  Mercury  Theatre  (later  the  Ballet  Rambert),  the  Vic  Wells  Ballet,  and  then,  with  Anton  Dolin,  the  Markova-Dolin  Ballet  of  1935-37.  She  also  began  working  with  young  choreographers  such  as  Anthony  Tudor  and  Frederick  Ashton  who  became  huge  influences  on  the  direction  of  ballet  in  the  west.  |||    Her  version  of  Giselle,  all  lightness  and  grace,  is  still  considered  to  be  among  the  finest  ever.  She  was  also  outstanding  in  The  Dying  Swan.  She  was  one  of  the  first  British  ballerinas  to  take  a  major  part  in  Les  Sylphides.  She,  above  all,  helped  popularise  ballet  both  in  Britain  and  in  America.  |||    Alicia  Markova  spent  World  War  II  in  the  United  States  where,  in  a  re-formed  Ballets  Russes,  she  played  to  huge  audiences.  She  even  appeared  in  Hollywood  movies.  In  1950,  back  in  England,  she  and  Anton  Dolin  jointly  established  the  Festival  Ballet.  She  retired  in  1963,  an  ""instant  decision""  she  said,  ""largely  because  of  a  leg  injury"".  Created  a  Dame,  she  made  a  new  career  for  herself  as  a  teacher.  She  also  travelled  the  world  directing  ballet  companies  and  putting  on  shows.  She  became  director  of  ballet  for  the  Metropolitan  Opera  Ballet  in  New  York,  and  for  some  years  was  full-time  Professor  of  Ballet  and  Performing  Arts  in  the  University  of  Cincinnati.  A  critic  once  said  of  Dame  Alicia  Markova's  dancing:  ""She  gave  the  illusion  of  moving  as  if  she  had  no  weight  to  get  off  the  ground."""

His  nomination  by  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  came  as  a  surprise,  and  led  to  gains  on  the  Tel  Aviv  stock  market.  Mr  Fischer,  who  speaks  fluent  Hebrew,  will  have  to  become  an  Israeli  citizen  to  take  the  job.  The  US  says  he  will  not  have  to  give  up  US  citizenship  to  do  so.  |||    Previous  incumbent  David  Klein,  who  often  argued  with  the  Finance  Ministry,  steps  down  on  16  January.  Mr  Fischer  will  face  a  delicate  balancing  act  -  both  in  political  and  economic  terms  -  between  Mr  Sharon  and  finance  minister  Binyamin  Netanyahu,  who  also  backed  his  nomination.  But  his  appointment  has  also  raised  hopes  that  it  could  bring  in  fresh  investment  -  and  perhaps  even  an  improvement  in  the  country's  credit  rating  Mr  Fischer  first  went  to  Israel  for  six  months  in  1973,  and  almost  emigrated  there  before  deciding  finally  to  return  to  the  US.  While  teaching  at  the  Massachussetts  Institute  of  Technology  he  spent  a  month  seconded  to  the  Bank  of  Israel  in  1979,  beginning  a  long-time  involvement  in  studying  Israel's  economy.  In  1983  Mr  Fischer  became  adviser  on  Israel's  economy  to  then-US  secretary  of  state  George  Shultz.  At  the  World  Bank  in  1985,  he  participated  in  drawing  up  an  economic  stabilisation  package  for  Israel."

RHB,  Malaysia's  third-biggest  lender,  is  already  scouting  for  a  foreign  partner  for  its  new  Islamic  banking  unit,  the  firm  told  Reuters.  The  moves  put  Malaysia  ahead  of  a  2007  deadline  to  open  up  the  sector.  The  country's  deal  to  join  the  World  Trade  Organisation  set  that  year  as  a  deadline  for  liberalisation  of  Islamic  banking.  Also  on  Tuesday,  the  central  bank  released  growth  figures  showing  Malaysia's  economy  expanded  7.1%  in  2004.  But  growth  slowed  sharply  in  the  fourth  quarter  to  5.6%,  and  the  central  bank  said  it  expected  6%  expansion  in  2005.  |||    Malaysia  changed  the  law  to  allow  Islamic  banking  in  1983.  It  has  granted  licences  to  three  Middle  Eastern  groups,  which  -  along  with  local  players  -  mean  there  are  eight  fully-operational  Islamic  banking  groups  in  the  country.  Islamic  banks  offer  services  which  permit  modern  banking  principles  while  sticking  to  Islamic  law's  ban  on  the  payment  of  interest.  Most  of  the  Malays  which  make  up  half  the  country's  population  are  Muslims."

Revenues  were  £4.3bn  while  the  firm's  operating  margins  were  14.1%,  which  it  said  could  reach  14.8%  by  2006.  During  the  year  WPP  bought  US  rival  Grey  Global,  creating  a  giant  big  enough  to  rival  sector  leader  Omnicom.  |||    Chief  Executive  Martin  Sorrell  on  Friday  told  Reuters  news  agency  that  WPP  had  submitted  a  proposal  for  United  Business  Media's  NOP  World  market  research  unit.  Analysts  say  the  unit  sell  could  sell  for  up  to  £350m.  WPP  in  recent  years  has  also  bought  firms  such  as  Ogilvy  &  Mather  and  Cordiant  Communications.  It  also  includes  the  firms  Young  &  Rubicam  and  J  Walter  Thompson.  Events  such  as  the  Olympics  helped  boost  WPP's  profits  in  2004.  The  company  said  the  US  Congressional  elections  and  the  FIFA  World  Cup  are  likely  to  present  advertising  opportunities  in  the  near  future.  The  long-term  outlook  looks  ""very  favourable""  because  of  media  and  technology  developments  and  the  strength  of  the  US  economy,  WPP  said."

Ocean's  12  fell  to  number  two  while  new  entry  Spanglish  entered  the  chart  at  number  three,  taking  $9m  (£4.6m).  A  Series  of  Unfortunate  Events  also  stars  Scottish  comedian  Billy  Connelly,  while  Carrey  takes  on  a  number  of  different  roles  in  the  surreal  film.  The  only  other  new  entry  in  the  top  10  was  re-make,  Flight  of  the  Phoenix,  at  number  eight,  starring  Dennis  Quaid.  Carrey  entertained  crowds  at  the  UK  premiere  of  Lemony  Snicket  in  London  on  Friday.  The  actor  grabbed  co-star  Meryl  Streep  and  whisked  her  around  Leicester  Square.

However,  the  country's  vice  president  Jose  Alencar  has  said  the  government  still  is  looking  for  a  solution.  Varig  is  struggling  under  a  huge  debt  burden  of  an  estimated  debt  of  6.5  billion  reais  ($2.3bn  or  £1.2bn).  Asked  whether  a  rescue  was  on  the  cards  following  a  meeting  of  the  country's  Congress  to  discuss  the  airline's  crisis,  Mr  Alencar  replied:  ""No,  I  don't  think  so.  We  will  see.""  |||    Earlier,  Mr  Wilson  had  said  that  president  Luiz  Inacio  Lula  da  Silva  has  decided  to  step  in  and  a  decree  of  some  kind  of  intervention  could  be  signed  this  week.  ""In  practice,  it  will  be  an  intervention,  although  this  is  not  the  technical  name  used"",  he  said.  An  intervention  means  that  the  government  would  take  administrative  control  of  the  company  and  its  finances.  For  that  to  happen  Varig's  main  shareholder,  the  non-profit  Ruben  Berta  Foundation  which  represents  the  airline's  employees,  would  have  to  be  removed,  Mr  Wilson  said.  However,  no  jobs  would  be  lost  and  the  airline  would  keep  on  flying,  he  added.  Varig,  which  operates  in  18  countries  apart  from  Brazil,  has  been  driven  to  the  brink  of  collapse  because  of  the  country's  economic  downturn.  |||    The  depreciation  of  Brazil's  currency  has  had  a  direct  impact  on  the  airline's  dollar  debt  as  well  as  some  of  its  costs.  Business  has  improved  recently  with  demand  for  air  travel  increasing  and  a  recovery  in  the  Brazilian  economy.  The  airline  could  also  win  a  sizeable  windfall  from  a  compensation  claim  against  the  government.  On  Tuesday  the  courts  awarded  Varig  2bn  reais  ($725m),  after  ruling  in  favour  of  its  compensation  claim  against  the  government  for  freezing  tariffs  from  1985  to  1992.  But  the  government  can  appeal  the  decision."

The  island  state  is  asking  for  about  $320m  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  to  help  pay  for  relief,  he  said.  The  bank  has  5bn  rupees  ($50m;  £27m)  set  aside  to  lend  at  a  lower  interest  rate  to  those  who  lost  property.  According  to  Mr  Mendis,  half  the  IMF  support  could  come  from  a  freeze  on  debt  repayments,  which  would  free  up  resources  immediately.  The  rest  could  come  from  a  five-year  emergency  loan.  Sri  Lanka  is  hoping  for  a  wider  freeze  from  other  creditors.  |||    The  Paris  Club  of  19  creditors  meets  on  12  January  to  discuss  a  debt  moratorium  for  the  nations  hit  by  the  tsunami,  which  ravaged  south  and  east  Asia  on  26  December.  |||    Some  150,000  people  across  the  region  are  feared  to  be  dead  and  millions  have  been  left  homeless  and  destitute.  A  full  reckoning  of  the  economic  cost  to  Sri  Lanka  of  the  tsunami  will  not  be  clear  for  some  time  to  come.  But  already  it  looks  likely  that  growth  in  the  first  half  of  2005  will  slow,  Mr  Mendis  told  reporters,  although  he  would  not  say  by  how  much.  One  side-effect  of  the  disaster  has  been  that  the  value  of  the  rupee  has  risen  as  foreign  funds  have  flooded  into  the  country.  The  currency  has  strengthened  4%  since  late  December,  coming  close  to  100  rupees  to  the  US  dollar  for  the  first  time  in  more  than  six  months." 

2	"Police  urge  pub  closure  power  |||    New  powers  are  needed  to  close  disorderly  pubs,  bars  and  clubs  for  up  to  a  week  or  even  permanently,  police  chiefs  have  told  MPs.  |||    Association  of  Chief  Police  Officers  president  Chris  Fox  said  the  current  24-hour  closure  power  did  not  have  enough  impact  on  bad  landlords.  Mr  Fox's  comments  follow  the  controversy  over  plans  to  allow  pubs  to  open  around  the  clock.  He  rejected  critics'  calls  for  the  law  change  to  be  delayed.  Instead,  the  new  Licensing  Act  could  help  reduce  drunken  disorder  -  but  only  if  it  was  properly  planned,  he  argued.  |||    Acpo  made  its  call  for  stronger  closure  powers  in  a  paper  for  the  Commons  home  affairs  select  committee.  After  the  meeting,  Mr  Fox  said  being  able  to  close  premises  for  only  24  hours  did  not  necessarily  make  an  impact.  ""If  it's  12.30  on  a  Saturday  morning  and  you  close  for  24  hours  there's  not  a  lot  of  pain  for  the  premises  because  they  probably  wouldn't  open  on  Sunday  anyway.  |||    ""This  is  about  getting  through  to  the  management  that  they  can't  run  a  disorderly  house  without  facing  some  immediate  sanctions.""  Under  Acpo's  proposal,  the  closure  orders  would  be  used  only  with  the  agreement  of  the  local  licensing  authority.  The  new  licensing  laws  will  give  police  greater  powers  to  close  pubs  and  clubs  -  but  only  for  24-hour  periods.  |||    Mr  Fox  said  the  drinks  industry  was  currently  not  regulating  itself.  ""It's  making  money  at  the  cost  of  human  misery  and  the  public  purse,  and  the  strategic  planning  process  has  been  less  than  useless,""  he  said.  Mr  Fox  said  the  new  laws,  due  to  start  being  phased  in  next  month,  could  help  if  food  outlets,  public  transport  and  public  toilets  could  cope  with  late-night  drinkers.  ""Staggering  it  (closing  hours)  will  be  a  solution  if  the  infrastructure  is  there,  if  the  premises  are  properly  managed  and  people  aren't  being  served  rolling  drunk  and  underage  and  then  tossed  out  into  the  street,""  he  said.  ""We  have  the  problem  from  11pm  to  2am  in  any  event.  We  have  to  get  a  grip  on  the  underlying  causes  of  this.""  |||    Acpo  wants  pubs  and  clubs  which  cause  extra  work  for  police  and  hospitals  to  have  to  pay  towards  the  costs.  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  is  currently  looking  at  the  idea  of  a  levy  on  the  drinks  industry  to  pay  for  the  cost  of  extra  policing.  The  licensing  changes  have  sparked  concern  among  some  MPs,  councils  and  some  senior  police  officers  who  fear  they  could  exacerbate  drinking  problems.  Culture  Secretary  Tessa  Jowell  on  Tuesday  said  it  was  not  her  job  to  bow  to  the  campaign  against  the  changes.  It  was  the  status  quo,  not  the  new  laws,  which  were  causing  current  binge  drinking  problems,  she  told  BBC  Two's  Newsnight.  Leaked  documents  have  suggested  ex-Home  Secretary  David  Blunkett  branded  new  opening  hours  as  a  ""leap  in  the  dark"".  But  Ms  Jowell  insisted  his  concerns  had  been  met.  The  police's  job  against  alcohol-related  crime  would  be  made  easier  if  all  pubs  did  not  close  at  the  same  time,  she  added." 

2	"Brown  ally  rejects  Budget  spree  |||    Chancellor  Gordon  Brown's  closest  ally  has  denied  suggestions  there  will  be  a  Budget  giveaway  on  16  March.  |||    Ed  Balls,  ex-chief  economic  adviser  to  the  Treasury,  said  there  would  be  no  spending  spree  before  polling  day.  But  Mr  Balls,  a  prospective  Labour  MP,  said  he  was  confident  the  chancellor  would  meet  his  fiscal  rules.  He  was  speaking  as  Sir  Digby  Jones,  CBI  director  general,  warned  Mr  Brown  not  to  be  tempted  to  use  any  extra  cash  on  pre-election  bribes.  |||    Mr  Balls,  who  stepped  down  from  his  Treasury  post  to  stand  as  a  Labour  candidate  in  the  election,  had  suggested  that  Mr  Brown  would  meet  his  golden  economic  rule  -  ""with  a  margin  to  spare"".  He  said  he  hoped  more  would  be  done  to  build  on  current  tax  credit  rules.  |||    He  also  stressed  rise  in  interest  rates  ahead  of  an  expected  May  election  would  not  affect  the  Labour  Party's  chances  of  winning.  Expectations  of  a  rate  rise  have  gathered  pace  after  figures  showed  house  prices  are  still  rising.  Consumer  borrowing  rose  at  a  near-record  pace  in  January.  ""If  the  MPC  (the  Bank  of  England's  Monetary  Policy  Committee)  were  to  judge  that  a  rate  rise  was  justified  before  the  election  because  of  the  strength  of  the  economy  -  and  I'm  not  predicting  that  they  will  -  I  do  not  believe  that  this  will  be  a  big  election  issue  in  Britain  for  Labour,""  he  told  a  Parliamentary  lunch.  ""This  is  a  big  change  in  our  political  culture.""  |||    During  an  interview  with  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme,  Mr  Balls  said  he  was  sure  Mr  Brown's  Budget  would  not  put  at  risk  the  stability  of  the  economy.  ""I  don't  think  we'll  see  a  pre-election  spending  spree  -  we  certainly  did  not  see  that  before  2001,""  he  said.  |||    His  assurances  came  after  Sir  Digby  Jones  said  stability  was  all  important  and  any  extra  cash  should  be  spent  on  improving  workers'  skills.  His  message  to  the  chancellor  was:  ""Please  don't  give  it  away  in  any  form  of  electioneering.""  Sir  Digby  added:  ""I  don't  think  he  will.  I  have  to  say  he  has  been  a  prudent  chancellor  right  the  way  through.  Stability  is  the  key  word  -  British  business  needs  boring  stability  more  than  anything.  ""We  would  say  to  him  'don't  increase  your  public  spending,  don't  give  it  away.  But  if  you  are  going  to  anywhere,  just  add  something  to  the  competitiveness  of  Britain,  put  it  into  skilling  our  people'.  ""That  would  be  a  good  way  to  spend  any  excess.""  |||    Mr  Balls  refused  to  say  whether  Mr  Brown  would  remain  as  chancellor  after  the  election,  amid  speculation  he  will  be  offered  the  job  of  Foreign  Secretary.  ""I  think  that  Gordon  Brown  wants  to  be  part  of  the  successful  Labour  government  which  delivers  in  the  third  term  for  the  priorities  of  the  people  and  sees  off  a  Conservative  Party  that  will  take  Britain  backwards,""  Mr  Balls  told  Today.  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  has  yet  to  name  the  date  of  the  election,  but  most  pundits  are  betting  on  5  May." 

2	"UK's  'useless'  quangos  under  fire  |||    The  UK  has  529  quangos  financed  with  billions  of  pounds  of  taxpayers'  cash  -  many  of  which  are  useless  or  duplicate  each  other's  efforts,  a  report  claims.  |||    Essential  Guide  to  British  Quangos  2005  author  Dan  Lewis  said  at  least  111  of  the  appointed  bodies  had  been  set  up  since  Labour  won  power  in  1997.  He  urged  a  limit  on  the  number  of  quangos  that  could  be  set  up  by  any  individual  government  department.  Tories  and  Lib  Dems  welcomed  the  report  and  called  for  a  ""slimming  down"".  |||    Conservative  deregulation  spokesman  John  Redwood  said:  ""The  research  endorses  our  policy  of  destroying  unwanted  and  unnecessary  quangos,  and  slimming  down  the  rest.  |||    ""A  Conservative  government  will  axe  162  quangos,  as  part  of  its  drive  for  more  efficient  and  more  accountable  government.""  Lib  Dem  spokesman  Ed  Davey  meanwhile  said  instead  of  the  ""bonfire  of  quangos""  New  Labour  had  promised,  there  had  been  an  ""explosion""  of  them.  ""For  over  two  decades,  under  both  Tory  and  Labour  governments,  these  unaccountable  agencies  have  mushroomed.  ""Liberal  Democrats  would  abolish  many,  merge  others,  and  make  any  that  remain  properly  accountable.""  Labour  representatives  were  unavailable  for  comment.  The  quango  guide  follows  last  year's  government-commissioned  Gershon  Report  which  recommended  significant  cuts  in  bureaucracy  across  the  public  sector.  |||    Mr  Lewis  wants  a  public  inquiry  into  regional  development  agencies  which  cost  £1.8bn  a  year  -  cash  he  says  which  ""appears  to  be  almost  entirely  wasted"".  As  well  as  a  departmental  limit  on  quangos  he  also  wants  a  statutory  five-year  limit  on  any  such  body  with  executive  powers.  He  also  listed  what  he  dubbed  the  nine  ""most  useless  quangos"".  They  were  the  British  Potato  Council,  the  Milk  Development  Council,  the  Energy  Savings  Trust,  Agricultural  Wages  Committees,  the  Wine  Standards  Board,  the  Westminster  Foundation  for  Democracy,  the  Football  Licensing  Authority,  Investors  in  People  UK  and  the  Economic  and  Social  Research  Council.  Mr  Lewis  branded  the  existence  of  the  60-employee  Potato  Council,  set  up  in  1997  to  research  and  promote  overseas  potato  markets,  ""surprising"".  He  said  the  £80m  spent  annually  on  the  Energy  Savings  Trust,  which  promotes  renewable  energy,  would  be  better  spent  on  eight  million  boiler  jackets  for  British  homes.  |||    And  he  argued  it  was  ""absurd""  to  charge  farmers  for  Agricultural  Wages  Committees,  which  set  working  and  wage  standards  in  the  industry,  when  many  were  prepared  to  take  advantage  of  immigrant  labour  prepared  to  work  for  £1  an  hour.  ""If  a  football  team  can  afford  to  pay  £27m  for  Wayne  Rooney,  why  should  the  taxpayer  -  not  all  of  whom  like  football  -  be  forced  to  fund  the  Football  Licensing  Authority  to  the  tune  of  over  £1.1m  a  year?""  Mr  Lewis  asked.  The  report  is  published  by  the  Efficiency  in  Government  Unit  -  a  joint  effort  by  right  of  centre  think  tanks  the  Economic  Research  Council  and  the  Centre  for  Policy  Studies.  It  says  before  a  new  public  body  is  set  up,  an  assessment  should  be  made  whether  its  proposed  role  is  already  carried  out  by  an  existing  charity  or  other  private  organisation."

Splits  were  marketed  as  a  low-risk  way  to  benefit  from  rising  share  prices.  But  when  the  stock  market  collapsed  in  2000,  the  products  left  thousands  of  investors  out  of  pocket.  An  estimated  50,000  people  took  out  split-capital  funds,  some  investing  their  life  savings  in  the  schemes.  The  paying  of  compensation  will  be  overseen  by  an  independent  company,  the  FSA  said.  |||    Further  details  of  how  investors  will  be  able  to  claim  their  share  of  the  compensation  package  will  be  announced  in  the  new  year.  ""This  should  save  investors  from  having  to  take  their  case  to  the  Financial  Ombudsman  Service,  something,  no  doubt,  that  will  be  very  welcome,""  Rob  McIvor,  FSA  spokesman,  told  BBC  News.  Agreeing  to  pay  compensation  did  not  mean  that  the  eighteen  firms  involved  were  admitting  any  guilt,  the  FSA  added.  Any  investor  accepting  the  compensation  will  have  to  waive  the  right  to  take  their  case  to  the  Financial  Ombudsman  Service.  |||    The  FSA  has  been  investigating  whether  investors  were  misled  about  the  risks  posed  by  split-capital  investment  trusts.  The  FSA's  60  strong  investigation  team  looked  into  whether  fund  managers  colluded  in  a  so-called  ""magic  circle"",  in  the  hope  of  propping  up  one  another's  share  prices.  |||    Firms  involved  were  presented  with  780  files  of  evidence  detailing  27,000  taped  conversations  and  over  70  interviews.  In  May,  the  FSA  was  widely  reported  as  having  asked  firms  to  pay  up  to  £350m  in  compensation.  Mr  McIvor  told  the  BBC  that  the  final  settlement  figure  was  smaller  because  two  unnamed  firms  had  pulled  out  of  the  compensation  negotiations.  Investors  in  these  two  firms  may  now  have  to  take  any  compensation  claim  to  the  Financial  Ombudsman  Service  or  the  courts."

The  performance  comes  on  sales  up  21%  at  8.6bn  euros.  The  firm,  formerly  Interbrew,  became  the  world's  biggest  brewer  by  volume  when  it  bought  Ambev  in  August  2004.  The  acquisition  meant  its  sales  by  volume  grew  57%  in  2004,  with  four  months  of  Ambev  sales  accounting  for  almost  all  of  the  increase.  US  beermaker  Anheuser-Busch  sells  less  beer  by  volume  than  Inbev  but  is  bigger  in  terms  of  the  value  of  its  sales.  Continuing  demand  for  Inbev's  products  in  the  South  American  markets  where  its  Brazilian  arm  is  most  popular  means  it  expects  to  keep  boosting  its  turnover.  ""It's  the  Brazil  business  that's  doing  it,""  said  ING  analyst  Gerard  Rijk  of  Inbev's  strong  performance.  Ambev  boosted  its  share  of  Brazil's  beer  market  from  62%  at  the  end  of  2003  to  more  than  68%  by  December  2004,  Inbev  reported.  In  contrast,  Inbev's  European  business  saw  volume  sales  fall  2.5%,  although  Central  and  Eastern  European  sales  rose  12%.  Overall,  net  profits  were  up  42%  to  719m  euros."

Senate  sources  say  the  missing  tapes  may  have  been  stolen  from  a  plane  by  baggage  handlers.  The  bank  gave  no  details  of  how  the  records  disappeared,  but  said  they  had  probably  not  been  misused.  Customers'  accounts  were  being  monitoring  and  account  holders  would  be  notified  if  any  ""unusual  activity""  was  detected,  bank  officials  said.  |||    Bank  of  America  said  the  tapes  went  missing  in  December  while  being  shipped  to  a  back-up  data  centre.  ""We,  with  federal  law  authorities,  have  done  a  very  robust,  thorough  investigation  on  this  and  neither  we  nor  they  would  make  the  statement  lightly  that  we  believe  those  tapes  to  be  lost,""  Alexandra  Tower,  a  spokeswoman  for  the  North  Carolina-based  bank,  told  Time  magazine.  But  although  there  was  no  evidence  of  criminal  activity,  the  bank  said,  the  Secret  Service  -  a  federal  agency  whose  brief  includes  investigations  of  serious  financial  crime  -  is  said  to  be  looking  into  the  loss.  New  York  Senator  Charles  Schumer  said  he  was  told  by  the  Senate  Rules  Committee  that  the  tapes  were  probably  stolen  from  a  commercial  plane.  ""Whether  it  is  identity  theft,  terrorism,  or  other  theft,  in  this  new  complicated  world  baggage  handlers  should  have  background  checks  and  more  care  should  be  taken  for  who  is  hired  for  these  increasingly  sensitive  positions,""  the  Democrat  senator  said.  Details  of  his  Vermont  colleague  Pat  Leahy's  credit  card  account  are  among  those  missing,  Senator  Leahy's  spokeswoman  Tracy  Schmaler  said.  About  900,000  military  and  civilian  staff  at  the  defence  department  are  among  the  1.2  million  affected,  according  to  a  Pentagon  spokesman."

Ms  Druyun  is  currently  serving  a  nine  month  sentence  for  favouring  Boeing  when  awarding  lucrative  contracts.  Boeing  lost  a  $23bn  government  contract  after  a  Pentagon  inquiry  into  the  case.  The  contract,  to  provide  refuelling  tankers  for  the  US  Air  Force,  was  cancelled  last  year.  |||    The  Pentagon  revealed  earlier  this  week  that  it  would  examine  eight  other  contracts  worth  $3bn  which  it  believes  may  have  been  tainted  by  Ms  Druyun's  role  in  the  procurement  process.  Boeing  sacked  Mr  Sears  and  Ms  Druyun  in  November  2003  after  allegations  that  they  had  violated  company  recruitment  policy.  Ms  Druyun  had  talks  with  Mr  Sears  in  October  2002  about  working  for  Boeing,  while  she  was  still  a  top  procurement  official  within  the  Pentagon.  She  subsequently  joined  the  company  in  January  2003.  Ms  Druyun  admitted  that  she  had  steered  multi-billion  dollar  contracts  to  Boeing  and  other  favoured  companies.  |||    In  documents  filed  in  a  Virginia  court  ahead  of  Mr  Sears'  sentencing,  prosecutors  blamed  Boeing's  senior  management  for  failing  to  ask  key  questions  about  the  ""legal  and  ethical  issues""  surrounding  Ms  Druyun's  appointment.  Mr  Sears  told  prosecutors  that  no  other  Boeing  officials  were  aware  that  Ms  Druyun  was  still  responsible  for  major  procurement  decisions  at  the  time  she  was  discussing  a  job  with  Boeing.  However,  analysts  believe  Boeing  may  yet  face  civil  charges  arising  from  the  scandal.  The  Pentagon  has  investigated  400  contracts,  dating  back  to  1993,  since  the  allegations  against  Ms  Druyun  came  to  light.  |||    Boeing's  corporate  ethics  have  come  under  scrutiny  on  several  occasions  in  recent  years.  Boeing  was  sued  by  Lockheed  Martin  after  its  rival  accused  it  of  industrial  espionage  during  a  1998  contract  competition.  Boeing  apologised  publicly  for  the  affair  -  although  it  claimed  it  did  not  gain  any  unfair  advantage  -  and  pledged  to  improve  its  procedures.  The  Pentagon  subsequently  revoked  $1bn  worth  of  contracts  assigned  to  Boeing  and  prohibited  the  Seattle-based  company  from  future  rocket  work."

The  move  follows  News  Corp's  decision  to  register  its  business  in  the  US.  20th  Century  Fox's  recent  film  releases  include  I  Heart  Huckabees  and  I,  Robot,  while  Fox  puts  out  hit  TV  series  24.  |||    Under  the  terms  of  the  offer,  minority  Fox  shareholders  will  receive  1.90  News  Corp  shares  in  return  for  each  Fox  share  they  hold.  Analysts  said  the  decision  to  list  News  Corp  in  the  US  -  which  will  result  in  the  firm's  shares  trading  in  New  York  rather  than  Sydney-  nullified  the  need  to  retain  a  separate  stock  market  listing  for  Fox  Entertainment  shares.  News  Corp  investors  voted  in  October  to  approve  the  transfer  of  the  company's  corporate  domicile  from  Australia  to  the  US  state  of  Delaware.  The  move  is  designed  to  help  News  Corp  attract  more  investment  from  the  largest  US  financial  institutions,  and  make  it  easier  to  raise  capital.  Fox  Entertainment  Group  generated  revenues  of  $12bn  last  year.  News  Corp  shares  fell  25  cents  to  $17.65  after  the  share  offer  was  announced  while  Fox  shares  were  up  19  cents  at  $31.22."

Prime  Minister  Ephraim  Inoni,  who  vowed  to  tackle  corruption  when  he  came  to  office  last  year,  said  those  found  guilty  would  face  tough  punishments.  The  scam  is  believed  to  have  begun  in  1994.  |||    The  prime  minister's  office  said  the  alleged  fraud  was  uncovered  during  an  investigation  into  the  payroll  at  the  ministry.  In  certain  cases,  staff  are  said  to  have  lied  about  their  rank  and  delayed  their  retirement  in  order  to  boost  their  earnings.  The  prime  minister's  office  said  auditors  had  found  ""irregularities  in  the  career  structure  of  certain  civil  servants"".  It  added  that  the  staff  in  question  ""appear  to  have  received  unearned  salaries,  boosting  the  payroll"".  |||    Fidelis  Nanga,  a  journalist  based  in  the  Cameroon  capital  Yaounde,  said  the  government  was  considering  taking  criminal  action  against  those  found  guilty  and  forcing  them  to  repay  any  money  owed.  ""The  prime  minister  has  given  instructions  for  exemplary  penalties  to  be  meted  out  against  the  accused  and  their  accomplices  if  found  guilty,""  he  told  the  BBC's  Network  Africa  programme.  |||    Mr  Inoni  launched  an  anti-corruption  drive  in  December  after  foreign  investors  criticised  a  lack  of  transparency  in  the  country's  public  finances.  In  one  initiative  designed  to  improve  efficiency,  civil  servants  who  arrived  late  for  work  were  locked  out  of  their  offices.  The  government  now  intends  to  carry  out  an  audit  of  payrolls  at  all  other  government  ministries.  In  a  report  compiled  by  anti-corruption  body  Transparency  International  in  2003,  graft  was  said  to  be  ""pervasive""  in  Cameroon."

It  features  the  singer  talking  about  both  his  career  and  his  personal  life,  from  his  days  in  Wham!  through  to  more  recent  events.  Michael  will  attend  the  festival  to  introduce  the  screening  on  16  February.  Director  Southan  Morris  and  executive  producer  Andy  Stephens  will  also  attend  the  festival.  |||    The  93  minute  film  will  see  Michael  discussing  his  early  days  in  Wham!  along  with  his  later  career,  including  his  legal  battles  with  record  label  Sony  and  his  stance  against  the  Iraq  war  and  American  politics.  It  will  also  touch  upon  his  turbulent  personal  life,  including  his  arrest  in  a  Beverly  Hills  park  toilet  in  1998  for  ""lewd  behaviour"",  and  the  death  of  his  boyfriend  Anselmo  Feleppa  from  Aids.  The  film,  which  includes  previously  unseen  footage  of  the  singer  also  features  contributions  from  Michael's  former  Wham!  partner  Andrew  Ridgeley,  as  well  as  ex-Wham!  backing  singers  Pepsi  and  Shirlie.  Other  contributors  include  Sting,  Mariah  Carey,  Elton  John,  Noel  Gallagher,  Geri  Halliwell  and  Simon  Cowell.  This  year's  festival  will  open  with  Man  To  Man,  a  historical  epic  starring  Joseph  Fiennes  and  Kristin  Scott-Thomas.  It  will  be  one  of  21  films  competing  for  the  festival's  top  prize,  the  Golden  Bear.

2	"Tories  plan  migrant  health  checks  |||    Non-European  Union  citizens  wanting  to  work  in  the  UK  will  have  to  undergo  tests  for  Tuberculosis  and  HIV,  under  plans  unveiled  by  the  Conservatives.  |||    A  positive  test  for  TB  would  mean  visa  applications  being  turned  down,  while  HIV  would  be  dealt  with  case  by  case.  Leader  Michael  Howard  said  the  checks  on  new  arrivals  would  help  protect  public  health  and  the  NHS.  Labour  said  many  tests  were  already  done.  The  Lib  Dems  warned  both  parties  against  ""pandering  to  prejudice"".  |||    The  proposals,  which  would  be  brought  in  if  the  Conservatives  won  the  General  Election,  would  not  apply  to  people  coming  to  the  UK  for  less  than  six  months  unless  they  intended  to  work  in  health  or  childcare  or  teaching.  Mr  Howard  said  the  plans  were  based  on  policies  already  in  action  in  Canada,  New  Zealand  and  Australia.  ""It's  very  important  that  we  should  safeguard  the  good  standards  of  public  health  that  Britain  enjoys,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  Government  figures  suggest  TB  in  England  has  increased  by  25%  over  the  past  10  years.  ""Nearly  two  thirds  of  people  with  TB  are  born  abroad,""  said  Mr  Howard.  |||    ""I  don't  think  a  responsible  government  can  stand  aside  and  do  nothing  in  the  face  of  this  problem.""  But  Mr  Howard  said  the  plans  would  not  affect  asylum  applicants'  claims.  The  proposals  include:  |||    -  People  coming  to  the  UK  from  outside  the  EU  for  between  six  and  12  months  from  a  ""high  incidence  TB  country""  will  have  to  undergo  a  chest  X-ray.      -  People  coming  to  settle  in  the  UK  permanently  from  outside  the  EU  will  have  to  ""demonstrate  they  have  an  acceptable  standard  of  health"".      -  They  will  also  have  to  show  they  are  unlikely  to  be  a  danger  to  public  health  and  are  unlikely  to  ""impose  significant  costs  or  demands""  on  the  NHS.      -  The  tests  will  include  a  health  check,  chest  X-rays  for  TB  (except  for  children  and  pregnant  women)  and  tests  for  hepatitis  and  HIV  for  over  16-year-olds.  Only  the  discovery  of  TB  will  mean  people  will  be  automatically  denied  a  visa,  other  conditions  will  be  dealt  with  on  a  ""case  by  case  basis"".  |||    There  is  already  some  screening  in  place.  Last  year  185,000  people  were  tested  for  TB  at  Heathrow  and  Gatwick  airports,  only  about  200  were  found  to  be  infected.  And  Dr  John  Moore-Gillon,  of  the  British  Lung  Foundation,  said:  ""TB  is  not  simply  imported,  we  are  seeing  a  rise  in  many  sections  of  the  UK-born  population  as  well.""  The  government  says  the  Tories  are  ""a  bit  late""  to  the  issue.  Immigration  minister  Des  Browne  quoted  its  five-year  plan  for  immigration  and  asylum,  as  saying:  ""We  are  implementing  our  existing  powers  by  targeted  health  screening  for  TB  in  high-risk  areas  at  the  entry  clearance  stage.  ""Those  who  are  diagnosed  would  then  need  to  seek  treatment  at  home  before  being  allowed  to  enter  the  UK.""  Meanwhile  Mark  Oaten,  Liberal  Democrat  home  affairs  spokesman,  said:  ""This  is  another  worrying  step  in  the  war  of  words  over  asylum  and  immigration  between  Labour  and  the  Conservatives.  ""Michael  Howard  knows  perfectly  well  what  bigger  game  he  is  playing,  and  history  proves  it  is  a  very  dangerous  one.""  Lisa  Power,  head  of  policy  at  Aids  charity  the  Terrence  Higgins  Trust  said  the  policy  was  prejudice-based  rather  than  evidence-based.  ""In  fact,  it  would  be  more  likely  to  drive  people  with  health  conditions  to  falsify  tests  while  others  gain  entry  by  simple  dint  of  their  EU  status,""  she  said." 

2	"Labour  in  constituency  race  row  |||    Labour's  choice  of  a  white  candidate  for  one  of  the  UK's  most  multi-racial  seats  proves  the  need  for  all-black  short  lists,  says  a  race  group.  |||    Local  councillor  Lyn  Brown  was  selected  for  West  Ham,  east  London,  in  a  contest  between  two  white  and  five  ethnic  minority  women.  An  Operation  Black  Vote  spokesman  said  they  now  wanted  to  meet  Labour  party  chairman  Ian  McCartney  for  discussions.  Mr  McCartney  recently  announced  party  consultation  on  all-black  shortlists.  However,  Labour  has  so  far  unable  been  unable  to  comment  on  the  implications  of  the  West  Ham  result.  |||    Ashok  Vishwanathan  of  Operation  Black  Vote,  which  aims  to  increase  ethnic  minorities'  participation  in  the  political  process  and  their  representation,  said  the  result  again  showed  all-women  shortlists  were  not  effective  in  getting  minority  women  selected.  ""I  think  all-black  shortlists  are  the  only  way  to  cut  to  the  chase  and  address  the  lack  of  minority  candidates,""  Mr  Vishwanathan  said.  |||    Last  month  the  chairman  of  the  Commission  for  Racial  Equality  (CRE)  also  called  for  ethnic  minority  shortlists  in  certain  circumstances.  A  CRE  spokesman  said  the  organisation  had  nothing  to  add  on  the  shortlist  issue  specifically  but  would  be  working  with  all  the  political  parties  to  address  the  under-representation  of  ethnic  minorities  in  Parliament.  ""We  will  be  raising  it  with  each  of  the  party  leaders  on  a  formal  basis  and  helping  them  find  the  most  appropriate  way  forward,""  the  spokesman  said.  Ethnic  minorities  make  up  8%  of  the  United  Kingdom  population  but  only  2%  of  MPs  -  13  out  of  659  -  are  from  a  visible  minority  group.  Twelve  of  them  represent  Labour,  and  one  is  a  Liberal  Democrat.  If  ethnic  minorities  were  represented  in  the  House  of  Commons  in  proportion  to  their  numbers  in  the  population,  there  would  be  42  ethnic  minority  MPs."

But  on  Wednesday  Prime  Minister  Yulia  Tymoshenko  said  the  government  was  planning  to  renationalise  3,000  firms.  The  government  says  many  privatised  firms  were  sold  to  allies  of  the  last  administration  at  rock-bottom  prices.  More  than  90,000  businesses  in  all,  from  massive  corporations  to  tiny  shopfronts,  have  been  sold  off  since  1992,  as  the  command  economy  built  up  when  Ukraine  was  part  of  the  Soviet  Union  was  dismantled.  |||    Ms  Tymoshenko  said  prosecutors  had  drawn  up  a  list  of  more  than  3,000  businesses  which  were  to  be  reviewed.  ""We  will  return  to  the  state  that  which  was  illegally  put  into  private  hands.""  |||    A  day  earlier,  Mr  Yushchenko  -  keen  to  reassure  potential  investors  -  had  said  only  30  to  40  top  firms  would  be  targeted.  The  list  ""will  be  limited  and  final,  and  will  not  be  extended  after  its  completion"",  he  said.  An  open-ended  list  could  further  damage  outside  investors'  fragile  faith  in  Ukraine,  said  Stuart  Hensel  of  the  Economist  Intelligence  Unit.  But  the  government  seemed  keen  not  to  make  the  review  look  like  the  kind  of  wholesale  renationalisation  which  many  fear  in  Russia,  Mr  Hensel  said.  As  a  result,  it  was  planning  to  resell  rather  than  keep  firms  in  state  hands.  ""They're  aware  of  the  need  not  to  scare  investors,  and  to  be  careful  of  internal  divides  within  Ukraine,""  he  said.  ""They  don't  want  to  be  seen  to  be  transferring  assets  from  one  set  of  oligarchs  to  a  new  set.""  Foreign  investment  in  Ukraine,  at  about  $40  a  head  in  2004,  is  one  of  the  lowest  among  ex-Soviet  states.  |||    Mr  Yushchenko  became  president  after  two  elections  in  December,  the  first  of  which  was  annulled  amid  allegations  of  voting  irregularities  and  massive  street  protests.  |||    His  opponent,  Viktor  Yanukovich,  still  has  huge  support  in  the  country's  eastern  industrial  heartland.  Mr  Yushchenko's  administration  has  accused  its  predecessor,  led  by  ex-President  Leonid  Kuchma,  of  corruption.  The  privatisation  review's  number  one  target  is  a  steel  mill  sold  to  a  consortium  which  included  Viktor  Pinchuk,  Mr  Kuchma's  son-in-law,  for  $800m  (£424m)  despite  higher  bids  from  several  foreign  groups.  The  mill,  Krivorizhstal,  is  one  of  the  world's  most  profitable.  ""We  say  Krivorizhstal  was  stolen,  and  at  any  cost  we  will  return  it  to  the  state,""  Mr  Yushchenko  told  an  investors'  conference  in  Kiev.  |||    One  of  the  jilted  bidders,  Netherlands-based  group  LNM,  said  it  welcomed  the  possibility  that  the  mill  might  be  back  on  the  market.  |||    ""If  the  original  privatisation  is  annulled  and  a  new  tender  issued,  then  we  would  look  at  it  with  great  interest,""  a  spokesman  told  BBC  News.  A  resale  of  Krivorizhstal  could  potentially  triple  the  price,  according  to  the  Economist  Intelligence  Unit's  Mr  Hensel.  But  he  warned  that  the  government  could  decide  to  take  the  easy  route  of  revaluing  the  company  and  charging  the  existing  owners  the  revised  price  rather  than  undertaking  a  fresh  sale.  ""That  way,  Mr  Yushchenko  can  go  to  the  public  and  say  he  has  forced  the  oligarchs  to  play  by  the  rules,""  he  told  BBC  News." 

0	"UK  firm  faces  Venezuelan  land  row  |||    Venezuelan  authorities  have  said  they  will  seize  land  owned  by  a  British  company  as  part  of  President  Chavez's  agrarian  reform  programme.  |||    Officials  in  Cojedes  state  said  on  Friday  that  farmland  owned  by  a  subsidiary  of  the  Vestey  Group  would  be  taken  and  used  to  settle  poor  farmers.  The  government  is  cracking  down  on  so-called  latifundios,  or  large  rural  estates,  which  it  says  are  lying  idle.  The  Vestey  Group  said  it  had  not  been  informed  of  any  planned  seizure.  |||    The  firm,  whose  Agroflora  subsidiary  operates  13  farms  in  Venezuela,  insisted  that  it  had  complied  fully  with  Venezuelan  law.  Prosecutors  in  the  south  of  the  country  have  targeted  Hato  El  Charcote,  a  beef  cattle  ranch  owned  by  Agroflora.  According  to  Reuters,  they  plan  to  seize  12,900  acres  (5,200  hectares)  from  the  32,000  acre  (13,000  hectare)  farm.  |||    Officials  claim  that  Agroflora  does  not  possess  valid  documents  proving  its  ownership  of  the  land  in  question.  They  also  allege  that  areas  of  the  ranch  are  not  being  used  for  any  form  of  active  production.  ""The  legal  boundaries  did  not  match  up  with  the  actual  boundaries  and  there  is  surplus,""  state  prosecutor  Alexis  Ortiz  told  Reuters.  ""As  a  consequence  the  government  has  taken  action.""  |||    Controversial  reforms  passed  in  2001  give  the  government  the  right  to  take  control  of  private  property  if  it  is  declared  idle  or  ownership  cannot  be  traced  back  to  the  19th  Century.  |||    Critics  say  the  powers  -  which  President  Chavez  argues  are  needed  to  help  the  country's  poorest  citizens  and  develop  the  Venezuelan  economy  -  trample  all  over  private  property  rights.  The  Vestey  Group  said  it  had  owned  the  land  since  1920  and  would  co-operate  fully  with  the  authorities.  But  a  spokesman  added:  ""Agroflora  is  absolutely  confident  that  what  it  has  submitted  will  demonstrate  the  legality  of  its  title  to  the  land.""  The  company  pointed  out  that  the  farm,  which  employs  300  workers,  provides  meat  solely  for  the  Venezuelan  market.  |||    Last  month,  the  government  said  it  had  identified  more  than  500  idle  farms  and  had  yet  to  consider  the  status  of  a  further  40,000.  The  authorities  said  landowners  whose  titles  were  in  order  and  whose  farms  were  productive  had  ""nothing  to  fear"".  Under  President  Chavez,  the  Venezuelan  government  has  steadily  expanded  the  state's  involvement  in  the  country's  economy.  It  recently  said  all  mining  contracts  involving  foreign  firms  would  be  examined  to  ensure  they  provided  sufficient  economic  benefits  to  the  state." 

3	"Hodgson  relishes  European  clashes  |||    Former  Blackburn  boss  Roy  Hodgson  says  the  Premiership  should  follow  the  rest  of  Europe  and  have  a  winter  break  -  but  insists  that  a  gruelling  domestic  schedule  will  not  damage  the  English  elite's  bid  for  Champions  League  glory.  |||    Hodgson  -  now  in  charge  at  Viking  Stavanger  -  was  at  Liverpool's  clash  with  Bayer  Leverkusen  at  Anfield  on  Tuesday  as  a  member  of  Uefa's  technical  committee.  Hodgson  is  a  fierce  advocate  of  the  winter  break  employed  throughout  Europe,  although  not  in  England  -  where  the  Champions  League  contenders  have  ploughed  through  a  heavy  fixture  list.  But  Hodgson  told  BBC  Sport  that  while  he  believes  the  Premiership  should  embrace  the  idea,  he  does  not  expect  it  to  cost  the  English  representatives  in  the  last  16  of  the  Champions  League.  ""I  just  feel  it  is  very  difficult  to  say  with  certainty  that  teams  who  have  had  the  break  will  have  a  definite  edge.  ""I  am  a  fervent  supporter  of  the  break.  It  gives  players  the  chance  to  recharge  their  batteries  midway  through  the  season,  which  some  suggest  will  give  teams  an  advantage  in  the  Champions  League.  ""The  other  school  of  thought  suggests  having  a  break  then  coming  back  to  it  puts  you  at  a  disadvantage.  ""The  bigger  discussions  around  the  winter  break  should  be  to  do  with  the  nature  of  football  today,  the  needs  of  football  players  and  the  way  the  Premiership  has  developed,  rather  than  one  or  two  matches  in  the  Champions  League  in  February.""  Hodgson  believes  a  winter  break  carries  many  advantages,  explaining:  ""As  I  said,  it  is  the  perfect  chance  to  recharge  batteries.  |||    ""And  certainly  if  I  was  still  a  manager  in  England  I  would  be  supporting  any  calls  for  its  introduction.  ""In  pre-season  you  get  a  lot  of  enthusiasm  and  energy  but  by  the  time  you  get  towards  Christmas  many  players,  having  also  played  plenty  of  international  matches  for  club  and  country  and  travelled  a  lot,  find  themselves  getting  very  jaded.  ""The  break  gives  them  a  chance  to  recover  that  energy  and  enthusiasm  and,  perhaps  more  importantly,  recover  their  mental  strength  during  the  break  and  get  ready  for  the  games  ahead.  ""The  mental  side  is  by  far  the  most  important  thing.""  Hodgson  added:  ""The  length  of  breaks  can  vary.  In  Italy  the  break  was  very  short.  You  just  took  Christmas  and  New  Year.  ""It  was  so  short  you  didn't  do  anything.  You  gave  the  players  a  week  or  10  days  off,  then  you  were  training  for  a  week  or  10  days  and  then  went  into  a  game.  ""If  it  is  longer,  it  is  important  those  responsible  for  physical  fitness  give  the  players  a  programme  to  follow  to  ensure  the  physical  strength  they  have  accumulated  stays  with  them.""  And  Hodgson  believes  a  winter  break  would  be  a  positive  step  in  the  Premiership.  He  said:  ""If  we  talk  about  football  at  elite  level,  which  the  Premiership  is,  then  I  would  support  a  winter  break.  ""If  you  examine  the  demands  of  the  Premier  League  and,  in  particular  on  players  who  play  international  football  for  their  club  and  country,  then  a  break  would  do  them  the  world  of  good  -  physically  and  mentally.""" 

2	"Minimum  rate  for  foster  parents  |||    Foster  carers  are  to  be  guaranteed  a  minimum  allowance  to  help  cover  their  costs,  the  government  has  announced.  |||    Payment  levels  vary  from  area  to  area,  with  some  carers  getting  just  £50  a  week  for  clothes,  food  and  other  costs.  Minister  for  Children,  Young  People  and  Families  Margaret  Hodge  said  new  plans  will  ensure  fosterers'  allowances  would  be  as  fair  as  possible.  However  local  authorities,  which  set  and  pay  the  allowances,  are  concerned  about  how  the  extra  cash  will  be  found.  About  50,000  children  live  with  foster  families  in  the  UK  and  carers  have  said  they  need  more  money  to  make  ends  meet.  |||    Ms  Hodge  said:  ""Foster  carers  must  not  be  out  of  pocket  when  meeting  the  costs  of  caring  for  a  looked  after  child  -  a  crucial  role  in  society.  ""We  need  to  make  sure  that  arrangements  for  paying  foster  carers  are  as  fair  and  transparent  as  possible.  ""Our  proposal  for  a  national  minimum  rate  shows  we  are  serious  about  creating  a  better  deal  for  foster  carers  and  about  encouraging  more  people  to  come  forward  and  consider  fostering  as  a  worthwhile  and  rewarding  opportunity.""  The  government  is  seeking  to  amend  the  Children  Bill,  which  passes  through  the  Commons  next  week,  to  establish  a  national  minimum  payment.  |||    Fostering  Network  executive  director  Robert  Tapsfield  criticised  the  existing  system.  ""There  is  just  no  logic  to  a  system  which  values  children  differently  depending  on  where  they  live.  ""And  with  a  shortage  of  over  8,000  foster  carers  in  England,  it's  not  a  sustainable  situation  to  expect  carers  to  fund  foster  care  from  their  own  pockets.""  The  charity  recommends  a  weekly  payment  of  £108.49  for  looking  after  a  baby.  In  a  survey,  it  discovered  that  rates  paid  by  neighbouring  authorities  could  vary  by  as  much  as  £100  per  week.  |||    The  Association  of  Directors  of  Social  Services  (ADSS)  said  it  agreed  in  principle  with  the  government's  plans.  Tony  Hunter,  the  organisation's  president,  said:  ""There  are  many  devils  and  lots  of  details  hidden  within  the  Government's  proposals.  ""But  ADSS  fully  supports  proper  remuneration  for  valued  foster  carers  and  looks  forward  to  working  with  ministers,  local  government  and  the  fostering  organisations  themselves  in  order  to  make  sure  a  sensible  and  practicable  policy  emerges."""

0	"UK  interest  rates  held  at  4.75%  |||    The  Bank  of  England  has  left  interest  rates  on  hold  again  at  4.75%,  in  a  widely-predicted  move.  |||    Rates  went  up  five  times  from  November  2003  -  as  the  bank  sought  to  cool  the  housing  market  and  consumer  debt  -  but  have  remained  unchanged  since  August.  Recent  data  has  indicated  a  slowdown  in  manufacturing  and  consumer  spending,  as  well  as  in  mortgage  approvals.  And  retail  sales  disappointed  over  Christmas,  with  analysts  putting  the  drop  down  to  less  consumer  confidence.  |||    Rising  interest  rates  and  the  accompanying  slowdown  in  the  housing  market  have  knocked  consumers'  optimism,  causing  a  sharp  fall  in  demand  for  expensive  goods,  according  to  a  report  earlier  this  week  from  the  British  Retail  Consortium.  The  BRC  said  Britain's  retailers  had  endured  their  worst  Christmas  in  a  decade.  |||    ""Today's  no  change  decision  is  correct,""  said  David  Frost,  Director  General  of  the  British  Chambers  of  Commerce  (BCC).  ""But,  if  there  are  clear  signs  that  the  economy  slows,  the  MPC  should  be  ready  to  take  quick  corrective  action  and  cut  rates.  ""Dismal  reports  from  the  retail  trade  about  Christmas  sales  are  worrying,  if  they  indicate  a  more  general  weakening  in  consumer  spending.""  |||    Mr  Frost  added:  ""The  housing  market  outlook  remains  highly  uncertain.  ""It  is  widely  accepted  that,  if  house  prices  start  falling  more  sharply,  the  risks  facing  the  economy  will  worsen  considerably.""  CBI  chief  economist  Ian  McCafferty  said  the  economy  had  ""slowed  in  recent  months  in  response  to  rate  rises""  but  that  it  was  difficult  to  gauge  from  the  Christmas  period  the  likely  pace  of  activity  through  the  summer.  ""The  Bank  is  having  to  juggle  the  emergence  of  inflationary  pressures,  driven  by  a  tight  labour  market  and  buoyant  commodity  prices,  against  the  risk  of  an  over-abrupt  slowdown  in  consumer  activity,""  he  said.  ""Interest  rates  are  likely  to  remain  on  hold  for  some  time.""  |||    On  Thursday  there  was  more  gloomy  news  on  the  manufacturing  front,  as  the  Office  for  National  (ONS)  statistics  revealed  British  manufacturing  output  unexpectedly  fell  in  November  -  for  the  fifth  month  in  the  past  six.  The  ONS  said  manufacturing  output  dropped  0.1%  in  November,  matching  a  similar  unrevised  fall  in  October  and  confounding  economists'  expectations  of  a  0.3%  rise.  Manufacturers'  organisation,  the  EEF,  said  it  expected  the  hold  in  interest  rates  to  continue  in  the  near  future.  It  also  said  there  was  evidence  that  manufacturers'  confidence  may  be  waning  as  the  outlook  for  the  world  economy  becomes  more  uncertain.  |||    ""So  far  the  evidence  suggests  that  last  year's  rate  increases  have  helped  to  rebalance  the  economy  without  damaging  the  recovery  in  manufacturing,""  said  EEF  chief  economist,  Steve  Radley.  ""However,  should  the  business  outlook  start  to  deteriorate,  the  Bank  should  stand  ready  to  cut  rates.""  Some  economists  have  predicted  rates  will  drop  later  in  the  year,  although  others  feel  the  Bank  may  still  think  there  is  a  need  for  a  rise  to  5%  before  that  happens.  The  Bank  remains  concerned  about  the  long-term  risks  posed  by  personal  debt  -  which  is  rising  at  15%  a  year  -  if  economic  conditions  worsen."

The  album  was  released  early  in  an  effort  to  combat  both  physical  and  online  piracy.  |||    Eminem's  album  includes  the  track  Mosh,  which  is  a  tirade  against  US  President  Bush  and  the  presence  of  US  troops  in  Iraq.  The  rapper  was  criticised  earlier  this  year  after  a  performance  on  BBC  One's  Top  of  the  Pops  in  April  led  12  viewers  to  complain  he  was  ""lewd""  and  ""offensive"".  The  complaints  about  the  star  grabbing  his  crotch  were  upheld  by  the  BBC.  ""The  performer  had  been  asked  to  tone  his  act  down  after  rehearsal  but  ignored  this  request  during  the  live  broadcast,""  a  BBC  statement  read.  ""Although  his  gestures  were  part  of  the  rap  culture,  they  had  gone  beyond  what  is  expected.""" 

2	"Housing  plans  criticised  by  MPs  |||    ""Irreversible  environmental  damage""  will  be  caused  by  government  plans  to  build  more  than  one  million  homes  in  south-east  England,  MPs  have  warned.  |||    ""Sustainable  communities""  were  being  promoted  without  a  real  understanding  of  what  ""sustainable""  means,  the  Environmental  Audit  Committee  said.  It  said  issues  like  energy  needs  and  transport  were  not  properly  addressed.  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  said  the  report  was  completed  before  new  initiatives  were  announced.  He  said:  ""We  are  working  across  government,  especially  with  our  colleagues  at  Defra,  to  create  cleaner,  safer  and  greener  communities,  while  protecting  and  enhancing  the  environment.""  |||    The  report  said  there  was  far  too  little  attention  paid  to  many  environmental  issues,  including  water,  even  though  supplies  in  parts  of  the  South  East  are  already  too  low.  Regulations  designed  to  ensure  energy-efficient  buildings  are  too  lax,  and  builders  routinely  flout  them  anyway,  it  said.  |||    Financing  for  improving  transport  was  around  one-twentieth  of  what  would  be  required.  The  report  was  a  stinging  rebuke  for  the  government  and  especially  John  Prescott's  department,  BBC  environment  correspondent  Richard  Black  said.  Chairman  of  the  Environmental  Audit  Committee  Peter  Ainsworth  MP,  said:  ""The  government's  housing  policy  is  an  alarming  example  of  disjointed  thinking  in  an  areas  where  joined-up  policy  is  crucial.  ""I  accept  the  need  to  improve  housing  supply  but,  as  things  stand,  the  principal  beneficiary  of  housing  growth  will  be  property  developers,  with  the  environment  we  all  depend  on  being  the  principal  loser.""  Points  raised  in  the  report  included:  |||        -  No  proposals  to  further  increase  housing  supply  should  be  taken  forward  without  strong  supporting  evidence.      -  The  government  should  recognise  shortcomings  of  the  Treasury's  Barker  Review,  which  said  140,000  new  homes  a  year  were  needed  in  Britain.      -  The  government  should  consider  a  ""national  spatial  framework""  for  England  such  as  those  already  in  place  in  Scotland  and  Wales.      -  The  Office  of  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  should  maximise  brown  field  development  and  housing  densities.      -  Measures  to  encourage  improved  energy  efficiency  for  existing  homes  should  be  considered  -  including  reduced  stamp  duty  for  homes  that  achieve  set  standards  and  a  clear  timetable  for  achieving  zero-emissions  homes.      -  The  government  should  make  clear  how  it  intends  to  measure  its  success  at  creating  sustainable  communities.        |||    Conservative  local  government  spokeswoman  Caroline  Spelman  said:  ""There  is  now  growing  evidence  that  John  Prescott's  buildings  programme  is  environmentally  unsustainable,  leaving  a  concrete  scar  across  the  face  of  rural  England.""" 

2	"Correction  agency  plans  dropped  |||    Plans  to  create  a  single  correctional  agency  for  Scotland  have  been  scrapped.  |||    The  Scottish  Executive  will  not  now  merge  the  Scottish  Prison  Service  with  local  authority  social  work  criminal  justice  departments.  The  National  Correctional  Agency  would  have  provided  a  'one-stop'  justice  system  but  has  been  abandoned  in  the  wake  of  stiff  opposition.  Instead,  Scottish  councils  and  the  prison  service  will  be  compelled  to  work  more  closely  to  cut  reoffending.  The  plan  was  to  ensure  offenders  were  monitored  by  the  same  body  during  and  after  prison,  preventing  many  from  being  lost  in  the  system  and  helping  more  of  them  to  stop  reoffending.  |||    Scotland's  reoffending  rate  is  high,  with  more  than  60%  of  prisoners  reconvicted  within  two  years  of  release  from  jail.  This  is  leading  to  an  ever-expanding  prison  population  and  the  executive  wants  to  tackle  the  problem.  Ministers  thought  merging  the  prison  service  with  the  council-controlled  criminal  justice  social  work  departments,  which  provide  community  sentences,  might  have  provided  an  answer.  However,  following  a  consultation  on  the  idea,  Justice  Minister  Cathy  Jamieson  has  decided  to  drop  the  plans.  Instead,  Ms  Jamieson  will  change  the  law  to  help  produce  a  closer  working  relationship  between  both  elements  of  the  justice  system.  |||    She  will  announce  the  move  in  her  Criminal  Justice  Plan  on  Monday,  aiming  to  ""break  down  the  barriers  between  what  happens  in  prison  and  what  happens  in  the  community"".  The  new  measures  will  place  a  new  statutory  duty  on  the  SPS  to  work  with  local  authorities  and  others  in  area  partnerships.  A  national  advisory  board  on  offender  management  will  also  be  created  to  advise  Ms  Jamieson  on  the  SPS's  role  and  performance  in  reducing  reoffending.  The  minister  said:  ""Better  joint  working  will  help  prisons  play  a  much  stronger  role  in  ending  reoffending  behaviour  and  in  particular  help  address  the  revolving  door  of  reoffending  that  sees  offenders  entering  prison  for  short  periods  during  which  little  is  done  to  address  the  behaviour  that  brought  them  there.  ""Communities  who  are  paying  the  price  for  this  reoffending  -  both  in  terms  of  crime  and  in  terms  of  prison  costs  -  expect  better.  ""It  costs  the  taxpayer  £35,000  a  year  to  provide  each  prison  place  and  that  cost  is  increasing.  ""Taxpayers  who  suffer  the  consequences  of  crime  also  end  up  paying  for  keeping  those  people  in  prison.  ""Therefore,  as  we  continue  to  invest  in  the  service,  it  is  only  right  that  we  seek  to  ensure  that  that  service  becomes  more  accountable  to  the  public  it  serves,  to  ministers  and  to  parliament.""" 

2	"Jamieson  issues  warning  to  bigots  |||    Scotland's  justice  minister  has  warned  bigoted  soccer  fans  that  she  wants  to  hit  them  ""where  it  hurts  most""  by  banning  them  from  matches.  |||    Cathy  Jamieson  said  exclusion  orders  are  one  of  a  series  of  measures  being  considered  in  the  Scottish  Executive  campaign  against  sectarianism.  She  praised  Celtic  and  Rangers  for  their  work  in  tackling  the  problem.  However,  the  minister  said  stopping  sectarian  abuse  associated  with  Old  Firm  matches  is  a  key  objective.  Ms  Jamieson  was  speaking  ahead  of  the  third  round  Scottish  Cup  clash  between  the  Glasgow  clubs  at  Parkhead  on  Sunday.  The  sectarianism  long  associated  with  sections  of  the  support  from  both  clubs  has  become  a  significant  target  for  the  executive.  Last  week  Ms  Jamieson  and  First  Minister  Jack  McConnell  met  supporters'  representatives  from  both  clubs  to  discuss  the  issue.  |||    They  plan  to  hold  an  anti-sectarian  summit  next  month  with  officials  from  the  clubs,  church  leaders,  senior  police  officers  and  local  authority  chiefs  among  those  to  be  invited.  Speaking  on  BBC  Radio  Scotland's  Sunday  Live  programme,  Ms  Jamieson  described  Friday's  meeting  as  ""very  productive""  and  said  putting  the  squeeze  on  the  bigots  would  be  a  key  aim.  Ms  Jamieson  stressed  that  sectarianism  has  not  been  confined  to  football  but  it  can  act  as  a  ""trigger""  for  tensions  and  violence.  Clubs  have  taken  action  in  the  past  to  ban  troublesome  fans  and  supporters'  groups  expressed  their  desire  to  ensure  that  the  game  is  no  longer  tainted  by  the  problem.  |||    Ms  Jamieson  said  the  executive  should  have  a  role  in  tackling  the  soccer  troublemakers.  She  said:  ""We  can't  get  away  from  the  fact  that  in  some  instances  some  of  the  religious  hatred  that  some  people  try  to  associate  with  football  boils  over  into  violence.  ""That  is  the  kind  of  thing  we  want  to  stop  and  that's  the  kind  of  thing  supporters'  groups  are  very  clear  they  don't  want  to  be  part  of  either,  and  they  will  work  with  us  to  try  and  deal  with  that.""  |||    Ms  Jamieson  praised  the  police  for  their  action  and  said:  ""The  police  do  want  to  identify  whether  there  are  particular  individuals  who  are  going  over  the  top  and  inciting  hatred  or  violence  -  they  will  crack  down  very  effectively  on  them.  ""We  have  of  course  already  indicated  that  we  will  consider  the  introduction  of  banning  orders  to  give  additional  powers  to  where  there  are  people  who  are  going  over  the  top,  who  have  made  inappropriate  behaviour  at  football  matches,  to  be  able  to  stop  them  attending  the  games.  ""That's  the  kind  of  thing  that  will  hit  those  kind  of  people  where  it  hurts  the  most  in  not  allowing  them  to  attend  the  games,""  she  said.  Praising  Celtic  and  Rangers  for  their  efforts,  she  said:  ""I  don't  think  there  is  any  doubt  that  we  have  seen  some  positive  moves  from  the  clubs.  ""Both  Rangers  and  Celtic  football  clubs  have  been  involved  in  working  with  the  executive  to  produce,  for  example,  an  educational  pack  for  young  people."""

Shares  in  ACC  fell  5.5%  as  investors,  who  thought  the  offer  was  underpriced,  decided  to  sell.  Meanwhile,  UK-based  firm  Aggregate  Industries  said  it  had  agreed  a  £1.8bn  takeover  by  Holcim.  |||    The  deal  with  Aggregates  will  give  Holcim,  the  world's  second-biggest  cement  maker,  an  entry  into  the  UK  market  and  boost  its  presence  in  the  US.  Peter  Tom,  who  will  remain  as  Aggregate  chief  executive,  said  the  138p  a  share  offer  provided  ""significant  value""  for  shareholders.  The  Markfield,  Leicestershire-based  company  runs  142  quarries  in  the  UK  and  the  US.

2	"Lib  Dems  target  the  student  vote  |||    Students  can  decide  the  fate  of  MPs  in  some  seats  at  the  next  election,  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  has  claimed.  |||    The  party  says  the  votes  of  students  can  win  it  27  new  seats  at  the  poll.  The  figures  assume  all  students  will  vote  in  their  university  town.  In  fact,  some  may  vote  where  the  parents  live.  The  Lib  Dems  say  scrapping  university  fees  wins  them  student  support.  But  the  Tories  would  also  end  fees  and  Labour  says  both  would  cap  people's  ambitions.  |||    The  Lib  Dems  have  named  the  14  seats  where  there  are  enough  students  to  take  the  Lib  Dems  from  second  place  to  beat  Labour,  and  the  13  where  they  could  go  from  second  to  beat  the  Tories.  Launching  his  campaign  to  win  students'  votes  at  the  London  School  of  Economics,  Mr  Kennedy  urged  students  to  ""make  their  mark"".  He  underlined  Lib  Dem  plans  to  scrap  university  fees  and  reintroduce  maintenance  grants  of  up  to  £2,000.  He  said:  ""Top-up  fees  put  students  off  university,  especially  those  from  a  poorer  background.  ""And  is  it  really  right  that  so  many  young  people  are  starting  out  in  life  with  mortgage-style  debts  hanging  round  their  necks?""  Mr  Kennedy  also  said  students  want  action  on  the  environment  and  see  the  Iraq  war,  which  his  party  opposed,  as  a  defining  issue.  |||    Labour  has  pushed  through  plans  to  let  universities  charge  fees  of  up  to  £3,000  a  year,  with  the  poorest  students  eligible  for  non-repayable  support  of  up  to  £3,000.  Ahead  of  Mr  Kennedy's  launch,  a  Labour  spokesperson  said:  ""Like  the  Tories,  the  Liberal  Democrats  would  restrict  access  to  higher  education  and  put  a  cap  on  aspiration,  closing  the  door  to  students  with  good  grades  and  restricting  their  life  ambitions.  ""They  are  committed  to  abandoning  Labour's  targets  of  getting  50%  of  18  to  30-year-olds  going  into  higher  education  and  under  Lib  Dem  plans  students  would  even  have  to  study  near  home.""  The  Conservatives  say  they  would  abolish  university  tuition  fees  and  instead  offer  large  student  loans  at  commercial  rates  of  interest.  |||    They  say  the  Lib  Dem  policy  would  leave  universities  wholly  dependent  for  their  income  on  the  ""goodwill""  of  the  chancellor.  |||    Shadow  education  secretary  Tim  Collins  is  on  Thursday  setting  out  a  new  scheme  of  vocational  grants  for  14  to  16-year-olds  to  tackle  what  he  says  are  ""crippling  skills  shortages"".  The  Lib  Dem  analysis  of  the  difference  students  could  make  to  its  election  chances  is  based  on  all  students  being  registered  to  vote  near  their  university,  not  in  their  home  towns.  Although  the  expected  5  May  election  would  be  during  term  time,  students  can  vote  by  post.  The  Electoral  Commission  and  National  Union  of  Students  are  worried  students  in  halls  of  residence  can  find  it  hard  to  register  to  vote.  Some  hall  wardens  are  reluctant  to  register  students  because  of  data  protection  fears  -  but  students  can  get  themselves  registered.  If  the  election  is  on  5  May,  voters  need  to  register  by  11  March.  |||        -  The  seats  where  the  Lib  Dems  say  student  votes  can  swing  the  election  for  them  are:  Bristol  West,  Cardiff  Central,  Leeds  North  West,  Cambridge,  Manchester  Gorton,  Sheffield  Central,  Oxford  East,  Newcastle-upon-Tyne  Central,  Liverpool  Riverside,  Holborn  and  St  Pancras,  Oldham  East  and  Saddleworth,  Manchester  Withington,  Islington  South  and  Finsbury,  Birmingham  Yardley,  Surrey  South  West,  Taunton,  Orpington,  Haltemprice  and  Howden,  Eastbourne,  Isle  of  Wight,  Dorset  West,  Bournemouth  East,  Wells,  Canterbury,  Cities  of  London  and  Westminster,  Bournemouth  West,  Westmorland  and  Lonsdale." 

2	"Research  fears  over  Kelly's  views  |||    Scientists  have  expressed  concerns  that  new  education  secretary  Ruth  Kelly's  religious  views  could  hamper  vital  scientific  research.  |||    Ms  Kelly,  who  is  Catholic,  is  reported  to  be  ""pro-life""  and  has  opposed  embryo  research.  Medical  Research  Council  Professor  Nancy  Rothwell  said  Ms  Kelly's  views  mattered  as  she  was  responsible  for  training  future  scientists.  The  Department  for  Education  and  Skills  would  not  comment  on  the  concerns.  |||    A  spokeswoman  said:  ""It  is  not  news  that  Ms  Kelly  is  a  Catholic  but  we  are  not  going  into  any  details  on  this.""  But  she  added  that  claims  Ms  Kelly  was  in  charge  of  a  £1bn  university  research  budget  were  not  true.  It  was  down  to  the  Higher  Education  Funding  Council  and  the  research  councils  to  decide  on  universities'  research  allocations.  British  law  is  open  to  the  cloning  of  human  embryos  to  create  stem  cells,  master  cells  that  can  develop  into  all  the  body's  tissue  types.  This  cloning  activity  is  not  permitted  for  reproductive  purposes  -  only  for  research  into  new  disease  treatments.  However,  it  is  controversial  because  it  involves  the  destruction  of  embryos.  |||    Professor  Rothwell,  who  is  also  vice-president  of  research  at  Manchester  University,  told  the  Times  Higher  Education  Supplement  it  would  worry  her  ""a  great  deal""  if  ministers  were  anti-stem  cell.  She  said:  ""The  views  of  ministers  in  the  DfES  do  matter  as  they  are  responsible  for  training  the  next  generation  of  scientists.  ""You  can't  have  a  higher  education  policy  that  is  at  odds  with  the  government's  science  policy.""  Head  of  developmental  genetics  at  the  National  Institute  of  Medical  Research,  Professor  Robin  Lovell-Badge,  said  he  had  witnessed  the  confused  situation  in  the  US  where  many  religious  groups  opposed  the  practice.  He  said:  ""If  someone  as  senior  as  Ruth  Kelly  is  not  going  to  favour  stem  cell  research  we  will  end  up  with  a  similarly  schizophrenic  system  in  this  country.  It  is  very  worrying.""  But  fertility  expert  Lord  Winston  said  he  thought  it  was  ""rather  good""  ministers  held  ethical  views.  Concerns  have  also  been  raised  by  ""pro-choice""  organisations  that  Ms  Kelly's  views  might  affect  sex  education  policy  in  schools.  |||    Family  Planning  Association  chief  executive,  Anne  Weyman,  said  teaching  pupils  about  contraception  and  abortion  were  key.  ""Young  people  must  be  informed  about  all  the  issues  within  sexual  health,  which  include  contraception  and  abortion.  ""I  think  it  is  very  important  that  the  government  maintains  its  commitment  to  the  teenage  pregnancy  strategy.""  Currently,  individual  schools  devise  their  own  sex  education  policies  based  on  a  framework  provided  by  the  DfES.  Ms  Kelly  has  not  set  out  her  detailed  views  on  either  issue  yet,  but  has  said  she  intends  to  put  parents  first  in  education  policy.  This  would  include  the  quality  of  teaching,  classroom  discipline  and  academic  standards  in  schools,  she  said."

Mr  Dowell  told  a  Los  Angeles  court  the  residue  may  have  come  from  Mr  Blake's  revolver,  his  gun  collection,  his  presence  at  the  crime  scene  or  police.  The  71-year-old  former  star  of  US  TV  drama  Baretta  has  denied  murder.  Mr  Blake  said  he  found  Ms  Bakley,  44,  dead  in  a  car  after  they  left  a  restaurant.  |||    He  said  he  briefly  returned  to  the  restaurant  to  collect  a  gun  he  had  left  behind  and  discovered  her  body  when  he  returned.  The  gun  he  collected  was  not  the  murder  weapon.  It  could  also  have  been  picked  up  if  he  touched  or  leant  on  the  car  when  he  found  the  body,  or  from  a  police  box  in  which  his  clothes  were  later  stored.  The  box  had  come  from  an  area  where  officers  went  after  being  on  the  firing  range.  But  Mr  Dowell  also  said  the  residue  would  have  been  present  if  Mr  Blake  fired  a  gun  that  night.  Witnesses  have  already  told  the  trial  Mr  Blake  ""stood  out  as  being  quite  nervous  and  agitated""  at  the  restaurant  before  the  murder.  The  actor,  who  won  an  Emmy  for  playing  a  maverick  detective  in  the  1970s  TV  cop  drama  Baretta,  could  face  life  in  prison  if  convicted." 

0	"Indonesia  'declines  debt  freeze'  |||    Indonesia  no  longer  needs  the  debt  freeze  offered  by  the  Paris  Club  group  of  creditors,  Economics  Minister  Aburizal  Bakrie  has  reportedly  said.  |||    Indonesia,  which  originally  accepted  the  debt  moratorium  offer,  owes  the  Paris  Club  about  $48bn  (£25.5bn).  Mr  Bakrie  told  the  Bisnis  Indonesia  newspaper  that  a  $1.7bn  donors'  aid  package  meant  that  the  debt  moratorium  was  unnecessary.  This  aid  comes  on  top  of  a  previously-pledged  $3.4bn  package.  Most  of  this  'normal  aid'  would  be  used  to  finance  the  country's  budget  deficit.  The  Indonesian  Economics  Minister  explained  that  the  money  -  $1.2bn  in  grants  and  $500m  in  soft  loans  -  was  for  the  rebuilding  of  Aceh  province,  which  was  badly  hit  by  the  tsunami  of  26  December.  Nevertheless,  one  of  Mr  Bakrie's  deputies,  Mahendra  Siregar,  told  AFP  news  agency  that  Indonesia  was  still  considering  the  offer  by  the  Paris  Club  of  rich  creditor  nations  to  temporarily  suspend  its  debt  payments.  ""What  is  true  is  that  we  are  still  discussing...  the  Paris  Club  decision  to  find  out  more  details  such  as  how  much  of  our  debt  will  be  subject  to  a  moratorium.  That's  how  far  we  are  at  this  stage,""  said  Mr  Siregar.  |||    The  19  member  countries  of  the  Paris  Club  are  owed  about  $5bn  this  year  in  debt  repayments  by  nations  affected  by  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami.  Indonesia,  Sri  Lanka  and  the  Seychelles  accepted  the  Paris  Club  offer,  which  was  criticised  by  some  aid  groups  as  being  too  little.  Thailand  and  India  have  however  declined  the  offer,  with  Thailand  prefering  to  keep  up  with  its  payments  while  India  said  it  would  prefer  to  rely  on  its  own  resources  rather  than  on  international  aid.  Putting  off  payments  may  lower  a  country's  rating  among  financial  organisations,  making  it  more  expensive  and  more  difficult  for  them  to  borrow  money  in  the  future,  analysts  said.  Separately,  the  Indonesian  government  has  said  it  will  announce  monthly  how  much  it  has  received  in  foreign  donations  and  how  it  has  spent  the  money.  Welfare  Minister  Alwi  Shihab  told  AP  news  agency  that  this  announcement  should  allay  suspicion  of  official  corruption  in  relief  operations."

A  merger  would  create  a  global  player  with  worldwide  annual  sales  of  39m  cases  and  revenues  of  A$2.6bn.  |||    Southcorp  said  Foster's  A$4.17-a-share  takeover  proposal  offered  a  ""excellent  strategic  fit""  but  undervalued  the  company.  ""Southcorp's  board  has  informed  Foster's  that  it  is  not  prepared  to  recommend  the  offer  as  it  does  not  adequately  reflect  the  strategic  value  of  the  company,""  said  Southcorp  chairman  Brian  Finn.  |||    Southcorp  said  Foster's  takeover  offer  was  ""opportunistic"".  However,  it  said  that  the  offer  may  represent  an  'opening  bid',  opening  up  the  possibility  of  Foster's  returning  with  an  improved  offer.  |||    Foster's  said  a  combination  of  the  two  companies  would  create  a  global  player  with  an  ""unrivalled""  collection  of  premium  wine  brands.  Despite  being  best  known  for  brewing  Foster's  Lager,  Foster's  is  already  one  of  Australia's  largest  wine  producers,  owning  the  Beringer  and  Wolf  Blass  brands  among  others.  ""The  combination  of  Foster's  and  Southcorp  will  transform  the  global  wine  industry  and  significantly  enhance  Australia's  competitive  position  on  the  global  stage,""  said  Trevor  O'Hoy,  Foster's  chief  executive  officer.  Foster's  spent  A$584m  on  buying  an  18.8%  stake  in  Southcorp  from  the  Oatley  family,  which  founded  the  Rosemount  Estates  business  and  later  merged  it  into  Southcorp.  Shares  in  both  companies  were  suspended  while  the  two  held  talks  about  a  deal.  Southcorp's  shares  rose  12%  to  A$4.76  on  news  of  the  offer  but  Foster's  shares  fell  3.7%  to  A$5.44."

The  agreement  is  the  latest  in  a  string  of  deals  reached  by  Qatar,  which  is  trying  to  make  itself  a  regional  leader  in  natural  gas.  US  oil  giant  ExxonMobil  signed  up  for  a  $12.8bn  deal  earlier  on  Sunday.  France's  Total  is  expected  to  join  the  ExxonMobil  scheme,  dubbed  Qatargas-2,  on  Monday,  taking  5  million  tonnes  of  LNG  a  year.  ExxonMobil  will  be  taking  some  15  million  tonnes  each  year  for  25  years  from  the  end  of  2007  under  the  deal.  Shell's  agreement,  under  the  name  Qatargas-4,  foresees  the  building  of  new  facilities  to  handle  1.4  billion  cubic  feet  of  gas,  and  7.8  million  tonnes  of  LNG  each  year  from  2011  onwards."

The  Aviator  was  declared  best  film,  and  its  star  Cate  Blanchett  won  best  supporting  actress.  But  Vera  Drake  scored  best  director  for  Mike  Leigh  while  Imelda  Staunton  took  the  hotly  contested  best  actress  award.  Jamie  Foxx  won  best  actor  for  Ray,  while  British  actor  Clive  Owen  took  best  supporting  actor  for  Closer.  The  two  actors  have  repeated  their  success  at  the  Golden  Globes  in  January.  But  big  British  hope  Kate  Winslet  walked  away  empty-handed  on  Saturday  despite  two  nominations  for  best  actress.  Celebrating  his  win,  the  Oscar-nominated  Owen  told  reporters:  ""The  whole  award  season  is  new  to  me  because  I  haven't  won  anything  before.  All  of  that  is  a  bit  overwhelming.""  Blanchett,  who  won  a  Bafta  in  1999  for  her  leading  role  in  Elizabeth,  said:  ""Winning  a  Bafta  means  an  enormous  amount  to  me.""  She  thanked  the  woman  she  played,  Katharine  Hepburn,  for  paving  the  way  for  women  to  work  in  film.  ""Thank  you  very  much,  I'm  sure  you're  pleased,  although  you're  not  able  to  see  this,""  she  said.  |||    The  Aviator  took  four  awards  in  all,  also  collecting  best  make-up  and  hair  and  production  design,  while  Vera  Drake  also  scooped  best  costume  design.  Staunton,  who  is  up  for  an  Oscar  for  her  role  in  Vera  Drake,  arrived  wearing  a  green  silk  and  chiffon  beaded  evening  dress.  ""Thank  you  very  much.  I'm  so  thrilled  and  so  grateful  and  I'm  delighted  that  the  success  of  Vera  Drake  has  boosted  sales  of  hair  nets  and  pinnies,  which  is  very  good,""  she  said  on  accepting  her  award.  Her  director  Leigh,  who  beat  Martin  Scorsese  to  the  best  director  award,  told  the  audience:  ""We  always  say  it  was  a  surprise  and  sometimes  I've  said  it  and  not  meant  it.  On  this  occasion,  given  the  other  names,  it's  a  real  surprise  and  an  extraordinary  honour.  ""It's  an  immense  privilege  to  have  been  allowed  the  freedom  to  make  as  uncompromising  a  film  as  I  think  Vera  Drake  is  and  an  epic  with  such  a  small  budget.""  Best  actor  Foxx  could  not  make  the  ceremony,  but  actress  Helen  Mirren  read  out  his  acceptance  speech.  ""I'm  honoured  and  proud  to  receive  this  Bafta.  I'd  like  to  thank  the  late  Ray  Charles  himself.""  He  apologised  for  not  being  in  London,  joking:  ""Unfortunately  I'm  stuck  driving  a  car  in  LA  at  gunpoint  and  I  can't  get  away.""  DiCaprio,  who  lost  out  on  the  best  actor  Bafta  to  Foxx,  will  face  him  again  at  the  Academy  Awards  in  two  weeks'  time.  |||    ""It's  the  first  time  I've  come  to  the  Baftas  because  it's  the  first  time  I've  been  nominated,""  he  told  reporters  on  the  red  carpet.  ""I've  appreciated  British  cinema  for  a  long  time  and  to  be  recognised  like  this  is  a  special  honour.""  Other  winners  included  The  Motorcycle  Diaries  which  took  best  foreign  film  and  best  music,  while  Eternal  Sunshine  of  the  Spotless  Mind  won  best  original  screenplay  and  best  editing.  Best  British  film  was  My  Summer  of  Love,  the  story  of  two  young  women  and  their  developing  relationship,  while  Foxx's  movie  Ray,  a  bio-pic  of  late  singer  Ray  Charles,  also  took  best  sound.  Harry  Potter  and  the  Prisoner  of  Azkaban  won  the  Orange  Film  Of  The  Year,  voted  for  by  the  public.  |||    The  Orange  British  Academy  Film  Awards  are  being  shown  on  BBC  One  from  2010  GMT." 

0	"Christmas  sales  worst  since  1981  |||    UK  retail  sales  fell  in  December,  failing  to  meet  expectations  and  making  it  by  some  counts  the  worst  Christmas  since  1981.  |||    Retail  sales  dropped  by  1%  on  the  month  in  December,  after  a  0.6%  rise  in  November,  the  Office  for  National  Statistics  (ONS)  said.  The  ONS  revised  the  annual  2004  rate  of  growth  down  from  the  5.9%  estimated  in  November  to  3.2%.  A  number  of  retailers  have  already  reported  poor  figures  for  December.  Clothing  retailers  and  non-specialist  stores  were  the  worst  hit  with  only  internet  retailers  showing  any  significant  growth,  according  to  the  ONS.  |||    The  last  time  retailers  endured  a  tougher  Christmas  was  23  years  previously,  when  sales  plunged  1.7%.  |||    The  ONS  echoed  an  earlier  caution  from  Bank  of  England  governor  Mervyn  King  not  to  read  too  much  into  the  poor  December  figures.  Some  analysts  put  a  positive  gloss  on  the  figures,  pointing  out  that  the  non-seasonally-adjusted  figures  showed  a  performance  comparable  with  2003.  The  November-December  jump  last  year  was  roughly  comparable  with  recent  averages,  although  some  way  below  the  serious  booms  seen  in  the  1990s.  And  figures  for  retail  volume  outperformed  measures  of  actual  spending,  an  indication  that  consumers  are  looking  for  bargains,  and  retailers  are  cutting  their  prices.  |||    However,  reports  from  some  High  Street  retailers  highlight  the  weakness  of  the  sector.  Morrisons,  Woolworths,  House  of  Fraser,  Marks  &  Spencer  and  Big  Food  all  said  that  the  festive  period  was  disappointing.  |||    And  a  British  Retail  Consortium  survey  found  that  Christmas  2004  was  the  worst  for  10  years.  Yet,  other  retailers  -  including  HMV,  Monsoon,  Jessops,  Body  Shop  and  Tesco  -  reported  that  festive  sales  were  well  up  on  last  year.  Investec  chief  economist  Philip  Shaw  said  he  did  not  expect  the  poor  retail  figures  to  have  any  immediate  effect  on  interest  rates.  ""The  retail  sales  figures  are  very  weak,  but  as  Bank  of  England  governor  Mervyn  King  indicated  last  night,  you  don't  really  get  an  accurate  impression  of  Christmas  trading  until  about  Easter,""  said  Mr  Shaw.  ""Our  view  is  the  Bank  of  England  will  keep  its  powder  dry  and  wait  to  see  the  big  picture.""" 

3	"Williams  stays  on  despite  dispute  |||    Matt  Williams  insists  he  has  no  thoughts  of  quitting  as  national  coach  as  a  result  of  the  power  struggle  currently  gripping  Scottish  rugby.  |||    The  chairman,  chief  executive  and  three  non-executive  directors  all  departed  in  a  row  over  the  game's  future  direction.  But  Williams  said:  ""I  want  to  make  it  clear  that  I'm  committed  totally  to  Scottish  rugby.  ""I've  brought  my  family  here  and  we've  immersed  ourselves  in  Scottish  life.  There's  no  way  that  I'm  walking  away.""  However,  he  attempted  to  steer  clear  of  taking  sides  in  the  dispute.  ""I'd  like  to  stress  that  the  national  team  is  separate  to  the  political  situation,""  he  said.  |||    ""When  you  come  to  an  undertaking  like  this  and  you  are  trying  to  make  a  difference  then  there  are  always  people  who  will  begrudge  you,  who  are  jealous  and  want  to  try  to  drag  you  down.  ""When  you  have  that  situation,  you  have  to  have  the  courage  of  your  convictions  to  see  it  through.  ""There  was  some  very  unhelpful  and  uninformed  comment  that  the  national  team  had  received  a  massive  increase  in  budget  at  the  expense  of  other  parts  of  Scottish  rugby  and  that  is  simply  not  the  case.  ""Like  all  good  coaches,  you  go  and  ask  for  an  increase.  But  we  were  told  in  no  uncertain  terms  that  the  financial  situation  did  not  allow  that.  ""The  idea  that  we  are  lighting  cigars  with  £20  notes  while  the  rest  of  Scottish  rugby  flounders  is  absolutely  untrue.  ""We  also  attracted  criticism  because  of  the  number  of  days  players  spent  with  the  national  team.  ""But  let  me  give  you  the  truth.  Our  Irish  counterparts,  whom  we  have  to  compete  with  in  a  few  days'  time,  had  70  days  together  at  the  summer.  ""They  are  currently  in  camp  now  and  they  will  have  another  21  days  in  camp  before  the  Six  Nations.  ""That  means  they  will  have  91  days  away  from  their  club  from  July  until  the  Six  Nations.  We,  on  the  other  hand,  will  have  16.  ""There  must  be  a  win-win  philosophy  and  attitude  within  Scottish  rugby  and  that  is  what  we  are  after  -  both  groups  winning,  not  competing.""" 

2	"What  really  divides  the  parties  |||    So  what  is  the  gap  between  Labour  and  the  Tories  nowadays?  |||    One  Starbucks,  one  Rymans  and  one  small  Greek  cafe  as  it  happens.  Both  parties  have  now  completed  their  moves  to  new  headquarters,  with  Labour  creating  its  election  hub  just  three  doors  away  from  the  Tories'  new  headquarters  in  Victoria  Street,  just  down  the  road  from  the  Commons.  That  should  make  things  a  little  easier  if  and  when  the  crack-of-dawn  election  press  conferences  kick  off.  Unlike  2001,  there  should  be  no  need  for  colleagues  to  have  taxis  gunning  their  engines  outside,  or  to  buy  scooters,  to  get  themselves  between  the  tightly-timetabled  events.  |||    And,  to  all  intents  and  purposes,  we  already  appear  to  be  in  that  general  election  campaign.  Certainly  the  press  conference  hosted  by  election  co-ordinator  Alan  Milburn,  in  the  rather  compact  new  conference  room  -  still  smelling  of  new  carpet  and  with  the  garish  New  Labour  coffee  mugs  as  yet  unstained  -  had  all  the  hallmarks  of  an  election  event.  |||    ""Welcome  to  the  unremittingly  New  Labour  media  centre,""  he  said.  And  I'll  bet  he  hadn't  checked  that  one  with  Gordon  Brown.  Along  with  Work  and  Pensions  Secretary  Alan  Johnson  and  Minister  for  Work  Jane  Kennedy,  he  then  went  on  to  tear  into  the  Tory  plans  to  scrap  the  New  Deal  welfare-to-work  scheme,  which  they  claimed  would  lead  to  an  increase  of  almost  300,000  in  unemployment.  And  they  ridiculed  the  claims  made  on  Monday  by  Michael  Howard  that  he  could  save  £35  billion  of  Labour  waste  and  inefficiency  to  spend  on  public  services  while  also  offering  £4  billion  of  tax  cuts.  Labour  has  come  up  with  a  figure  of  £22  billions  worth  of  efficiency  savings  so,  understandably  perhaps,  believe  Mr  Howard  must  be  planning  cuts  to  squeeze  the  extra  £13  billion.  These  figures,  based  on  the  two  parties'  own  detailed  studies,  will  be  battered  to  within  an  inch  of  their  lives  during  the  campaign.  Wednesday  was  just  the  start." 

0	"Worldcom  director  ends  evidence  |||    The  former  chief  financial  officer  at  US  telecoms  firm  WorldCom  has  finished  giving  evidence  at  the  trial  of  his  ex-boss  Bernie  Ebbers.  |||    Scott  Sullivan  admitted  to  jurors  he  was  willing  to  commit  fraud  to  meet  Wall  Street  earnings  projections.  Mr  Ebbers  is  on  trial  for  fraud  and  conspiracy  in  relation  to  WorldCom's  collapse  in  2002.  He  pleads  not  guilty.  Mr  Sullivan  has  spent  two  days  being  cross-examined  by  lawyers  for  former  Worldcom  chief  executive  Mr  Ebbers.  |||    Attorney  Reid  Weingarten  has  attempted  to  portray  Mr  Sullivan  as  a  liar  and  on  Thursday  quizzed  him  about  his  decision  to  commit  fraud  to  meet  analysts'  profit  estimates.  ""At  that  point  in  time,""  Mr  Sullivan  said,  referring  to  the  first  false  entries  in  late  2000,  ""I  knew  it  was  wrong  and  I  knew  it  was  against  the  law,  but  I  thought  we  would  get  through  it  in  the  short  term.""  Mr  Sullivan,  42,  has  already  pleaded  guilty  to  fraud  and  will  be  sentenced  following  Mr  Ebbers'  trial,  where  he  is  appearing  as  a  prosecution  witness.  Mr  Ebbers,  63,  has  always  insisted  that  he  was  unaware  of  any  hidden  shortfalls  in  WorldCom's  finances.  The  former  finance  officer  said  Mr  Ebbers  knew  about  the  improper  accounting  entries  that  were  made  between  2000  and  2002  to  conceal  soaring  expenses  and  inflate  revenue.  |||    Mr  Ebbers  could  face  a  sentence  of  85  years  if  convicted  of  all  the  charges  he  is  facing.  WorldCom's  problems  appear  to  have  begun  with  the  collapse  of  the  dotcom  boom  which  cut  its  business  from  internet  companies.  Prosecutors  allege  that  the  company's  top  executives  responded  by  orchestrating  massive  fraud  over  a  two-year  period.  WorldCom  emerged  from  bankruptcy  protection  in  2004,  and  is  now  known  as  MCI.  On  Monday,  MCI  agreed  to  a  buyout  by  Verizon  Communications  in  a  deal  valued  at  $6.75bn." 

1	"Top  of  the  Pops  leaves  BBC  One  |||    The  BBC's  flagship  pop  music  programme  Top  of  the  Pops  is  to  move  from  BBC  One  on  Fridays  to  Sundays  on  BBC  Two.  |||    The  new  programme  will  combine  with  archive  show  TOTP2,  mixing  new  music  with  footage  of  classic  bands.  The  corporation  said  the  new  show  ""aims  to  appeal  to  a  diverse  audience  of  music  lovers"".  The  move  is  the  biggest  shake-up  in  the  history  of  the  show,  which  was  first  broadcast  in  1964  and  has  always  been  on  BBC  One.  Top  of  the  Pops  was  relaunched  in  a  blaze  of  publicity  in  December  last  year  in  an  attempt  to  reverse  a  long-term  decline  in  audience  figures.  |||    The  All  New  Top  of  the  Pops  was  fronted  by  newcomer  Tim  Kash  and  was  put  together  by  producer  Andi  Peters,  who  was  brought  back  to  the  BBC  from  Channel  4  to  revitalise  the  series.  |||    About  three  million  people  a  week  were  watching  the  show  on  Fridays  -  less  than  half  the  total  it  was  attracting  in  the  mid-1990s  -  as  the  programme  went  up  against  popular  ITV  soap  Coronation  Street.  But  despite  the  relaunch  audience  figures  failed  to  rise  and  still  remain  around  the  three  million  mark.  Tim  Kash  has  since  been  replaced  as  host  by  Fearne  Cotton.  The  new  show  will  launch  in  Spring  next  year  in  an  extended  format.  BBC  Two  controller  Roly  Keating:  ""It's  an  exciting  new  era  for  Top  of  the  Pops.  We  want  to  make  it  bigger  and  better  so  that  it  becomes  the  ultimate  pop  music  show  for  music  lovers  of  every  generation.""  Mr  Keating  described  BBC  Two  as  the  ""natural  home""  of  Top  of  the  Pops.  He  added:  ""The  addition  of  Top  of  the  Pops  will  also  extend  BBC  Two's  offering  to  younger  audiences.""  |||    A  BBC  spokeswoman  said  Andi  Peters  would  continue  as  executive  producer  on  the  show.  She  said  that  issues  over  the  exact  format  of  the  programme  and  a  time  slot  were  still  to  be  decided.  The  programme  will  have  a  close  relationship  with  the  BBC  Radio  1  chart  show,  which  suggests  the  relaunched  show  may  be  transmitted  at  about  1900  on  Sundays.  ""Hopefully  the  audience  for  Top  of  the  Pops  will  find  it  on  BBC  Two.  ""We  think  that  the  new  slot  will  create  a  buzz  around  the  programme  as  for  the  first  time  viewers  will  discover  the  news  of  who  is  number  one  as  it  happens."""

He  kept  Madonna  in  second  place,  as  she  earned  $54.9m  (£29.5m)  while  embarking  on  her  global  Re-Invention  Tour.  Veterans  Simon  and  Garfunkel  were  in  10th  place,  their  comeback  tour  helping  them  earn  $24.9m  (£13.4m)  last  year.  |||    ""Prince  returned  to  centre  stage  after  a  decade  in  the  commercial  wilderness,""  the  magazine  reported.  The  singer's  2004  tour  took  $90.3m  (£48.5m)  in  ticket  sales  and  he  sold  1.9  million  copies  of  his  latest  album  Musicology.  |||    Although  she  grossed  more  than  Prince  last  year,  Madonna  remained  in  second  place  because  of  the  ""monumental""  production  costs  of  her  tour.  Heavy  metal  band  Metallica's  Madly  in  Anger  with  the  World  tour  helped  push  their  2004  earnings  up  to  $43.1m  (£23.1m).  They  were  ahead  of  Sir  Elton  John,  who  took  fourth  place  and  almost  $42.7m  (£23m)  from  performances  including  a  debut  on  the  Las  Vegas  Strip.  Other  seasoned  performers  in  the  list  included  Rod  Stewart,  whose  sold-out  shows  and  third  volume  of  The  Great  American  Songbook  covers  album  helped  net  him  £35m  (£19m).  The  highest-ranking  rap  act  in  the  list  was  50  Cent,  who  at  number  19  took  $24m  (£13m)  to  the  bank." 

1	"Fightstar  take  to  the  stage  |||    Charlie  Simpson  took  his  new  band  Fightstar  to  the  stage  on  Friday  night,  just  hours  after  officially  announcing  his  departure  from  pop  band  Busted.  |||    He  was  greeted  by  a  sell-out  crowd  at  the  University  of  Warwick.  Confirmation  of  Busted's  long-rumoured  split  had  come  earlier  in  the  day,  when  Simpson  held  a  press  conference  in  London  with  bandmates  Matt  Willis  and  James  Bourne.  All  three  band  members  stressed  that  the  break  up  was  amicable,  although  Bourne  admitted  he  was  ""devastated""  to  hear  of  Simpson's  departure.  ""This  has  been  a  really  difficult  decision,""  19-year-old  Simpson  revealed,  ""I  hope  the  fans  will  understand.""  |||    While  Simpson  declared  he  would  look  back  with  pride  on  Busted's  enormous  success,  his  focus  turned  immediately  to  Fightstar,  with  Friday's  press  conference  coinciding  with  the  start  of  the  band's  13-date  tour  of  the  UK.  Fuelled  by  this  news,  all  1,400  tickets  to  see  Charlie's  first  post-Busted  live  appearance  -  at  the  University  of  Warwick's  Student  Union  -  sold  out  rapidly.  Mike  Eccleshall,  the  venue's  Promotions  Coordinator,  said:  ""Tickets  had  been  selling  strongly  over  the  past  few  days,  but  sales  went  mad  after  the  news  broke.  We  had  completely  sold  out  by  4pm.""  |||    With  queues  outside  the  venue  long  and  expectations  high,  the  pressure  was  on  Fightstar  to  impress.  Although  many  dedicated  fans  travelled  to  the  gig  from  around  the  country,  they  faced  a  tough  crowd  made  up  chiefly  of  students,  the  average  age  of  the  audience  far  exceeding  that  of  any  Busted  concert.  Gone  were  the  screaming  girls  to  which  Simpson  had  become  accustomed.  Support  act  Brigade,  fronted  by  Simpson's  brother,  played  a  short  set  first  and  were  met  with  general  approval.  When  Fightstar  eventually  took  to  the  stage  around  11pm,  however,  a  riotous  cheer  easily  drowned  out  any  hecklers  lurking  in  the  crowd.  |||    Unfortunately,  the  band  were  initially  hindered  by  technical  teething  problems  as  Simpson's  guitar  amplifier  failed  to  work.  As  sound  technicians  rushed  to  fix  it,  other  band  members  did  their  best  to  improvise.  When  they  eventually  got  under  way,  Fightstar's  blend  of  emotionally  charged  rock  was  warmly  received.  Far  heavier  and  less  commercial  than  Busted's  chart-topping  pop-punk,  the  band  will  undoubtedly  appeal  to  a  more  mature  fan-base.  Warwick  student  Helen  Clutterbuck  admitted:  ""I  came  to  check  out  Fightstar  because  of  all  the  controversy.  ""I've  never  heard  them  before,  but  I'm  pretty  impressed.""  Less  impressed  were  fellow  students  Ryan  Crabbe  and  Gordon  Rennie,  who  observed,  ""With  Fightstar,  Charlie  has  clearly  progressed  from  Busted's  sound,  but  they're  still  not  very  inspiring.""  Fightstar  played  for  around  45  minutes,  showcasing  material  from  their  forthcoming  EP  called  They  Liked  You  Better  When  You  Were  Dead,  due  for  release  in  February."

The  Xiluodu  dam  is  one  of  30  such  large-scale  construction  projects  called  to  a  halt  because  of  a  lack  of  proper  environmental  checks.  The  Beijing  News  said  the  company  may  instead  choose  to  pay  a  fine.  The  firm  has  also  ignored  orders  to  stop  construction  at  two  of  its  other  projects  -  the  Three  Gorges  Underground  Power  Plant  and  the  Three  Gorges  Project  Electrical  Power  Supply  Plant.  |||    So  far,  only  22  of  the  30  construction  projects  targeted  by  China's  State  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (Sepa)  for  having  not  carried  out  mandatory  environmental  impact  assessments  have  complied  with  its  shutdown  order.  The  China  Three  Gorges  Project  Corp  could  now  face  a  fine  up  to  200,000  yuan  ($24,000;  £12,700).  Last  week,  it  denied  that  its  projects  violated  regulations.  ""The  Three  Gorges  Corporation  has  all  along  abided  by  the  law  and  have  built  our  projects  in  accordance  with  the  law,""  it  said.  |||    The  Sepa  order  comes  as  the  Chinese  government  appears  to  be  trying  to  cool  the  country's  booming  economy.  Previously  it  has  encouraged  construction  of  new  electricity  generating  capacity  to  solve  chronic  energy  shortages,  which  forced  many  factories  into  part-time  working  last  year.  In  2004,  China  increased  its  generating  capacity  by  12.6%  to  440,700  megawatts  (MW).  The  Xiluodu  Dam  is  designed  to  produce  12,600  MW  of  electricity,  and  is  being  built  on  the  Jinshajiang  -  or  ""river  of  golden  sand""  as  the  upper  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  are  known.  It  is  a  sister  project  to  the  main  Three  Gorges  Dam  downstream  where  more  than  half  a  million  people  have  had  to  be  relocated,  drawing  criticism  from  environmental  groups  and  overseas  human  rights  activists."

They  will  join  A-list  singers  Madonna,  Sir  Elton  John,  Nelly  and  Usher  plus  actors  Kevin  Spacey,  Halle  Berry  and  George  Clooney  on  the  NBC  broadcast.  Viewers  will  be  urged  to  phone  in  to  make  donations  throughout  the  night.  Norah  Jones,  Diana  Ross,  Stevie  Wonder,  Maroon  5,  Mary  J  Blige  and  Eric  Clapton  will  give  musical  performances  on  the  show  described  as  ""A  Concert  of  Hope"".  |||    Catherine  Zeta  Jones,  Michael  Douglas,  Bruce  Willis,  Uma  Thurman,  Matt  Damon,  Drew  Barrymore  and  Tim  Robbins  are  among  the  other  movie  superstars  due  to  put  in  an  appearance.  George  Clooney  recently  reacted  angrily  to  a  TV  host's  suggestion  that  not  all  funds  raised  would  go  towards  tsunami  relief.  Fox  TV's  Bill  O'Reilly  said  he  would  be  ""watching  to  see  if  the  money  gets  to  the  tsunami  victims""  and  warned  the  celebrities  taking  part  ""had  better  be  involved  all  the  way  down  the  line"".  But  Clooney  accused  O'Reilly  of  creating  a  fuss  for  his  own  personal  gain,  saying  viewers  may  now  be  ""afraid  that  their  money  will  do  no  good"".  |||    He  urged  O'Reilly  to  co-present  the  TV  special,  adding  in  a  letter:  ""We're  not  playing  games  here,  we're  trying  to  save  lives.  It's  as  simple  as  this  -  you're  either  with  this  joint  effort  or  against  it.""  Organisers  say  all  funds  will  go  to  the  American  Red  Cross.  The  commercial-free  benefit  show  will  also  be  aired  by  a  string  of  cable  broadcasters  and  Clear  Channel's  radio  stations  across  the  US.  In  addition,  performances  will  be  available  to  buy  on  the  internet  as  downloads  from  Sony's  Connect  music  store.  A  similar  TV  benefit  carried  by  all  four  primary  US  TV  networks  after  the  11  September  terror  attacks  raised  more  than  $150m  (£80m).  |||        -  The  Bangkok  International  Film  Festival  got  under  way  on  Thursday  in  the  Thai  capital  in  the  shadow  of  the  country's  5,300  deaths  from  the  tsunami.  The  red  carpet  gala  opening  night  was  ditched  in  favour  of  a  more  subdued  first  night.  Six  different  films  were  shown  at  six  cinemas,  with  all  money  from  ticket  sales  going  to  charity."

Allied  Domecq  shares  in  London  rose  4%  by  1200  GMT,  while  Pernod  shares  in  Paris  slipped  1.2%.  Pernod  said  it  was  seeking  acquisitions  but  refused  to  comment  on  specifics.  |||    Pernod's  last  major  purchase  was  a  third  of  US  giant  Seagram  in  2000,  the  move  which  propelled  it  into  the  global  top  three  of  drinks  firms.  The  other  two-thirds  of  Seagram  was  bought  by  market  leader  Diageo.  In  terms  of  market  value,  Pernod  -  at  7.5bn  euros  ($9.7bn)  -  is  about  9%  smaller  than  Allied  Domecq,  which  has  a  capitalisation  of  £5.7bn  ($10.7bn;  8.2bn  euros).  Last  year  Pernod  tried  to  buy  Glenmorangie,  one  of  Scotland's  premier  whisky  firms,  but  lost  out  to  luxury  goods  firm  LVMH.  Pernod  is  home  to  brands  including  Chivas  Regal  Scotch  whisky,  Havana  Club  rum  and  Jacob's  Creek  wine.  Allied  Domecq's  big  names  include  Malibu  rum,  Courvoisier  brandy,  Stolichnaya  vodka  and  Ballantine's  whisky  -  as  well  as  snack  food  chains  such  as  Dunkin'  Donuts  and  Baskin-Robbins  ice  cream.  The  WSJ  said  that  the  two  were  ripe  for  consolidation,  having  each  dealt  with  problematic  parts  of  their  portfolio.  Pernod  has  reduced  the  debt  it  took  on  to  fund  the  Seagram  purchase  to  just  1.8bn  euros,  while  Allied  has  improved  the  performance  of  its  fast-food  chains."

The  economy  is  benefiting  from  a  quieter  period  in  Palestinian-Israeli  violence  and  a  pick-up  in  global  demand  for  technology  products.  The  outlook  is  better  than  it  has  been  for  a  number  of  years,  analysts  said.  |||    Many  companies  have  focused  on  cost  cutting  and  greater  efficiency,  while  the  government  has  been  trying  to  trim  public  spending  and  push  through  reforms.  The  growth  figures  come  about  despite  a  strike  earlier  this  year  by  about  400,000  public  sector  worker  which  closed  banks,  hospitals,  postal  services  and  transport  facilities.  Growth  did  slow  in  the  second  half,  but  only  slightly.  Exports  for  the  year  rose  by  14%,  while  tourist  revenues  were  up  by  30%.  Imports  gained  by  13%,  signalling  that  domestic  demand  has  picked  up  again.  In  2003,  imports  declined  by  1.8%.  In  2003,  the  economy  expanded  by  1.3%"

Depending  on  how  much  they  borrow  or  invest,  members  earn  ""reward""  points  which  entitle  them  to  a  share  of  the  society's  profits.  The  payouts  are  bigger  than  last  year,  because  of  stricter  eligibility  rules.  Last  year,  Britannia  members  shared  £42m,  but  the  average  payment  was  only  £38.  |||    To  qualify  for  this  year's  payment,  customers  must  have  been  members  for  at  least  two  years  on  31  December  2004.  Britannia  has  also  stopped  making  payments  to  members  if  they  are  worth  less  than  £5.  |||    To  qualify  for  the  profit  share,  members  must  have  either  a  mortgage,  or  an  investment  account  other  than  a  deposit  account.

Britannia  will  unveil  its  results  on  Wednesday." 

2	"Blair  sets  date  for  Africa  report  |||    The  Commission  for  Africa's  report  will  be  released  on  11  March  -  Comic  Relief  day,  Tony  Blair  has  said.  |||    July's  G8  summit  in  Gleneagles  in  Perthshire  -  chaired  by  the  prime  minister  -  will  use  the  report  as  the  basis  for  talks  on  Africa.  The  announcement  followed  the  final  meeting  of  the  commission  -  which  includes  singer  Bob  Geldof  -  in  London.  As  well  as  more  aid,  fairer  trade  and  less  debt,  the  commission  is  likely  to  demand  action  on  corruption  in  Africa.  Mr  Blair  told  a  news  conference:  ""It  will  be  a  report  that's  brutally  frank  about  the  reality,  but  I  hope  idealistic  about  what  can  be  done  if  the  will  is  there.  ""It's  an  ambitious  project  we  have  set  ourselves  and  you  will  have  to  judge  on  its  outcome  when  we  publish  it.""  |||    Mr  Blair  has  vowed  to  put  Africa  at  the  top  of  his  agenda  during  his  time  at  the  helm  of  the  G8.  He  acknowledged  he  would  have  a  ""a  job  of  persuading  to  do""  on  other  nations  to  get  the  necessary  commitment  to  debt  relief.  Bob  Geldof,  in  characteristically  blunt  style,  promised  that  the  commission  would  not  just  be  a  talking  shop  but  would  deliver  radical  new  thinking  to  change  direction  for  Africa.  The  former  rock  star's  presence  on  the  commission  has  been  interpreted  as  a  sign  that  it  will  be  uncompromising  in  its  demands.  The  people  involved  include  two  African  government  leaders  and  a  range  of  other  African  politicians,  as  well  as  experts  from  some  other  developed  countries." 

2	"Hunt  ban  support  is  'in  decline'  |||    Support  for  a  ban  on  hunting  has  fallen  in  the  past  six  years,  a  poll  suggests.  |||    Less  than  half  the  UK  wants  a  ban  compared  to  almost  two-thirds  in  1999,  the  Mori  survey  of  2,000  adults  for  BBC  One's  Countryfile  programme  suggests.  The  number  opposed  to  a  ban  remains  constant,  but  those  ""neither  supporting  nor  opposing""  has  increased  by  11%.  Most  city-dwellers  support  the  ban  but  rural  people  were  evenly  split  between  supporters,  opponents  and  undecided.  |||    Polling  company  Mori  carried  out  both  surveys.  In  July  1999  they  asked  801  adults  if  they  supported  the  ban  for  the  Mail  on  Sunday.  For  Countryfile  they  asked  2,234  adults  across  the  country  the  same  question.  The  Mail  on  Sunday  survey  found  that  63%  supported  a  hunting  ban  compared  with  24%  against.  In  the  Countryfile  survey,  47%  said  they  supported  the  legislation,  with  26%  against.  But  the  programme  makers  suggest  the  British  public  are  becoming  ""increasingly  neutral""  to  the  issue  because  around  one  quarter  said  they  ""neither  support  nor  oppose""  a  ban." 

2	"Teenagers  to  be  allowed  to  be  MPs  |||    Teenagers  will  be  able  to  become  MPs  under  plans  unveiled  by  ministers.  |||    In  a  written  statement,  Constitutional  Affairs  Minister  Christopher  Leslie  said  the  current  minimum  age  of  21  for  an  MP  would  be  reduced  to  18.  The  proposals  follow  a  recommendation  last  year  by  elections  watchdog  the  Electoral  Commission.  ""The  government  intends  to  legislate,  when  parliamentary  time  allows,  to  lower  the  age,""  said  Mr  Leslie,  who  was  elected  in  1997  at  the  age  of  24.  Even  if  the  move  does  go  ahead  it  is  unlikely  it  will  be  in  place  before  the  next  general  election,  widely  predicted  for  May.  |||    The  announcement  from  Mr  Leslie  -  who  was  elected  in  1997  in  a  formerly  safe  Tory  seat  -  prompted  calls  for  a  lowering  of  the  voting  age  to  16.  The  Votes  at  16  alliance  said  it  was  a  good  thing  to  ""engage  people""  by  lowering  the  candidacy  age  but  argued  lowering  the  voting  age  would  be  much  more  effective.  ""Candidacy  affects  only  politicians.  The  voting  age  affects  millions  of  younger  people,""  said  spokesman  Alex  Folkes.  ""We  would  hope  that  the  government  will  table  a  bill  that  is  broad  enough  to  allow  for  amendments  to  be  brought  to  test  support  for  a  reduction  in  the  voting  age.""  |||    Currently  candidates  in  both  local  and  national  votes  must  be  21  while  the  voting  age  is  18.  That  is  because  the  age  of  majority  was  reduced  to  18  in  1969  but  laws  dating  from  1695  which  determine  the  current  voting  age  stayed  in  place.  Irish  republican  Bernadette  Devlin  was  one  of  just  a  handful  of  21-year-olds  elected  to  Parliament  in  the  20th  century  winning  a  seat  in  1969.  But  the  youngest  is  understood  to  have  been  Tory  Edward  Turnour,  who  won  the  1904  Horsham  by-election  aged  21  and  144  days  and  served  in  Parliament  for  47  continuous  years.  Last  April's  report  by  the  Electoral  Commission  said  there  was  no  strong  argument  for  leaving  the  age  for  standing  for  election  at  21.  The  commission  found  the  most  common  approach  around  the  world  is  for  the  voting  age  to  be  the  same  as  the  candidacy  age." 

2	"Talks  aim  to  avert  pension  strike  |||    Talks  aimed  at  averting  a  series  of  national  strikes  over  pensions  reforms  will  take  place  this  weekend.  |||    Five  public  sector  unions  will  hold  private  talks  with  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  at  Labour's  spring  conference  in  Gateshead.  They  want  the  government  to  withdraw  regulations  -  due  to  be  introduced  in  weeks  -  which  would  raise  the  pension  age  for  council  workers  from  60  to  65.  Up  to  1.4m  workers  could  take  part  in  a  strike  already  earmarked  for  23  March.  However,  all  sides  are  anxious  to  avoid  a  major  confrontation  in  the  run  up  to  the  general  election,  said  BBC  labour  affairs  correspondent  Stephen  Cape.  In  four  days,  Britain's  biggest  union  Unison  will  start  balloting  800,000  local  government  workers  on  strikes.  Other  public  sector  unions  have  pledged  to  follow.  It  is  just  weeks  before  new  regulations  are  introduced  to  raise  the  pension  age  of  local  government  workers.  |||    The  five  unions  meeting  Mr  Prescott  want  the  government  to  withdraw  these  regulations.  This  would  allow  months  of  tough  negotiations  to  follow,  said  our  correspondent.  But  a  spokesman  for  Mr  Prescott  warned  that  the  changes  to  the  local  government  pension  scheme  would  have  to  go  ahead  in  April.  Privately  ministers  believe  this  will  be  the  ""less  painful""  option,  our  correspondent  added.  The  Public  and  Commercial  Services  Union  (PCS)  will  co-ordinate  any  industrial  action  with  up  to  six  other  public  sector  unions.  PCS  leader  Mark  Serwotka  warned  last  week  that  there  could  be  further  walkouts  unless  there  was  a  government  rethink.  ""For  a  government  that  lectures  everyone  on  choice  -  choice  on  public  service,  choice  on  this  and  choice  on  that  -  isn't  it  ironic  that  they're  saying  to  public  sector  workers  there  is  no  choice,""  he  said.  ""If  you  want  the  pension  you  were  promised  when  you  started  you  must  work  for  an  extra  five  years  -  that  is  working  until  people  drop.  ""In  the  20th  century,  it's  completely  unacceptable.""  |||    Unison's  800,000  workers,  the  Transport  and  General  Workers'  Union's  70,000  and  Amicus'  20,000  are  among  those  being  balloted  about  a  23  March  walkout.  Mr  Prescott  held  a  private  meeting  with  senior  union  figures  last  week.  It  is  understood  no  deal  was  offered  in  that  meeting  but  there  was  room  for  further  negotiations." 

2	"Voters  'reject  EU  by  two  to  one'  |||    British  voters  would  reject  the  European  constitution  by  two  to  one,  according  to  a  poll  posing  the  question  the  government  will  put  to  the  country.  |||    The  Daily  Telegraph  poll  suggests  that  45%  of  people  would  vote  against  the  constitution  and  24%  in  favour.  However  the  YouGov  poll,  which  questioned  1,943  British  adults  online,  found  25%  did  not  know  how  they  would  vote  if  forced  to  decide  tomorrow.  Only  51%  of  those  polled  had  made  up  their  minds  about  the  constitution.  Another  7%  said  they  would  not  vote  at  all.  The  poll  is  believed  to  be  the  first  to  pose  the  question  which  the  government  has  chosen  for  the  upcoming  referendum,  expected  in  2006.  The  constitution  will  be  incorporated  into  UK  law  if  there  is  a  yes  vote.  |||    Ballot  papers  in  the  poll  will  ask:  ""Should  the  United  Kingdom  approve  the  treaty  establishing  a  constitution  for  the  European  Union?""  The  government  unveiled  the  question  which  will  be  asked  earlier  in  the  week.  |||    The  treaty  was  signed  by  all  25  current  EU  members  in  Rome  last  October  and  is  due  to  come  into  force  in  November  2006,  providing  it  is  ratified  by  all  member  states  -  several  of  which  will  hold  a  referendum.  Critics  say  the  constitution  is  a  further  step  towards  a  federal  Europe,  but  advocates  say  it  ensures  effective  operation  of  the  enlarged  25-state  EU.  ""If  we  reject  this  treaty,  Britain  will  be  isolated  and  weak  in  Europe,""  said  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw,  after  the  question  was  unveiled.  Mr  Straw,  along  with  the  rest  of  the  Cabinet,  will  back  a  ""yes""  vote.  Meanwhile,  Conservative  shadow  foreign  secretary  Michael  Ancram  said  the  referendum  question  ""seems  straightforward"".  But  he  accused  the  government  of  trying  to  confuse  the  issue  by  putting  the  EU  referendum  question  in  the  same  bill  as  the  ratification  of  the  constitution,  when  they  should  be  treated  as  ""two  separate  issues""." 

2	"Kilroy-Silk  attacked  with  slurry  |||    Euro  MP  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  has  had  a  bucket  of  farm  slurry  thrown  over  him  by  a  protester  in  Manchester.  |||    The  UK  Independence  Party  member  was  arriving  for  a  BBC  radio  show  when  the  attacker  emerged  from  behind  a  bush.  Fellow  guest  Ruth  Kelly  MP  was  also  hit  by  the  slurry.  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  said  the  man,  who  later  disappeared,  claimed  he  was  ""doing  it  in  the  name  of  Islam"".  In  January,  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  quit  his  BBC  One  show  for  remarks  he  made  about  Arabs,  who  he  called  ""suicide  bombers"".  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk  had  already  been  taken  off  air  by  BBC  bosses  for  the  comments,  in  which  he  also  described  Arabs  as  ""limb-amputators,  women  repressors"".  The  remarks  prompted  outrage  among  Muslim  groups.  The  slurry  attack  took  place  on  Friday  as  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  and  Ms  Kelly,  a  Cabinet  Office  minister  and  Bolton  West  MP,  arrived  at  Manchester  High  School  for  Girls  for  the  recording  of  BBC  Radio  4's  Any  Questions.  |||    The  police  were  called  but  the  attacker  had  disappeared  by  the  time  officers  arrived.  They  are  treating  the  incident  as  assault.  The  programme's  host,  Jonathan  Dimbleby,  later  told  the  audience  the  MEP  had  been  covered  from  ""head  to  toe"".  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  was  still  able  appear  to  appear  on  the  show  after  being  loaned  a  change  of  clothes.  |||    He  told  reporters  he  was  ""very  angry""  and  planned  to  press  charges  if  his  attacker  was  caught.  He  said  the  man  shouted:  ""You've  offended  my  religion,  I'm  doing  this  in  the  name  of  Islam.""  ""As  I  started  to  turn  round  a  guy  tipped  a  bucket  of  farmyard  muck  over  me  and  then  threw  the  rest  of  it  over  me  and  the  car,""  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  said.  ""I  was  totally  covered,  it  was  all  through  my  clothes,  and  it  stank  to  high  heaven.  It  went  all  inside  the  car  and  splattered  Ruth  Kelly.""  A  BBC  spokesman  said:  ""He  took  his  seat  as  Jonathan  Dimbleby  was  introducing  the  show.  Fortunately  someone  at  the  school  had  a  change  of  clothes  to  let  him  have.""  Greater  Manchester  Police  said  people  near  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  had  also  been  hit  by  the  waste.  Officers  took  statements  at  the  scene,  but  no  arrests  have  been  made.  Police  say  the  suspect  ran  off  after  towards  Wilmslow  Road  after  committing  the  offence  but  is  believed  to  have  been  driving  a  red  Vauxhall  Corsa  earlier.  The  suspect  is  described  as  white,  aged  30  to  40,  with  a  ginger  beard.  Police  want  to  hear  from  anyone  who  has  any  information.  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk,  an  MEP  for  the  East  Midlands,  resigned  the  UK  Independence  Party  whip  in  the  European  Parliament  in  October,  after  criticising  UKIP  and  stating  his  ambition  to  be  leader.  However,  he  remains  a  member  of  the  party.  He  said  on  Friday  he  hoped  to  be  elected  party  leader  before  Christmas.  ""I  think  that  is  sufficient  time  for  us  to  put  in  process  what  is  necessary...  in  time  for  us  to  fight  and  have  a  significant  impact  upon  the  General  Election.""  But  a  UKIP  spokesman  said  that  would  be  impossible  under  the  party's  constitution,  which  requires  70  days  before  any  leadership  ballot  can  take  place."

The  potential  of  the  Indian  market  has  attracted  attention  at  home  and  abroad.  Beer  magnate  Vijay  Mallya  recently  set  up  Kingfisher  Airlines,  while  UK  entrepreneur  Richard  Branson  has  said  he  is  keen  to  start  a  local  operation.  |||    The  country  has  a  population  of  more  than  a  billion  people  and  many  observers  feel  that  it  is  underserved  by  airlines.  Recently  however,  the  booming  economy  has  boosted  personal  spending  power  and  helped  swell  the  middle  classes  and  the  corporate  sector.  India's  government  has  given  its  backing  to  cheaper  and  more  accessible  air  travel.  ""The  days  of  flying  being  a  symbol  of  only  maharajas  or  the  rich  are  over,""  the  minister  for  civil  aviation  Praful  Patel  said  earlier.  Infrastructure  is  being  built  to  handle  the  expected  increase  in  demand  and  on  Tuesday,  Agence  France  Presse  reported  that  a  group  led  by  Germany's  Siemens  won  the  contract  to  build  a  private  airport  near  Bangalore.  India's  airports  authority  and  the  state  government  will  own  13%  each  of  the  finished  transport  hub.  For  its  part,  Air  Deccan,  set  up  by  army  officer  and  silk  farmer  Gorur  Gopinath,  plans  to  increase  its  fleet  to  60  aircraft  within  five  years.  To  help  finance  the  expansion  the  company  may  sell  a  25%  stake  to  an  investor  for  about  $50m.  When  it  was  set  up  the  firm  offered  tickets  that  were  50%  cheaper  than  other  Indian  airlines.  It  said  it  was  basing  its  business  model  on  European  firms  such  as  Ireland's  Ryanair."

Demand  for  the  insurer's  debut  shares  was  strong  -  12  times  what  was  on  sale.  The  listing  was  part  of  the  country's  plans  to  open  up  its  insurance  market  and  boost  demand  in  the  sector.  Deregulation  is  expected  to  boost  demand  for  accident  and  damage  cover.  |||    Previously,  only  NCCI  has  been  legally  allowed  to  offer  insurance  products  within  Saudi  Arabia.  However,  the  authorities  have  turned  a  blind  eye  to  the  many  other  firms  selling  insurance.  Saudi  Arabia  now  wants  a  fully  functioning  insurance  industry  and  is  introducing  legislation  that  will  clamp  down  on  unauthorised  companies.  Policy-makers  also  want  to  make  having  insurance  more  of  a  requirement,  but  first  have  to  take  steps  to  boost  public  confidence  in  the  system,  analysts  said.  As  a  result,  NCCI  is  being  developed  as  the  industry's  flagship  firm  -  publicly-listed,  with  audited  accounts.  Saudi  Arabia  sold  7  million  NCCI  shares,  or  about  70%  of  the  company's  total  capital  last  month.  More  than  800,000  applicants  got  9  shares  each  for  205  riyals  apiece." 

0	"Euronext  'poised  to  make  LSE  bid'  |||    Pan-European  group  Euronext  is  poised  to  launch  a  bid  for  the  London  Stock  Exchange,  UK  media  reports  say.  |||    Last  week,  the  LSE  rejected  a  takeover  proposal  from  German  rival  Deutsche  Boerse  -  the  530  pence-a-share  offer  valued  the  exchange  at  about  £1.35bn.  The  LSE,  which  saw  its  shares  rise  25%,  said  the  bid  undervalued  the  business.  Euronext  -  formed  after  the  Brussels,  Paris  and  Amsterdam  exchanges  merged  -  is  reportedly  working  with  three  investment  banks  on  a  possible  offer.  The  LSE,  Europe's  biggest  stock  market,  is  a  key  prize,  listing  stocks  with  a  total  capitalisation  of  £1.4  trillion.  |||    Euronext  already  has  a  presence  in  London  due  to  its  2001  acquisition  of  London-based  options  and  futures  exchange  Liffe.  Trades  on  the  LSE  are  cleared  via  Clearnet,  in  which  Euronext  has  a  quarter  stake.  |||    Euronext,  which  also  operates  an  exchange  in  Lisbon,  last  week  appointed  UBS  and  ABN  Amro  as  additional  advisors.  It  is  also  working  with  Morgan  Stanley.  Despite  the  rejection  of  the  Deutsche  Boerse  bid  last  week,  Werner  Seifert,  chief  executive  of  the  Frankfurt-based  exchange,  may  well  come  back  with  an  improved  offer.  It  has  long  wanted  to  link  up  with  London,  and  the  two  tried  and  failed  to  seal  a  merger  in  2000.  Responding  to  the  LSE's  rebuff,  Deutsche  Boerse  -  whose  market  capitalisation  is  more  than  £3bn  -  said  it  believed  it  could  show  its  proposal  offered  benefits,  and  that  it  still  hoped  to  make  a  cash  bid.  |||    Last  week  the  LSE  said  not  only  was  the  bid  undervalued,  but  that  it  had  ""been  advised  that  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  any  transaction  could  be  successfully  implemented"".  However,  it  has  indicated  it  is  open  for  further  talks.  Meanwhile,  German  magazine  Der  Spiegel  said  part  of  Mr  Seifert's  negotiations  with  the  LSE  were  about  where  to  base  the  future  board  of  any  merged  exchange.  While  Mr  Seifert  has  suggested  a  merged  company  would  be  run  out  of  London,  the  mayor  of  Frankfurt  has  raised  concerns  that  such  a  move  could  cost  German  jobs.  Many  analysts  believe  German  Boerse  has  more  financial  firepower  than  Euronext  if  it  came  to  a  bidding  war."

Other  nominees  include  The  Guardian  news  website,  the  National  Theatre,  MTV,  the  Science  Museum  and  the  London  Stock  Exchange.  The  winners  from  12  different  categories  are  crowned  on  2  March  2005.  There  were  nearly  400  entries  this  year  -  a  third  more  than  last  year.  The  BBC  has  16  nominations  while  The  Guardian  has  three  nominations.  |||    ""This  year's  nominees  are  a  testament  to  the  creative  and  innovative  work  going  on  within  the  industry,""  said  Grant  Dean,  chair  of  the  interactive  committee.  Categories  include  interactive  TV,  film,  digital  TV,  mobile  phones  and  music.  Shaun  of  the  Dead,  Oasis'  Definitely  Maybe,  Really  Bend  It  Like  Beckham,  The  Chaplin  Collection  and  The  Day  Today  will  battle  it  out  in  the  DVD  category.  |||    ITV's  Great  British  Spelling  Test  takes  on  the  BBC's  Olympics  and  Spooks  Interactive  for  the  interactive  TV  award.

The  BBC's  iCan  site  is  up  for  the  technical  and  social  innovation  award  alongside  the  likes  of  Nottingham  University's  Uncle  Roy  All  Around  You.  In  2002,  the  British  Academy  of  Film  and  Television  decided  to  split  the  awards  into  separate  games  and  interactive  ceremonies,  to  fully  cover  the  range  of  innovation  outside  the  gaming  industry."

""Godzilla  should  thank  you  for  this  historical  and  monumental  star,""  said  Final  Wars  producer  Shogo  Tomiyama.  ""But  unfortunately,  he  cannot  speak  English,""  he  added.  Hollywood's  honorary  mayor,  Johnny  Grant,  said:  ""I  do  hereby  proclaim  this  Godzilla  Day  in  Hollywood.  |||    ""He's  loose,  he's  wild,  and  I'm  getting  the  hell  out  of  here,""  he  added.  The  premiere  of  Godzilla:  Final  Wars  at  Grauman's  Chinese  Theatre  followed  the  ceremony  on  Hollywood  Boulevard.  The  monster  was  joined  by  co-stars  including  Japanese  pop  star  and  actor  Masahiro  Matsuoka.  Director  Ryuhei  Kitamura  said  it  may  not  be  Godzilla's  final  outing,  as  it  has  been  billed.  ""That's  what  the  producers  say.  But  the  producer's  a  liar,""  he  said.  ""[Godzilla's]  been  working  for  the  last  50  years.  So,  I  think  Godzilla  just  deserves  a  vacation.""  And  producer  Shogo  Tomiyama  added:  ""So  long  as  Godzilla  can  fascinate  people,  I  believe  he  will  be  resurrected  by  new  generations  of  filmmakers  in  the  future.""  Godzilla  first  appeared  in  1954  as  a  prehistoric  lizard  woken  by  atomic  bomb  tests." 

2	"Fox  attacks  Blair's  Tory  'lies'  |||    Tony  Blair  lied  when  he  took  the  UK  to  war  so  has  no  qualms  about  lying  in  the  election  campaign,  say  the  Tories.  |||    Tory  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  was  speaking  after  Mr  Blair  told  Labour  members  the  Tories  offered  a  ""hard  right  agenda"".  Dr  Fox  told  BBC  Radio:  ""If  you  are  willing  to  lie  about  the  reasons  for  going  to  war,  I  guess  you  are  going  to  lie  about  anything  at  all.""  He  would  not  discuss  reports  the  party  repaid  £500,000  to  Lord  Ashcroft  after  he  predicted  an  election  defeat.  |||    The  prime  minister  ratcheted  up  Labour's  pre-election  campaigning  at  the  weekend  with  a  helicopter  tour  of  the  country  and  his  speech  at  the  party's  spring  conference.  He  insisted  he  did  not  know  the  poll  date,  but  it  is  widely  expected  to  be  5  May.  |||    In  what  was  seen  as  a  highly  personal  speech  in  Gateshead  on  Sunday,  Mr  Blair  said:  ""I  have  the  same  passion  and  hunger  as  when  I  first  walked  through  the  door  of  10  Downing  Street.""  He  described  his  relationship  with  the  public  as  starting  euphoric,  then  struggling  to  live  up  to  the  expectations,  and  reaching  the  point  of  raised  voices  and  ""throwing  crockery"".  He  warned  his  supporters  against  complacency,  saying:  ""It's  a  fight  for  the  future  of  our  country,  it's  a  fight  that  for  Britain  and  the  people  of  Britain  we  have  to  win.""  |||    Mr  Blair  said  that  whether  the  public  chose  Michael  Howard  or  Mr  Kennedy,  it  would  result  in  ""a  Tory  government  not  a  Labour  government  and  a  country  that  goes  back  and  does  not  move  forward"".  Dr  Fox  accused  Mr  Blair  and  other  Cabinet  ministers  of  telling  lies  about  their  opponents'  policies  and  then  attacking  the  lies.  ""What  we  learned  at  the  weekend  is  what  Labour  tactics  are  going  to  be  and  it's  going  to  be  fear  and  smear,""  he  told  BBC  News.  The  Tory  co-chairman  attacked  Labour's  six  new  pledges  as  ""vacuous""  and  said  Mr  Blair  was  very  worried  voters  would  take  revenge  for  his  failure  to  deliver.  Dr  Fox  refused  to  discuss  weekend  newspaper  reports  that  the  party  had  repaid  £500,000  to  former  Tory  Treasurer  Lord  Ashcroft  after  he  said  the  party  could  not  win  the  election.  ""We  repay  loans  when  they  are  due  but  do  not  comment  to  individual  financial  matters,""  he  said,  insisting  he  enjoyed  a  ""warm  and  constructive""  relationship  to  Lord  Ashcroft.  |||    Meanwhile  Lib  Dem  leader  Charles  Kennedy  is  expected  to  attack  Mr  Blair's  words  as  he  begins  a  nationwide  tour  on  Monday.  Mr  Kennedy  is  accelerating  Lib  Dem  election  preparations  this  week  as  he  visits  Manchester,  Liverpool,  Leicester,  Somerset,  Basingstoke,  Shrewsbury,  Dorset  and  Torbay.  He  said:  ""This  is  three-party  politics.  In  the  northern  cities,  the  contest  is  between  Labour  and  the  Liberal  Democrats.  ""In  southern  and  rural  seats  -  especially  in  the  South  West  -  the  principal  contenders  are  the  Liberal  Democrats  and  the  Conservatives,  who  are  out  of  the  running  in  Scotland  and  Wales.""  The  Lib  Dems  accuse  Mr  Blair  of  making  a  ""touchy-feely""  speech  to  Labour  delegates  which  will  not  help  him  regain  public  trust."

However,  Nestle's  profits  margins  were  helped  by  a  strong  performance  in  the  Americas  and  China.  Nestle  is  to  raise  its  dividend  by  11%  after  paying  back  some  of  its  debt.  |||    Nestle  said  that  the  strength  of  the  Swiss  franc  against  the  US  dollar,  the  disposal  of  businesses  and  challenging  trading  conditions  in  Europe  all  dented  sales.  A  poor  summer  across  the  continent  -  in  contrast  to  the  prolonged  heat  wave  in  2003  -  ""severely  affected""  demand  for  ice  cream.  Sales  of  bottled  water  also  fell,  although  chocolate,  coffee,  frozen  goods  and  petcare  products  performed  better.  |||    Elsewhere,  Nestle  said  it  had  enjoyed  an  ""exceptional""  year  in  North  America,  outperforming  the  market  in  terms  of  sales  growth.  Nestle  added  that  it  had  performed  strongly  in  Africa  and  Asia  despite  the  impact  of  high  oil  prices  and  political  instability.  Nestle's  total  earnings  before  interest  remained  broadly  flat  over  the  past  year,  despite  the  company  managing  to  boost  profit  margins.  As  well  as  increasing  its  dividend,  Nestle  plans  to  buy  back  shares  worth  1bn  Swiss  francs  ($861m;  £451m).  Looking  forward,  Nestle  forecasts  organic  earnings  growth  of  about  5%  in  2005,  although  it  warned  that  trading  would  remain  just  as  competitive.  |||    Uncertainty  remains  over  the  future  of  Perrier,  the  iconic  French  mineral  water  owned  by  Nestle.  Perrier  has  been  locked  in  a  long-standing  dispute  with  unions  about  productivity  levels  at  the  business,  which  has  lead  Nestle  to  consider  selling  the  firm.  ""The  option  of  selling  is  Perrier  is  still  on  the  table,""  chief  executive  Peter  Brabeck-Letmathe  confirmed  on  Thursday."

Commenting  on  the  diversity  of  the  nominated  films,  he  added:  ""Our  selection  committee  had  a  harder  time  than  ever  narrowing  down  the  field.""  |||    Joining  Vera  Drake  and  Dead  Man's  Shoes  in  the  running  for  best  film  are  My  Summer  of  Love,  climbing  documentary  Touching  the  Void  and  zombie  comedy  Shaun  of  the  Dead.  Geoffrey  Rush  wins  a  best  actor  nomination  for  his  role  as  Peter  Sellers  in  the  recent  biopic  The  Life  &  Death  of  Peter  Sellers.  |||    The  Australian  star  faces  competition  from  Daniel  Craig  (Enduring  Love),  Phil  Davis  (Vera  Drake),  Ian  Hart  (Blind  Fight)  and  Dead  Man's  Shoes'  star  Paddy  Considine.  Considine  is  also  nominated  for  a  best  supporting  actor  award  for  My  Summer  of  Love.

Shane  Meadows  and  Kevin  McDonald,  both  former  winners  of  the  Douglas  Hickox  Award  (for  Best  Directorial  Debut)  won  best  director  nominations.  Seasoned  film-makers  Roger  Michell,  Mike  Leigh  and  Pavel  Pavlikowsky  challenge  them  to  the  award.

Smith  has  yet  to  decide  the  line-up  for  Meltdown,  which  begins  on  11  June.  ""I  want  to  touch  on  all  aspects  of  our  culture,  perhaps  with  readings  from  Genet,  and  I  have  an  idea  for  Jeremy  Irons  to  read  Proust,""  she  said.  |||    The  58-year-old  US  singer  of  Because  the  Night  told  The  Observer  newspaper  that  the  festival  would  be  her  response  to  these  ""material,  exploitative  and  greedy  times"".  ""It  is  important  we  explore  the  new,  but  we  should  also  salute  the  best  art  there  is,  aesthetically  and  spiritually,""  she  said.  Last  year's  Meltdown  festival,  directed  by  the  ex-Smiths  star  Morrissey,  included  appearances  by  singer  Jane  Birkin,  Nancy  Sinatra  and  playwright  Alan  Bennett.

The  countries  stand  to  reap  huge  benefits  from  membership  of  the  group,  whose  purpose  is  to  promote  free  trade.  Joining,  however,  is  a  lengthy  process.  China's  admission  in  2001  took  15  years  and  talks  with  Russia  and  Saudi  Arabia  have  been  taking  place  for  10  years.  Membership  of  the  Geneva-based  WTO  helps  guarantee  a  country's  goods  receives  equal  treatment  in  the  markets  of  other  member  states  -  a  policy  which  has  seen  it  become  closely  associated  with  globalisation.  |||    Iraq's  Trade  Minister  Mohammed  Mustafa  al-Jibouri  welcomed  the  move,  describing  it  as  significant  as  November's  decision  by  the  Paris  Club  of  creditor  nations  to  write  off  80%  of  the  country's  debts.  Assad  Omar,  Afghanistan's  envoy  to  the  United  Nations  in  Geneva,  said  accession  would  contribute  to  ""regional  prosperity  and  global  security"".  There  are  now  27  countries  seeking  membership  of  the  WTO.  Prospective  members  need  to  enter  into  negotiations  with  potential  trading  countries  and  change  domestic  laws  to  bring  them  in  line  with  WTO  regulations.  Before  the  process  gets  under  way,  all  148  WTO  members  must  give  their  backing  to  applicant  countries.  The  US  said  it  could  not  approve  Iran's  application  because  it  is  currently  reviewing  relations.  But  several  nations  criticised  the  approach,  and  European  Union  ambassador  to  the  WTO,  Carlo  Trojan,  said  Iran's  application  ""must  be  treated  independently  of  political  issues""."

The  minister  also  confirmed  she  received  ""spiritual  support""  from  the  Catholic  movement  Opus  Dei.  But  she  denied  her  faith  meant  she  would  refuse  key  government  jobs.  |||    The  Conservatives  have  made  school  discipline  one  of  their  five  priority  areas  in  the  run-up  to  the  next  general  election.  Ms  Kelly  is  expected  to  announce  her  plans  on  the  issue  in  the  next  fortnight.  She  told  BBC  One's  Breakfast  with  Frost:  ""It  is  really  important  to  support  head  teachers  and  teachers  in  tackling  disruption  in  the  classroom.  ""We  have  made  huge  progress  on  the  really  difficult  cases,  the  pupils  who  have  severely  disruptive  behaviour.  |||    ""But  quite  rightly  what  teachers  are  concerned  about  and  what  parents  are  concerned  about  is  that  this  lower  level  disruption  that  goes  on  in  the  classroom  now  is  tackled.  ""I  would  like  to  see  the  teacher  being  able  to  remove  disruptive  children  from  the  classroom  completely  and  have  either  alternative  provision  within  the  school  or  indeed  off  the  school  and  may  be  working  together  with  other  schools  in  a  particular  area  to  provide  that  provision.""  It  is  thought  the  plans  may  distinguish  between  excluding  pupils  from  schools  and  taking  them  out  of  mainstream  classes.  Head  teachers  can  currently  exclude  pupils  who  commit  or  threaten  violence  in  school,  who  sexually  abuse  pupils  or  other  people,  who  sell  illegal  drugs  or  who  have  persistent  and  malicious  disruptive  behaviour.  Ms  Kelly  entered  the  Cabinet  last  month  in  the  reshuffle  forced  by  the  resignation  of  the  then  Home  Secretary  David  Blunkett.  Her  links  to  Opus  Dei,  which  means  ""Work  of  God""  in  Latin,  have  provoked  controversy.  |||    Critics  say  the  organisation,  which  adheres  strictly  to  Catholic  teachings,  is  secretive  and  elitist  but  its  members  reject  such  claims.  Asked  if  she  was  a  member  of  the  group,  Ms  Kelly  said:  ""I  do  have  spiritual  support  from  Opus  Dei  and  that  is  right.  ""But  those  are  private  spiritual  matters  and  I'm  sure  you'll  respect  that  politicians  are  entitled  to  a  private  life.""  She  categorically  denied  reports  that  her  beliefs  on  issues  such  as  contraception  would  make  her  refuse  to  serve  as  a  health  or  international  development  minister.  Her  collective  responsibility  as  a  Cabinet  minister  meant  she  also  took  responsibility  for  policies  in  those  areas,  she  argued.  |||    The  government  has  yet  to  issue  its  official  response  to  the  Tomlinson  review,  which  recommended  absorbing  existing  exam  qualifications  into  a  diploma.  Ms  Kelly  said  reforms  should  build  on  GCSEs  and  A-levels.  Her  comments  did  not  impress  Tory  shadow  education  secretary  Tim  Collins.  ""Ruth  Kelly  wants  to  ditch  the  Tomlinson  report  on  exam  structures  but  has  absolutely  no  idea  what  to  put  in  its  place,""  he  said.  ""She  also  talks  of  improving  discipline  but  cannot  make  her  mind  up  how.  This  is  an  all  talk  agenda  that  lets  down  children,  teachers  and  parents.""" 

2	"Guantanamo  four  free  in  weeks  |||    All  four  Britons  held  by  the  US  in  Guantanamo  Bay  will  be  returned  to  the  UK  within  weeks,  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  told  the  Commons  on  Tuesday.  |||    Moazzam  Begg,  from  Birmingham,  and  Martin  Mubanga,  Richard  Belmar  and  Feroz  Abbasi,  from  London,  have  been  held  by  the  US  for  almost  three  years.  They  were  detained  in  the  Cuban  camp  as  part  of  the  US-led  ""war  on  terror"".  Mr  Straw  said  the  US  had  agreed  to  release  the  four  after  ""intensive  and  complex  discussions""  over  security.  He  said  the  government  had  been  negotiating  the  return  of  the  detainees  since  2003.  All  four  families  have  been  informed  of  their  return  and  have  been  involved  in  regular  discussions  with  the  government,  Mr  Straw  said.  |||    But  he  added:  ""Once  they  are  back  in  the  UK,  the  police  will  consider  whether  to  arrest  them  under  the  Terrorism  Act  2000  for  questioning  in  connection  with  possible  terrorist  activity.""  The  shadow  foreign  secretary,  Michael  Ancram,  welcomed  the  return  of  the  four  detainees.  But  he  said  there  were  still  ""serious  questions""  both  over  the  possible  threat  the  four  pose  to  the  UK,  and  the  treatment  they  received  while  detained.  Liberal  Democrat  foreign  affairs  spokesman  Sir  Menzies  Campbell  said  the  four  had  been  rescued  from  a  ""legal  no-man's  land"".  ""Their  civil  rights  were  systematically  and  deliberately  abused  and  they  were  denied  due  process.""  |||    Azmat  Begg,  father  of  Moazzam,  thanked  his  lawyers  and  the  British  people  for  the  support  he  had  received  while  campaigning  for  his  son's  release.  He  added:  ""If  they  have  done  something  wrong,  of  course  they  should  be  punished,  but  if  they  haven't,  they  shouldn't  have  been  there.""  Lawyer  Louise  Christian,  who  represents  Mr  Abbasi  and  Mr  Mubanga,  said  the  government  should  have  acted  sooner.  She  said:  ""They  should  at  the  outset  have  said  quite  clearly  to  the  American  government  that  they  were  behaving  in  breach  of  international  law  and  that  the  British  government  wanted  no  part  of  it  and  wanted  Guantanamo  Bay  shut  down.  ""They  didn't  do  that.  They  colluded  with  it.""  Moazzam  Begg's  Labour  MP  Roger  Godsiff  welcomed  his  release,  but  said  questions  remained  unanswered,  particularly  about  charges.  Asked  about  possible  damages  Mr  Begg  and  the  other  detainees  could  bring  against  the  US,  Mr  Godsiff  said:  ""People  get  released  from  prison  when  it's  found  that  their  prosecution  was  unsustainable  and  they  are  quite  rightly  awarded  sizeable  sums  of  money.  ""I  don't  see  any  difference  in  this  case.""  Human  rights  campaigners  have  been  outraged  at  the  treatment  of  the  detainees  in  Cuba.  Amnesty  International  has  called  Camp  Delta  a  ""major  human-rights  scandal""  and  an  ""icon  of  lawlessness"".  Both  Amnesty  and  the  lobby  group  Guantanamo  Human  Rights  Commission  described  the  release  as  ""long  overdue"".  Civil  rights  group  Liberty  said  it  was  ""delighted""  but  called  on  the  government  to  release  men  indefinitely  detained  in  the  UK  without  charge  or  trial.  |||    Director  Shami  Chakrabarti  called  on  the  government  to  ""practise  what  it  preaches""  and  either  free  or  charge  12  detainees  at  Belmarsh  and  Woodhill  prisons.  Law  Lords  ruled  last  month  that  the  12  were  being  held  in  contravention  of  human  rights  laws  but  they  are  still  behind  bars.  The  US  has  also  announced  that  48-year-old  Australian  Mamdouh  Habib,  previously  accused  of  terrorist  offences,  will  be  released  without  charge  from  Camp  Delta.  Five  British  detainees  released  from  Guantanamo  in  March  last  year  were  questioned  by  UK  police  before  being  released  without  charge." 

0	"Bush  budget  seeks  deep  cutbacks  |||    President  Bush  has  presented  his  2006  budget,  cutting  domestic  spending  in  a  bid  to  lower  a  record  deficit  projected  to  peak  at  $427bn  (£230bn)  this  year.  |||    The  $2.58  trillion  (£1.38  trillion)  budget  submitted  to  Congress  affects  150  domestic  programmes  from  farming  to  the  environment,  education  and  health.  But  foreign  aid  is  due  to  rise  by  10%,  with  more  money  to  treat  HIV/Aids  and  reward  economic  and  political  reform.  Military  spending  is  also  set  to  rise  by  4.8%,  to  reach  $419.3bn.  The  budget  does  not  include  the  cost  of  running  military  operations  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan,  for  which  the  administration  is  expected  to  seek  an  extra  $80bn  from  Congress  later  this  year.  |||    Congress  will  spend  several  months  debating  George  W  Bush's  proposal.  |||    The  state  department's  planned  budget  would  rise  to  just  under  $23bn  -  a  fraction  of  the  defence  department's  request  -  including  almost  $6bn  to  assist  US  allies  in  the  ""war  on  terror"".  However,  the  administration  is  keen  to  highlight  its  global  effort  to  tackle  HIV/Aids,  the  BBC's  Jonathan  Beale  reports,  and  planned  spending  would  almost  double  to  $3bn,  with  much  of  that  money  going  to  African  nations.  Mr  Bush  also  wants  to  increase  the  amount  given  to  poorer  countries  through  his  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation.  The  scheme  has  been  set  up  to  reward  developing  countries  that  embrace  what  the  US  considers  to  be  good  governance  and  sound  policies.  Yet  Mr  Bush's  proposed  spending  of  $3bn  on  that  project  is  well  below  his  initial  promise  of  $5bn.  |||    A  key  spending  line  missing  from  proposals  is  the  cost  of  funding  the  administration's  proposed  radical  overhaul  of  Social  Security,  the  pensions  programme  on  which  many  Americans  rely  for  their  retirement  income.  |||    Some  experts  believe  this  could  require  borrowing  of  up  to  $4.5  trillion  over  a  20-year  period.  Neither  does  the  budget  include  any  cash  to  purchase  crude  oil  for  the  US  emergency  petroleum  stockpile.  Concern  over  the  level  of  the  reserve,  created  in  1970s,  has  led  to  rises  in  oil  prices  over  the  past  year.  The  Bush  administration  will  instead  continue  to  fill  the  reserve  by  taking  oil  -  rather  than  cash  -  from  energy  companies  that  drill  under  federal  leases.  |||    The  outline  proposes  reductions  in  budgets  at  12  out  of  23  government  agencies  including  cuts  of  9.6%  at  Agriculture  and  5.6%  at  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency.  The  spending  plan  for  the  year  beginning  1  October  is  banking  on  a  healthy  US  economy  to  boost  government  income  by  6.1%  to  $2.18  trillion.  Spending  is  forecast  to  grow  by  3.5%  to  $2.57  trillion.  But  the  budget  is  still  the  tightest  yet  under  Mr  Bush's  presidency.  ""In  order  to  sustain  our  economic  expansion,  we  must  continue  pro-growth  policies  and  enforce  even  greater  spending  restraint  across  federal  government,""  Mr  Bush  said  in  his  budget  message  to  Congress.  Mr  Bush  has  promised  to  halve  the  US's  massive  budget  deficit  within  five  years.  The  deficit,  partly  the  result  of  massive  tax  cuts  early  in  Mr  Bush's  presidency,  has  been  a  key  factor  in  pushing  the  US  dollar  lower.  The  independent  Congressional  Budget  Office  estimates  that  the  shortfall  could  shrink  to  little  more  than  $200bn  by  2009,  returning  to  the  surpluses  seen  in  the  late  1990s  by  2012.  But  its  estimates  depend  on  the  tax  cuts  not  being  made  permanent,  in  line  with  the  promise  when  they  were  passed  that  they  would  ""sunset"",  or  disappear,  in  2010.  Most  Republicans,  however,  want  them  to  stay  in  place.  And  the  figures  also  rely  on  the  ""Social  Security  trust  fund""  -  the  money  set  aside  to  cover  the  swelling  costs  of  retirement  pensions  -  being  offset  against  the  main  budget  deficit."

Its  comments  came  after  the  industry  minister  of  India's  Andhra  Pradesh  state  said  a  team  of  VW  officials  were  due  to  visit  to  discuss  the  plans.  B.  Satyanarayana  said  he  expected  VW  to  co-sign  a  memorandum  of  agreement.  Several  foreign  carmakers,  including  Hyundai,  Toyota,  Suzuki  and  Ford,  already  have  Indian  production  facilities  to  meet  demand  for  automobiles  in  Asia's  fourth-largest  economy.  VW's  proposed  plant  would  be  set  up  in  the  port  city  of  Visakhapatnam  on  India's  eastern  coast.  An  Andhra  Pradesh  official  added  that  VW  had  already  approved  a  factory  site  measuring  250  acres." 

1	"DJ  double  act  revamp  chart  show  |||    DJ  duo  JK  and  Joel  are  taking  over  BBC  Radio  1's  flagship  chart  show  on  Sunday,  adding  showbiz  news,  celebrity  interviews  and  between-song  banter.  |||    They  hope  to  boost  ratings  for  the  long-running  show,  which  has  been  overtaken  in  popularity  by  independent  radio's  Hit  40  UK  rundown.  ""Radio  1's  chart  show  is  an  institution  and  remains  the  station's  single  most  popular  show,""  says  JK,  also  known  as  Jason  King.  ""For  years  people  have  been  tuning  in  at  four  o'clock  with  their  tape  recorders  ready  to  record  their  favourite  tunes.  Not  that  I  ever  did  that.  ""But  things  have  moved  on  a  lot  now  so  it  was  time  for  a  change.""  |||    That  change  involved  ejecting  previous  host  Wes  Butters  and  relocating  King  and  DJ  partner  Joel  Ross  from  their  weekend  afternoon  Radio  1  slot.  The  pair  have  worked  together  for  a  decade  -  meeting  on  Viking  Radio  in  Hull  before  moving  to  Manchester  station  Key  103  and  winning  two  Sony  Radio  awards.  They  also  presented  gadget  series  Playboyz  and  car  show  Motor  Maniacs  for  cable  TV  channel  Granada  Men  and  Motors,  and  Pure  Soap  on  BBC  Three.  |||    On  the  revamped  chart  show  their  cheeky,  laddish  banter  will  punctuate  star  interviews  and  competitions,  film  and  DVD  charts  plus  a  look  at  future  single  releases,  in  addition  to  the  singles  chart  itself.  ""The  chart  rundown  is  no  longer  the  only  point  of  the  programme,""  says  Ross.  ""The  show  used  to  be  the  only  way  to  discover  who  was  in  the  Top  40.  Now  you  can  just  click  on  the  internet  to  find  that  out,  so  the  show  has  plenty  of  extra  items  too.""  The  show's  reduced  reliance  upon  the  Top  40  also  reflects  the  fact  that  music  fans  are  now  more  likely  to  download  songs  in  digital  format  rather  than  buy  them  on  compact  disc,  vinyl  or  cassette.  |||    ""I  personally  buy  downloads  rather  than  CD  singles,""  says  27-year-old  Ross.  ""Even  my  grandma  can  download  songs  now.  JK  is  still  struggling  with  the  technology,  though.""  ""But  it's  premature  for  people  to  say  that  the  singles  chart  is  dead,""  Ross  adds.  ""While  sales  of  singles  on  traditional  formats  are  down,  interest  in  songs  has  been  revived  by  download  sales,  which  will  be  incorporated  into  our  main  chart  rundown  from  April.  ""Music  fans  still  want  to  know  what  is  the  most  popular  song  of  the  week.""  |||    Ross  will  be  plumping  for  chart  success  from  rapper  Verbalicious  and  the  Stereophonics  on  Sunday,  while  King  is  more  of  an  R&B  and  dance  music  fan.  ""So  listeners  will  get  the  advantage  of  both  our  music  tastes,""  says  King,  30,  who  describes  outgoing  host  Butters  as  ""an  extremely  professional  and  competent  broadcaster"".  |||    ""The  advantage  Joel  and  I  have  is  that  we're  a  double  act,  with  a  rapport  between  us  that  makes  the  show  much  more  interactive,""  King  says.  ""Wes  has  a  great  broadcasting  career  ahead  of  him.  And  if  not,  I  could  always  use  a  cleaner,""  he  jokes.  Ross  says  the  pair  have  done  their  best  to  ignore  the  weight  of  expectation  placed  upon  the  revamped  show.  ""Other  people  can  worry  about  that,  we  are  going  to  continue  doing  what  we  do  well,""  he  says.  ""At  the  end  of  the  day  this  is  a  radio  show  that  is  meant  to  be  entertaining.  Nobody  died.""" 

2	"Labour  attacked  on  Howard  poster  |||    Labour  has  been  accused  of  using  anti-Semitic  images  in  posters  which  critics  claim  depict  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  as  Fagin.  |||    The  poster  shows  Mr  Howard  hypnotising  people  with  a  pocket  watch,  saying:  ""I  can  spend  the  same  money  twice.""  The  image  prompted  concern  from  the  editor  of  the  Jewish  Chronicle  but  Labour  insists  it  is  simply  anti-Tory.  Labour  later  took  the  image  off  its  website,  saying  an  alternative  idea  had  proved  more  popular  with  party  members.  The  party  will  now  use  focus  groups  to  test  a  poster  showing  Mr  Howard  and  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  with  a  blackboard  reading:  ""2+2=5"".  |||    The  hypnotism  poster  has  been  compared  to  the  portrayal  of  the  Dickens  character  Fagin  in  the  stage  version  of  the  musical  Oliver!  There  was  controversy  over  another  poster  choice  offered  to  Labour  members.  It  showed  Mr  Howard  and  Mr  Letwin  -  who  are  both  Jewish  -  as  flying  pigs.  Mr  Howard  did  not  comment  on  the  anti-Semitism  claims  when  asked  about  the  poster  on  Monday.  Instead,  he  pointed  to  how  Tony  Blair  had  in  1997  complained  about  ""personalised  abusive  campaigning"".  Mr  Howard  told  Greater  Manchester  Radio:  ""It  is  such  a  pity  that  Mr  Blair  doesn't  practise  what  he  preaches.""  |||    Jewish  Chronicle  editor  Ned  Temko  said  there  had  been  a  mixed  reaction  to  the  first  poster  but  e-mails  from  Jewish  Chronicle  readers  showed  deeper  concern  about  the  hypnotism  image.  ""Shylock  and  Fagin  are  inextricably  linked  to  notions  of  centuries-old  prejudice,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  World  At  One.  ""Whatever  the  idea  is,  I  think  it's  a  difficult  exercise  to  use  images  like  that  and  to  argue  that  you  can  divorce  them  from  their  historical  context  or  meaning.""  Mr  Temko  said  he  blamed  ""cock-up  not  conspiracy"",  saying  he  did  not  detect  inherent  anti-Semitism  in  any  of  the  parties'  election  campaigns.  |||    The  poster  is  among  one  of  a  series  of  ideas  shown  to  Labour  members,  who  have  been  asked  to  choose  which  one  should  be  used  ahead  of  the  election.  Labour  MP  Louise  Ellman  said  the  hypnotism  image  was  insensitive  but  urged  people  not  to  rush  to  call  things  anti-Semitic  when  they  only  challenged  Tory  economic  policies.  Labour  campaign  spokesman  Fraser  Kemp  said  the  poster  had  been  misunderstood.  The  image  simply  portrayed  Mr  Howard  as  a  hypnotist,  he  argued.  ""Concern  has  been  expressed  and  clearly  we  have  to  take  those  views  on  board  but  I  would  emphasise  that  if  you  see  the  posters,  the  common  theme...  is  that  the  Tories  are  trying  to  con  you.""  A  Labour  spokesman  later  said  the  timing  of  removing  the  controversial  image  from  the  party's  website  was  not  affected  by  the  row.  ""This  has  been  up  on  the  website  for  two  weeks  and  there  has  only  been  a  fuss  in  the  last  four  days  so  a  substantial  number  of  people  voted  before  there  was  any  fuss,""  he  said.  But  a  Conservative  spokeswoman  said:  ""This  poster  campaign  -  which  was  offensive  to  many  people  -  was  a  big  misjudgement  by  Labour's  campaign  team.""" 

0	"US  insurer  Marsh  cuts  2,500  jobs  |||    Up  to  2,500  jobs  are  to  go  at  US  insurance  broker  Marsh  &  McLennan  in  a  shake  up  following  bigger-than-expected  losses.  |||    The  insurer  said  the  cuts  were  part  of  a  cost-cutting  drive,  aimed  at  saving  millions  of  dollars.  Marsh  posted  a  $676m  (£352m)  loss  for  the  last  three  months  of  2004,  against  a  $375m  (£195.3m)  profit  a  year  before.  It  blamed  an  $850m  payout  to  settle  a  price-rigging  lawsuit,  brought  by  New  York  attorney  general  Elliot  Spitzer.  Under  the  settlement  announced  in  January,  Marsh  took  a  pre-tax  charge  of  $618m  in  the  October-to-December  quarter,  on  top  of  the  $232m  charge  from  the  previous  quarter.  ""Clearly  2004  was  the  most  difficult  year  in  MMC's  financial  history,""  Marsh  chief  executive  Michael  Cherkasky  said.  |||    An  ongoing  restructuring  drive  at  the  group  also  led  to  a  $337m  hit  in  the  fourth  quarter,  the  world's  biggest  insurer  said.  |||    Analysts  expect  its  latest  round  of  cuts  to  focus  on  its  brokerage  unit,  which  employs  40,000  staff.  The  latest  layoffs  will  take  the  total  number  of  jobs  to  go  at  the  firm  to  5,500  and  are  expected  to  lead  to  annual  savings  of  more  than  $375m.  As  part  of  its  efforts  to  cut  costs,  the  company  said  it  was  halving  its  dividend  payment  to  17  cents  a  shares  from  34  cents,  a  move  which  should  enable  it  to  save  $360m.  Looking  ahead,  Mr  Cherkasky  forecast  profitable  growth  for  the  year  ahead  ""with  an  operating  margin  in  the  upper-teens,  and  with  the  opportunity  for  further  margin  expansion"".  Meanwhile,  the  company  also  announced  it  would  spin-off  its  MMC  Capital  private  equity  unit,  which  manages  the  $3bn  Trident  Funds  operation,  to  a  group  of  employees.  Marsh  did  not  say  when  the  move  would  take  place,  but  said  it  had  signed  a  letter  of  intent.  |||    The  insurer  hit  the  headlines  in  October  last  year  when  it  faced  accusations  of  price  rigging.  New  York  Attorney  General  Elliot  Spitzer  sued  the  company,  accusing  it  of  receiving  illegal  payments  to  steer  clients  to  selected  firms  as  well  as  rigging  bids  and  fixing  prices.  In  January,  Marsh  agreed  to  pay  $850m  to  settle  the  suit  -  a  figure  in  line  with  the  placement  fees  it  collected  in  2003  -  and  agreed  to  change  its  business  practices.  In  February,  a  former  senior  executive  pleaded  guilty  to  criminal  charges  in  a  wide-ranging  probe  of  fraud  and  bid-rigging  in  the  insurance  industry.  In  January,  a  former  senior  vice  president  also  pleaded  guilty  to  criminal  charges  related  to  the  investigation.  In  an  effort  to  reform  its  business  practises,  Marsh  said  it  has  already  introduced  new  leadership,  new  compliance  procedures  and  new  ways  of  dealing  with  customers.  ""As  a  result,  we  are  ready  to  put  these  matters  behind  us  and  move  ahead  in  2005  to  restore  the  trust  our  clients  have  placed  in  us  and  to  rebuild  shareholder  value,""  Mr  Cherkasky  said."

Prosecutors  said  he  was  motivated  by  wealth  -  spending  about  $200m  between  1996  and  2002  while  earning  much  less.  Defence  lawyers  said  Mr  Scrushy  had  been  deceived  by  other  executives.  Several  former  HealthSouth  employees  have  already  pleaded  guilty  to  fraud  and  are  expected  to  give  evidence  against  Mr  Scrushy.  |||    ""We  will  present  evidence  that  Richard  Scrushy  knew  about  the  conspiracy,  that  he  participated  in  the  conspiracy  and  that  he  profited,""  prosecutor  Alice  Martin  told  the  court.  Mr  Scrushy  is  the  first  chief  executive  to  be  tried  for  breaching  the  Sarbanes  Oxley  Act  -  a  law  introduced  in  the  wake  of  the  Enron  and  WorldCom  frauds  which  obliges  corporate  bosses  to  vouch  for  the  accuracy  of  their  companies'  results.  Among  the  charges  he  faces  are  conspiracy  to  commit  fraud,  filing  false  statements  and  money  laundering.  After  federal  agents  raided  HealthSouth's  offices  in  March  2003,  the  company  said  none  of  its  past  financial  statements  could  be  relied  on.  The  firm  has  since  reorganised  its  board  and  management  team  and  currently  operates  about  1,400  health  clinics." 

2	"EU  China  arms  ban  'to  be  lifted'  |||    The  EU  embargo  on  arms  exports  to  China  is  likely  to  be  lifted  in  the  next  six  months  despite  US  objections,  UK  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  has  said.  |||    The  15-year-old  ban  was  imposed  in  the  aftermath  of  China's  crackdown  on  protesters  in  Tiananmen  Square.  Mr  Straw  told  a  Commons  select  committee  human  rights  concerns  over  China  remained.  But  he  said  it  was  wrong  to  put  China  under  the  same  embargo  as  countries  such  as  Zimbabwe  and  Burma.  |||    In  December,  the  EU  pledged  to  work  towards  lifting  the  ban  but  said  it  was  not  ready  to  do  so  yet.  The  EU's  move  was  welcomed  at  the  time  by  Beijing,  which  described  the  embargo  as  a  ""product  of  the  Cold  War"".  German  Chancellor  Gerhard  Schroeder  and  French  President  Jacques  Chirac  have  repeatedly  called  for  the  embargo  to  be  lifted.  Britain  has  been  more  cautious  on  the  issue,  but  on  Wednesday  Mr  Straw  said  he  also  wanted  it  to  end.  ""I  have  long  understood  China's  argument,  that  to  lump  them  in  with,  say,  Burma  and  Zimbabwe  is  not  appropriate  and  I  don't  think  it  is,""  he  told  the  joint  committee  on  Strategic  Export  Controls.  He  said  ""it  is  more  likely  than  not""  that  the  ban  would  be  lifted  before  Britain  takes  over  the  presidency  of  the  EU  from  Luxembourg  in  July.  But  he  said  an  EU  code  of  conduct  would  prevent  an  increase  in  the  number  of  arms  being  exported  to  the  country.  ""If  it  is  lifted  we  will  end  up  with  as  effective  arms  controls  in  relation  to  China  as  we  have  now.""  |||    Mr  Straw  said  the  US  government  was  suspicious  of  ""the  motives  of  some  other  countries  within  the  EU""  in  wanting  the  ban  lifted.  But  he  said  many  of  Washington's  objections  were  based  on  a  ""lack  of  information  and  understanding""  of  how  export  control  guidelines  worked  in  EU  countries.  And  ""intense  discussions""  were  taking  place  with  US  officials  to  convince  them  it  was  the  right  thing  to  do.  Washington  is  thought  to  fear  it  would  lead  to  a  buying  spree  for  arms  that  could  be  used  by  China  to  threaten  its  diplomatic  rival  Taiwan.  US  officials  say  they  are  not  satisfied  the  mechanisms  in  the  EU  code  of  conduct  are  robust  enough  to  prevent  abuses.  US  Undersecretary  of  State  John  Bolton  is  meeting  British  officials  this  week  to  press  the  case  for  keeping  the  embargo."

The  KSE  index  closed  at  6709.93  -  an  overall  gain  of  nearly  400  points  in  the  first  two  trading  days  of  the  week.  Energy  and  telecommunication  stocks  performed  particularly  well,  recording  an  8%-10%  rise  since  Monday  morning.  |||    In  2002,  the  KSE  was  the  world's  best  performing  stock  market,  with  the  index  rising  112%.  |||    Pakistani  investors  are  expecting  the  KSE  to  repeat,  if  not  improve  on,  its  2002  performance.  Jubilant  investors  danced  on  the  streets  as  the  market  closed  for  the  day  on  Tuesday,  confident  that  the  boom  will  continue  at  least  until  the  public  holiday  on  22  January.  Others,  however,  who  had  stayed  out  fearing  an  imminent  collapse  because  of  prices  overheating,  continued  to  warn  that  the  ""bubble  may  burst  any  time"".  ""That's  rubbish,""  KSE  chairman  Yaseen  Lakhani  told  the  BBC  News  website.  ""Whenever  the  market  reflects  Pakistan's  true  economic  reality,  it  is  described  as  a  bubble.""  Mr  Lakhani  feels  that  the  market  has  risen  on  the  basis  of  solid  economic  growth  and  its  current  level  rests  on  sound  foundations.  |||    Market  analysts  are  inclined  to  agree  with  Mr  Lakhani,  arguing  that  there  are  a  number  of  major  factors  behind  the  KSE's  performance.  Analysts  argue  that  a  steady  improvement  in  Pakistan's  credit  ratings  by  international  credit  rating  agencies  has  finally  begun  to  register  in  the  market.  Standard  &  Poor's  upgraded  Pakistan  a  few  weeks  ago.  There  are  indications  of  yet  another  upgrade  by  the  end  of  February.  |||    Then,  say  analysts,  there  is  corporate  profitability  in  the  current  fiscal  year,  which  has  gone  up  by  27%  from  last  year.  ""Coupled  with  the  7%  GDP  growth  expected  by  June  this  year,  I  am  least  surprised  at  the  market's  performance,""  says  Mr  Lakhani.  One  leading  Karachi  broker  said  the  real  reasons  may  be  political.  ""If  you  file  a  $1.3  trillion  case  against  Saudi  money  after  9/11,  Arab  money  will  not  go  to  the  US  any  more.""  A  lot  of  Arab  money,  he  says,  has  already  gone  to  Malaysia  and  Indonesia.  Pakistanis  are  now  hoping  that  energy  and  telecoms,  two  of  the  strongest  sectors  in  Pakistan,  draw  some  of  the  Arab  money  to  the  KSE.  |||    Locally,  too,  say  analysts,  recent  political  developments  have  worked  to  the  market's  advantage.  |||    An  anti-Musharraf  campaign  threatened  by  the  MMA,  a  countrywide  alliance  of  religious  parties,  has  fizzled  out.  The  release  of  Asif  Zardari,  former  Prime  Minister  Benazir  Bhutto's  husband,  has  eased  political  tensions  between  the  military-backed  government  and  the  opposition  Pakistan  People's  Party.  Most  importantly,  say  analysts,  the  failure  of  talks  between  India  and  Pakistan  on  the  Baglihar  dam  in  Indian-administered  Kashmir  has  not  automatically  led  to  heightened  tensions.  This,  they  say,  indicates  that  neither  country  is  interested  in  raising  the  temperature  at  this  stage,  irrespective  of  the  state  of  their  disagreements.  The  market  is  abuzz  with  speculation  that  substantial  investment  may  now  start  to  flow  in  from  the  US,  a  country  seen  locally  as  deeply  interested  in  defusing  tensions  between  the  South  Asian  neighbours.  ""You  can  call  it  a  peace  dividend,""  smiles  one  broker.  ""Let  us  see  how  long  one  can  reap  its  benefits.""" 

0	"EU  'too  slow'  on  economic  reforms  |||    Most  EU  countries  have  failed  to  put  in  place  policies  aimed  at  making  Europe  the  world's  most  competitive  economy  by  the  end  of  the  decade,  a  report  says.  |||    The  study,  undertaken  by  the  European  Commission,  sought  to  assess  how  far  the  EU  has  moved  towards  meeting  its  economic  targets.  In  2000,  EU  leaders  at  a  summit  in  Lisbon  pledged  the  European  economy  would  outstrip  that  of  the  US  by  2010.  Their  economic  targets  became  known  as  the  Lisbon  Agenda.  But  the  Commission  report  says  that,  in  most  EU  countries,  the  pace  of  economic  reform  has  been  too  slow,  and  fulfilling  the  Lisbon  ambitions  will  be  difficult  -  if  not  impossible.  |||    Only  the  UK,  Finland,  Belgium,  Denmark,  Ireland  and  the  Netherlands  have  actually  followed  up  policy  recommendations.  Among  the  biggest  laggards,  according  to  the  report,  are  Greece  and  Italy.  The  Lisbon  Agenda  set  out  to  increase  the  number  of  people  employed  in  Europe  by  encouraging  more  older  people  and  women  to  stay  in  the  workforce.  It  also  set  out  to  raise  the  amount  the  private  sector  spends  on  research  and  development,  while  bringing  about  greater  discipline  over  public  spending  and  debt  levels.  Combined  with  high  environmental  standards  and  efforts  to  level  the  playing  field  for  businesses  throughout  the  EU,  the  plan  was  for  Europe  to  become  the  world's  most  dynamic  economy  by  2010.  Next  week,  the  Commission  will  present  revised  proposals  to  meet  the  Lisbon  goals.  Many  people  expect  the  2010  target  to  be  quietly  dropped."

""The  impact  of  the  development  of  no-frills  airlines  is  being  felt  ever  more  strongly,""  said  chief  executive  Jean-Louis  Raymond.  Income  from  its  vehicle-carrying  shuttle  services  fell  7%,  although  15%  more  passengers  meant  a  2%  rise  in  railway  revenue.  |||    The  cross-Channel  truck  market  is  improving,  Eurotunnel  said,  but  warned  that  it  was  not  benefiting  since  much  of  the  traffic  was  in  containers  destined  for  ports.  The  passenger-only  trains  which  use  the  tunnel  are  run  by  a  separate  company,  Eurostar.  |||    Eurotunnel  is  still  struggling  with  debts  of  more  than  6bn  euros.  The  company  is  currently  kept  afloat  by  the  200-plus  banks  to  whom  it  owes  the  money.  A  shareholder  revolt  threw  out  the  old  board  in  2004.  But  the  BBC's  business  editor,  Jeff  Randall,  said  the  banks  could  yet  step  in  and  take  over  altogether.  ""At  the  moment  it  can't  even  service  the  interest  on  its  debt,""  he  said.  ""This  is  a  company  in  the  departure  lounge  of  life.""" 

1	"Elton  plays  Paris  charity  concert  |||    Sir  Elton  John  has  performed  at  a  special  concert  in  Paris  to  raise  money  for  the  victims  of  the  Asian  tsunami.  |||    The  British  singer  played  to  a  2,700-strong  audience  on  Sunday  at  the  French  capital's  Bastille  opera  house.  The  concert  was  also  part  of  an  attempt  to  bring  a  broader  range  of  events  to  the  famous  venue.  Money  raised  will  go  to  the  Fondation  pour  l'Enfance  (Foundation  for  Childhood)  which  aims  to  rebuild  a  children's  shelter  in  Sri  Lanka.  Sir  Elton  played  hits  from  his  vast  back  catalogue  to  a  sell-out  crowd  which  included  former  French  president  Valery  Giscard  d'Estaing  and  his  wife  Anne-Aymone.  The  veteran  pop  star  played  piano  accompaniment  throughout  the  concert  which  lasted  for  three  hours  without  an  interval.  |||    He  told  the  crowd:  ""Throughout  the  years,  I've  done  a  lot  of  drugs  and  alcohol.  It's  true  that  I  was  a  nightmare,  impossible.  For  the  last  14  years  I've  been  normal.  Now  my  drug  is  called  David""  -  a  reference  to  David  Furnish,  his  partner.  The  crowd,  who  greeted  each  song  with  a  standing  ovation,  also  included  French  singer  Charles  Aznavour  and  British  ambassador  Sir  John  Holmes.  Sir  Elton  has  also  teamed  up  with  Phil  Collins  to  record  a  version  of  Eric  Clapton's  1991  hit  Tears  In  Heaven  to  raise  money  for  the  relief  fund.  A  release  date  has  yet  to  be  set  for  the  recording,  which  was  organised  by  Sharon  Osbourne."

The  move,  which  was  justified  on  national  security  grounds,  follows  an  earlier  vote  by  MPs  to  give  themselves  a  veto  over  foreign  investments.  Turkcell  said  the  decision  ""increases  the  risks""  attached  to  the  project.  Although  the  company's  statement  said  it  would  continue  to  monitor  developments,  observers  said  they  thought  Turkcell  was  set  to  pull  out  of  the  $3bn  deal.  ""The  possibility  of  carrying  out  this  project  is  next  to  zero,""  said  Atinc  Ozkan,  analyst  at  Finans  Investment  in  Istanbul.  If  Turkcell  does  back  out,  MTN  -  the  South  African  firm  which  lost  out  in  the  original  tender  -  may  well  be  back  in  the  running.  The  company  has  said  it  is  prepared  to  accept  a  minority  stake  if  Iran  will  award  it  the  mobile  deal.  |||    Turkcell's  mobile  deal  is  the  second  Turkish  investment  in  Iran  to  run  into  trouble.  Turkish-Austrian  consortium  TAV  was  chosen  to  build  and  run  Tehran's  new  Imam  Khomeini  International  Airport  -  but  the  army  closed  it  just  hours  after  it  opened  in  May  2004.  In  both  cases,  the  justification  has  been  national  security,  amid  allegations  that  the  Turkish  firms  are  too  close  to  Israel.  The  hardline  posture  taken  by  parliament,  which  is  dominated  by  religious  conservatives,  could  yet  impact  other  inward  investments."

It  also  acquired  67.7%  of  Hexal's  US  affiliate  Eon  Labs,  and  offered  to  buy  the  remaining  shares  for  $31  each.  Novartis  said  that  it  would  be  able  to  make  cost  savings  of  about  $200m  a  year  following  the  acquisitions.  Novartis'  shares  rose  1%  to  57.85  Swiss  francs  in  early  trading.  |||    The  deal  will  see  Novartis'  Sandoz  business  overtake  Israel's  Teva  Pharmaceuticals  as  the  world's  biggest  maker  of  generics.  Based  on  2004  figures  the  newly  merged  producer  would  have  sales  of  more  than  $5bn,  the  company  estimated.  Novartis  said  that  it  would  merge  a  number  of  departments,  adding  that  there  may  be  job  cuts.  |||    ""The  strong  growth  outlook  for  Sandoz,  which  will  create  jobs,  is  expected  to  partially  compensate  for  necessary  reductions  in  the  work  force,""  the  firm  said  in  a  statement.  Generic  drugs  are  chemically  identical  to  their  more  expensive  branded  rivals.  Producers  such  as  Sandoz  can  copy  the  branded  products  usually  after  their  patent  protection  expires  and  can  sell  them  more  cheaply  as  they  do  not  have  to  pay  research  and  development  cost.  |||    There  are  more  than  150  generic  drugmakers  worldwide  and  analysts  have  predicted  consolidation  in  a  market  that  they  call  fragmented.  However,  not  all  analysts  were  initially  convinced  about  the  deal.  ""This  is  a  very  expensive  acquisition,""  Birgit  Kuhlhoff,  from  Sal  Oppenheim  investment  bank,  told  Reuters.  ""I  find  it  strange  that  they  are  making  acquisitions  in  exactly  those  markets  where  they  suffered  price  pressure.""" 

2	"Green  fear  for  transport  ballot  |||    The  Green  Party  is  concerned  thousands  of  residents  may  not  be  able  to  vote  in  Edinburgh's  transport  referendum.  |||    Edinburgh  City  Council  is  to  ballot  constituents  on  proposals  to  introduce  congestion  charging  in  the  capital.  But  Green  MSP  Mark  Ballard  fears  people  not  on  the  council's  edited  electoral  register  may  miss  out.  Local  authorities  can  only  send  ballot  papers  to  those  on  the  edited  list  over  non-statutory  matters,  such  as  the  transport  referendum.  Therefore,  residents  who  have  exercised  their  right  to  have  their  details  left  off  the  list  could  miss  the  chance  to  vote.  |||    However,  there  is  still  time  for  those  who  are  not  on  the  list  to  contact  the  council  and  make  sure  they  are  sent  ballot  forms  ahead  of  February's  voting  deadline.  Mr  Ballard  said:  ""This  vote  will  set  the  future  of  transport  in  Edinburgh  for  decades  to  come.  ""It  is  therefore  vital  that  as  many  residents  as  possible  in  Edinburgh  City  and  the  surrounding  areas,  are  registered  to  vote  in  the  ballot.  ""Many  people  are  not  aware  that  they  may  miss  out  on  their  chance  to  have  a  say.  ""Everyone  involved  in  this  debate  -  both  for  and  against  -  wants  the  ballot  to  be  as  fair  and  representative  as  possible,  and  that  means  encouraging  people  to  take  part.""  The  ballot  will  ask  residents  to  vote  for  or  against  the  council's  proposed  congestion  charge  scheme  and  a  host  of  transport  improvements  to  be  funded  by  it.  The  outcome  of  the  referendum  will  be  known  next  month  after  the  ballot  forms  are  sent  out  and  returned  to  the  council.  Towards  the  end  of  February,  the  council  will  meet  to  decide  whether  to  proceed  with  an  application  to  Scottish  ministers  for  approval  for  its  planned  congestion  charging  scheme  and  the  other  parts  of  its  transport  package." 

2	"Plan  to  give  elderly  care  control  |||    Elderly  and  disabled  people  would  choose  how  their  own  budget  for  personal  care  was  spent  and  organised  under  government  plans.  |||    Ministers  say  elderly  and  disabled  people  themselves,  not  social  workers,  should  be  able  to  decide  on  their  care  and  stay  in  their  own  homes.  They  also  plan  a  supremo  for  adult  services  in  each  English  area  to  get  different  agencies  working  together.  But  the  government  shunned  opponents'  calls  for  free  long-term  care.  |||    There  are  1.7m  people  needing  care  in  England  and  ministers  suggest  the  number  could  quadruple  by  2050.  Monday's  consultation  paper  on  social  care  for  adults  in  England  is  aimed  at  ending  a  system  which  generates  dependency.  Health  Minister  Stephen  Ladyman  said:  ""This  document  is  the  antithesis  of  the  nanny  state.  |||    ""It's  about  taking  power  away  from  the  state  and  giving  it  to  individuals  and  saying  that  we  will  help  you  make  these  decisions  but  we  are  not  going  to  make  them  for  you  any  more.""  The  government  has  already  allowed  local  councils  to  give  people  money  so  they  can  pay  for  their  services  directly  but  take-up  of  the  scheme  has  been  ""disappointing"".  |||    Ministers  say  the  new  plans  would  make  direct  payments  simpler  and  try  to  counter  reluctance  in  some  local  councils  to  use  the  payments.  They  also  want  to  set  up  a  new  ""half-way  house""  where  social  workers  tell  people  how  much  money  is  available  for  their  care  and  help  them  choose  how  to  spend  that  ""individual  budget"".  The  scheme  will  be  funded  on  existing  budgets  set  until  2008.  But  Mr  Ladyman  said  the  plans  could  deliver  savings  in  some  areas,  such  as  freeing  up  NHS  beds  and  preventing  illnesses.  He  ruled  out  free  personal  care  in  England  -  which  is  on  offer  in  Scotland  and  Wales,  saying  it  was  ""unsustainable"".  |||    David  Rogers,  from  the  Local  Government  Association,  said  agencies  were  working  together  on  the  kind  of  innovation  proposed  by  the  government.  And  Tony  Hunter,  president  of  the  Association  of  Directors  of  Social  Services,  said  the  plans  could  improve  dignity  and  well-being  for  thousands  of  people.  But  Age  Concern  argued  social  care  was  chronically  under-funded  and  older  people  were  being  offered  choice  in  principle,  but  not  in  practice.  Its  director  general,  Gordon  Lishman,  said:  ""Direct  payments  will  not  work  if  there  are  no  services  for  people  to  choose  from  locally.""  |||    The  Tories  say  people  who  pay  for  three  years'  long-term  care  directly  or  through  insurance  should  be  guaranteed  free  care  for  the  rest  of  their  lives.  Tory  spokesman  Simon  Burns  said  more  than  80,000  long  term  care  places  had  been  lost  since  1997.  ""After  eight  years  of  persistent  change,  dogmatic  enforcement  of  regulation,  and  overbearing  government  initiatives  -  we  need  action,  not  a  vision,""  said  Mr  Burns.

Axa  blamed  a  poor  stock  market  performance  for  the  cut,  adding  that  recent  gains  have  not  yet  offset  the  market  falls  seen  in  2001  and  2002.  The  cut  will  hit  an  estimated  3%  of  Axa's  policyholders.  The  rest  will  know  their  fate  in  March.  |||    The  cuts  on  Axa's  policies  will  mean  a  policyholder  who  had  invested  £50  a  month  into  an  endowment  policy  for  the  past  25  years  would  see  a  final  maturity  payout  of  £46,998.  This  equated  to  a  annual  investment  growth  rate  of  8%  Axa  said.  With-profits  policies  are  designed  to  smooth  out  the  peaks  and  troughs  of  stock  market  volatility.  However,  heavy  stock  market  falls  throughout  2001  and  2002  forced  most  firms  to  trim  bonus  rates  on  their  policies.  ""The  stock  market  has  grown  over  the  past  18  months,  however  not  enough  to  undo  the  damage  that  occurred  during  2001  and  2002,""  Axa  spokesman  Mark  Hamilton,  Axa  spokesman,  told  BBC  News.  Axa  cut  payouts  for  the  same  investors  last  January."

Although  the  index  was  lower  than  in  January,  the  fact  that  it  held  above  50  shows  continued  growth  in  the  sector.  ""February  was  another  good  month  in  the  manufacturing  sector,""  said  ISM  survey  chairman  Norbert  Ore.  |||    ""While  the  overall  rate  of  growth  is  slowing,  the  overall  picture  is  improving  as  price  increases  and  shortages  are  becoming  less  of  a  problem.  Exports  and  imports  remain  strong,""  he  said.  Analysts  had  expected  February's  figure  to  be  stronger  than  January's  and  come  in  at  57.  Of  the  20  manufacturing  sectors  surveyed  by  ISM,  13  reported  growth.  They  included  the  textiles,  apparel,  tobacco,  chemicals  and  transportation  sectors.  The  ISM's  index  of  national  manufacturing  activity  is  compiled  from  the  responses  of  purchasing  executives  at  more  than  400  industrial  companies."

In  at  number  three  was  Iron  Maiden  for  the  Number  Of  The  Beast  and  Erasure  entered  the  chart  at  four  with  Breathe.  Elvis's  number  one  is  the  999th  in  chart  history  and  comes  the  day  after  what  would  have  been  his  70th  birthday.  Fans  around  the  world  held  tribute  events  for  the  singer  on  Saturday,  ranging  from  concerts  to  memorabilia  exhibitions.  Meanwhile,  a  poll  carried  out  by  royalty  payments  group  the  Performing  Right  Society  found  that  The  Wonder  of  You  is  the  Elvis  song  most  performed  by  live  bands  and  tribute  acts.  |||    Record  company  SonyBMG  are  releasing  Elvis's  18  number  one  singles  at  the  rate  of  one  a  week  in  Britain,  complete  with  original  artwork  and  a  collector's  box.  Hit  single  One  Night  will  follow  next  week  -  with  the  chance  of  becoming  the  1,000th  number  one  as  interest  surrounding  Elvis's  birthday  grows.  Elsewhere  in  the  singles  charts,  the  Scissor  Sisters  went  straight  in  at  number  five  with  Filthy/Gorgeous.  Band  Aid  20  slipped  to  six  after  seven  weeks  in  the  chart  with  Do  They  Know  It's  Christmas.  The  other  two  new  entries  are  Dana  Rayne  with  Object  of  My  Desire  at  seven  and  Kasabian  who  are  at  number  eight  with  Cut  Off.  Making  up  the  top  10  are  Boulevard  of  Broken  Dreams  by  Green  Day,  down  three  places  to  number  nine,  and  Out  of  Touch  by  Uniting  Nations,  also  down  three  places  to  10.  In  the  album  charts,  the  Scissor  Sisters  went  to  number  one  with  their  self-titled  release,  knocking  Green  Day's  American  Idiot  to  third  place.

Operating  profits  were  at  380m  euros,  ten  times  more  than  in  2003.  Lufthansa  was  hit  in  2003  by  tough  competition  and  a  dip  in  demand  following  the  Iraq  war  and  the  killer  SARS  virus.  It  was  also  hit  by  troubles  at  its  US  catering  business.  Last  year,  Lufthansa  showed  signs  of  recovery  even  as  some  European  and  US  airlines  were  teetering  on  the  brink  of  bankruptcy.  The  board  of  Lufthansa  has  recommended  paying  a  2004  dividend  of  0.30  euros  per  share.  In  2003,  shareholders  did  not  get  a  dividend.

It  was  one  of  the  last  dates  he  did  in  London.""  |||    :  The  album  Exodus  came  out  in  1977  and  that  provided  five  hits  and  confirmed  his  global  superstar  status.  ""By  1979  he  was  the  biggest  touring  attraction  in  the  world.  I  remember  going  to  see  dates  in  Milan  and  Turin  and  they  were  enormous  concerts.""  |||    :  Bob  was  one  of  the  most  mesmeric  people  I've  ever  had  the  privilege  to  work  with.  ""He  must  have  had  an  iron  will  to  succeed.  Bob  was  a  very  driven  individual.  You  realised  from  the  start  there  was  a  manifest  destiny  within  him  that  he  believed  in.  He  didn't  suffer  fools  gladly.  At  the  risk  of  stating  the  obvious,  he  was  an  extraordinary  song  writer  and  his  stage  act  was  perhaps  the  greatest  I've  ever  seen.  I  saw  him  many  times.""  |||    :  ""I  recall  in  1978  he  came  to  the  UK  for  Top  of  the  Pops  and  a  Daily  Mirror  journalist  did  a  half-hour  interview.

I  arranged  for  him  to  play  four  days  of  football  indoors  in  Fulham.  ""Bob  was  a  good  player.  We  are  talking  about  Jamaican-style  football.  He  was  an  attacking  midfield  player.  His  team  assembled  wherever  his  gigs  were.  We  played  in  Brazil  against  some  World  Cup-winning  players.""  |||    :  It  was  always  a  struggle  for  him  to  connect  with  Black  America.  Reggae  did  not  correspond  with  disco  in  the  70s.  But  Bob  in  the  1990s  became  one  of  the  great  icons  in  America  and  the  Third  World.

1	"Bets  off  after  Big  Brother  'leak'  |||    A  bookmaker  has  stopped  taking  bets  on  Celebrity  Big  Brother  after  claiming  ""sensitive  information""  about  the  Channel  4  show  had  been  leaked.  |||    William  Hill  made  the  move  after  four  people  tried  to  place  bets  on  Friday's  surprise  double  eviction.  ""This  is  highly  unlikely  to  have  been  an  inspired  guess,""  William  Hill  spokesman  Rupert  Adams  said.  However,  a  Big  Brother  spokeswoman  was  ""satisfied""  that  sensitive  information  about  the  show  remained  confidential.  |||    The  bookmaker  said  its  suspicions  had  been  aroused  by  betting  for  the  last  two  contestant  evictions,  when  people  were  still  trying  to  place  large  sums  despite  odds  as  short  as  1/14.  But  William  Hill's  ""overwhelming  evidence""  came  on  Friday  when  four  unknown  callers  asked  to  place  bets  on  the  show's  surprise  double  eviction.  |||    Shortly  afterwards  model  Caprice  and  actor  Jeremy  Edwards  left  the  show.  Mr  Adams  believed  someone  had  gained  access  to  figures  which  revealed  how  viewers  were  voting,  and  was  using  them  to  predict  which  celebrity  would  be  evicted  next.  ""We  think  somebody  somewhere  has  got  them  and  has  been  trying  very  hard  to  take  us  to  the  cleaners,""  he  said.  The  bets  were  not  taken.  Mr  Adams  did  not  believe  anyone  from  Channel  4  or  Big  Brother  producer  Endemol  had  tried  to  place  the  queried  bets.  But  he  added:  ""They  need  to  look  at  how  many  people  are  privy  to  the  sensitive  information.""  |||    Big  Brother's  spokeswoman  said:  ""Only  a  handful  of  senior  production  executives  are  privy  to  any  sensitive  information  regarding  eviction  voting  and  there  are  strict  procedures  in  place  to  keep  this  information  strictly  confidential.  ""We  do  not  feel  the  need  to  investigate  this  further  as  we  are  satisfied  that  these  measures  are  effective.""  The  show's  independent  adjudicator  -  the  Electoral  Reform  Services  -  was  also  satisfied,  she  added.  The  current  series  of  Celebrity  Big  Brother  ends  on  Sunday,  with  Happy  Mondays  star  Bez,  actress  Brigitte  Nielsen  and  Blazin'  Squad  rapper  Kenzie  competing  for  a  £50,000  charity  prize.  |||    Bookmaker  Ladbrokes  said  it  would  continue  to  accept  bets  on  the  final,  with  Kenzie  its  favourite  at  2/9.  ""We  felt  no  need  whatsoever  to  close  the  book,""  spokesman  Warren  Lush  said.  ""We've  seen  absolutely  no  suspicious  betting  patterns.""  Mr  Lush  added  that  people  sometimes  vote  on  short  odds  ""because  they  think  it's  like  buying  money"".  ""You  do  have  to  risk  quite  a  lot  of  money  for  a  very  small  gain  but  if  they  think  there's  no  chance  of  an  upset  they  will  still  do  it,""  he  said."

Predicted  chart-topper  Do  They  Know  it's  Christmas?  is  expected  to  sell  at  least  300,000  copies  by  the  time  the  new  chart  is  announced  on  Sunday.  However,  the  new  version  of  the  1984  single  is  not  going  to  be  released  in  the  US,  despite  being  sold  in  many  countries  around  the  world.  US  record  shops  are  stocking  an  import  version  of  Do  They  Know  It's  Christmas,  which  is  said  to  be  selling  very  well  in  Los  Angeles  and  New  York.  The  original  track  was  released  in  the  US,  and  reached  number  13  in  the  singles  chart.  British  stars  who  appear  on  the  current  recording,  such  as  Dido  and  Coldplay's  Chris  Martin,  are  well-known  to  music  fans  across  the  Atlantic,  along  with  U2  frontman  Bono.  |||    Record  company  Universal  is  responsible  for  the  global  distribution  of  the  single,  which  will  be  available  across  Europe,  Asia,  South  America  and  Canada.  But  music  fans  in  the  US  are  still  able  to  access  the  song  and  download  it  on  Band  Aid  20's  official  website.  In  1985,  a  group  of  high-profile  American  stars  known  as  USA  For  Africa  came  together  to  record  their  own  fund-raising  single,  We  Are  The  World.  The  song  was  written  by  Lionel  Richie  and  Michael  Jackson,  with  Quincy  Jones  as  producer.  It  topped  the  US  charts  for  three  weeks  and  went  on  win  Grammy  awards  for  best  record  and  song.  |||    Dionne  Warwick,  Diana  Ross  and  Tina  Turner  were  among  the  line-up  of  performers.  It  is  predicted  that  the  Band  Aid  20  song  will  sell  300,000  copies  in  the  UK  by  the  time  the  new  chart  is  announced  on  Sunday.  The  record  is  also  tipped  to  become  this  year's  Christmas  number  one,  as  the  original  version  did  in  1984.  Proceeds  from  the  sales  are  going  towards  relief  for  the  Darfur  region  of  Sudan  and  to  combat  HIV  and  Aids  across  Africa." 

2	"Tory  'stalking  horse'  Meyer  dies  |||    Sir  Anthony  Meyer,  the  Tory  backbencher  who  challenged  Margaret  Thatcher  for  the  party  leadership  in  1989,  has  died.  |||    He  was  84,  had  been  suffering  from  cancer  for  many  months,  and  died  at  his  London  home.  That  failed  ""stalking  horse""  leadership  challenge  made  it  easier  for  Michael  Heseltine  to  mount  his  own  bid.  That  in  turn  paved  the  way  for  John  Major  to  move  into  10  Downing  Street,  after  the  second  ballot.  Meyer's  constituency  party,  Clwyd  North  West,  which  he  had  represented  as  an  MP  for  more  than  20  years,  deselected  him  as  a  result  of  that  challenge.  Sir  Anthony  John  Charles  Meyer  was  born  on  27  October,  1920.  Educated  at  Eton,  and  at  New  College,  Oxford,  he  served  in  the  Scots  Guards  from  1941  to  1945  and  was  wounded  in  tanks  in  Normandy.  He  worked  under  Edward  Heath  on  Europe  at  the  Foreign  Office  and  subsequently  won  the  Eton  and  Slough  seat  for  the  Tories  in  1964  -  by  11  votes.  Labour  regained  the  seat  two  years  later,  and  Meyer  had  to  wait  until  1970  before  he  could  re-enter  Parliament.  His  prospects  of  a  front  bench  slot  remained  remote  because  he  tended  to  defy  the  party  line."

It  is  the  second  time  Vodafone  has  come  under  the  Commission's  scrutiny.  The  UK  operator  is  already  appealing  against  allegations  that  its  UK  roaming  rates  are  ""unfair  and  excessive"".  Vodafone's  response  to  the  Commission's  letter  was  defiant.  ""We  believe  the  roaming  market  is  competitive  and  we  expect  to  resist  the  charges,""  said  a  Vodafone  spokesman.  ""However  we  will  need  time  to  examine  the  statement  of  objections  in  detail  before  we  formally  respond.""  |||    The  Commission's  investigation  into  Vodafone  and  Deutsche  Telekom's  T-Mobile  centres  on  the  tariffs  the  two  companies  charge  foreign  mobile  operators  to  access  their  networks  when  subscribers  of  those  foreign  operators  use  their  mobile  phones  in  Germany.  |||    The  Commission  believes  these  wholesale  prices  are  too  high  and  that  the  excess  is  passed  on  to  consumers.  ""The  Commission  aims  to  ensure  that  European  consumers  are  not  overcharged  when  they  use  their  mobile  phones  on  their  travels  around  the  European  Union,""  the  Commission  said  in  a  statement.  Vodafone  and  O2,  Britain's  other  big  mobile  phone  operator,  were  sent  similar  statements  of  objections  by  the  Commission  in  July  last  year.  Vodafone  sent  the  Commission  a  response  to  those  allegations  in  December  last  year  and  is  now  waiting  for  a  reply.  The  Vodafone  spokesman  said  a  similar  process  would  be  set  in  motion  with  these  latest  statement  of  objections  about  its  operations  in  Germany.  |||    The  companies  will  have  three  months  to  respond  to  the  Commission's  allegations  and  the  process  ""may  go  on  for  some  time  yet"",  the  spokesman  said.  The  Commission  could  charge  the  companies  up  to  10%  of  their  annual  turnover,  though  in  practice  that  sort  of  figure  is  rarely  demanded.  The  Commission's  latest  move  comes  just  a  few  months  after  national  telecoms  regulators  across  Europe  launched  a  joint  investigation  which  could  lead  to  people  being  charged  less  for  using  their  mobile  phone  when  travelling  abroad.  The  investigation  involves  regulators  assessing  whether  there  is  effective  competition  in  the  roaming  market."

The  Simpsons  and  Dallas  and  24  were  among  the  magazine's  list  of  the  best  all-time  imports  from  the  US.  Soap  operas  Knots  Landing,  Falcon  Crest  plus  The  Bold  And  The  Beautiful  all  made  the  top  10  of  Transatlantic  TV  howlers.  The  Jerry  Springer  Show,  which  came  in  at  sixth  on  the  list,  did  not  fare  well.  |||    Broadcast  magazine  said:  ""British  TV  never  realised  how  low  it  could  go  before  Jerry  showed  the  way.""  Baywatch  rose  to  the  top  of  the  list  for  having  ""mind-numbingly  predictable  scripts:  beachgoer  is  saved  from  drowning,""  according  to  the  magazine.  Just  inside  the  all-time  worst  top  10  came  Extreme  Makeover,  which  sees  members  of  the  public  given  thousands  of  pounds  worth  of  plastic  surgery.  Other  American  shows  which  won  praise  were  The  X-Files,  I  Love  Lucy,  Twin  Peaks  and  Star  Trek."

But  a  spokesman  refused  to  comment  on  speculation  that  Mitsubishi  could  end  up  building  cars  for  PSA  and  perhaps  its  Japanese  rival  Nissan.  Mitsubishi  has  been  hit  by  a  recall  scandal  and  the  withdrawal  of  support  from  shareholder  DaimlerChrysler.  The  US-German  firm,  once  a  majority  shareholder,  decided  last  April  to  stop  providing  financial  backing.  Mitsubishi's  sales  have  slid  41%  in  the  past  year,  catalysed  by  the  revelation  that  the  company  had  systematically  been  hiding  records  of  faults  and  then  secretly  repairing  vehicles.  Mitsubishi  is  due  to  unveil  a  recovery  plan  later  in  January.  Analysts  said  that  alliances  with  other  carmakers  would  be  a  necessary  part  of  whatever  it  came  up  with,  not  least  because  its  own  slow  sales  have  left  its  manufacturing  capacity  under-used."

Rinaldi  told  BBC  Sport  from  Rio  de  Janeiro:  ""I  can  assure  you  that  Chelsea  have  had  no  dealings  whatsoever  with  either  me  or  Adriano.  ""Parma  and  Real  Madrid  are  interested  but  there's  nothing  new  there.  Their  interest  has  been  known  for  some  time.""  Adriano  has  scored  14  goals  in  20  Serie  A  appearances  this  season.  And  Chelsea  boss  Jose  Mourinho  had  claimed  that  he  was  in  Milan  talking  to  Adriano  on  the  day  he  is  alleged  to  have  held  a  clandestine  meeting  with  Arsenal  defender  Ashley  Cole.  Mourinho  said  he  was  ""just  practising  my  Portuguese  with  him  because  I  don't  need  strikers"".  Rinaldi  told  BBC  Sport:  ""I  have  to  say  that  nobody  from  Chelsea  or  any  other  London  club  has  contacted  me.  ""If  they  want  to,  that's  fine.  I  can  tell  them  what  the  situation  is.  ""If  Chelsea  are  interested  then  they  must  make  an  offer.""  Inter  are  reported  to  have  slapped  a  price  tag  in  the  region  of  £40m  on  the  head  of  Adriano,  who  joined  them  just  over  a  year  ago  from  Parma.  Real  Madrid  view  him  as  a  natural  replacement  for  compatriot  Ronaldo.  But  Rinaldi  said:  ""I  cannot  give  you  a  price  that  Inter  would  accept  for  Adriano.  That's  something  that  would  have  to  be  negotiated  between  the  interested  clubs."""

""They  seemed  like  a  perfect  fit  with  our  audience,""  said  Rick  Krim,  VH1's  vice  president  of  music  and  talent.  The  band  recently  released  a  new  album,  Astronaut,  the  first  from  the  original  line-up  since  1983.  They  will  also  tour  Japan  and  the  US  next  year.  |||    ""When  we  started  playing  together,  we  didn't  try  and  make  a  really  sort  of  mature  album.  We  just  really  wanted  to  make  a  great  Duran  Duran  album,""  said  keyboard  player  Nick  Rhodes.  ""It's  pretty  much  in  line  with  a  lot  of  stuff  out  there.""  Duran  Duran  are  currently  promoting  the  album's  second  single,  What  Happens  Tomorrow.  |||    Simon  Le  Bon  said  earlier  this  year  that  the  group  were  not  trying  to  update  their  sound  too  much.  ""We  wouldn't  want  to  lose  them  [older  fans]  by  trying  too  hard  by  trying  to  connect  with  a  new  audience,""  the  singer  said.  Le  Bon  also  said  the  five  members  were  getting  on  very  well.  ""We're  like  any  people  who  get  very  close.  Sometimes  you  argue  with  each  other.  But  the  fact  is  we  inspire  each  other  musically.  ""Nobody  else  does  it  for  me,""  he  said.  ""It's  just  very  special.""" 

2	"'Errors'  doomed  first  Dome  sale  |||    The  initial  attempt  to  sell  the  Millennium  Dome  failed  due  to  a  catalogue  of  errors,  a  report  by  the  government's  finance  watchdog  says.  |||    The  report  said  too  many  parties  were  involved  in  decision-making  when  the  attraction  first  went  on  sale  after  the  Millennium  exhibition  ended.  The  National  Audit  Office  said  the  Dome  cost  taxpayers  £28.7m  to  maintain  and  sell  in  the  four  years  after  it  closed.  Finally,  a  deal  to  turn  it  into  a  sport  and  entertainment  venue  was  struck.  More  than  £550m  could  now  be  returned  to  the  public  sector  in  the  wake  of  the  deal  to  regenerate  the  site  in  Greenwich,  London.  |||    The  NAO  report  said  that  this  sale  went  through  because  it  avoided  many  of  the  problems  of  the  previous  attempt  to  sell  the  Dome.  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  said  a  good  deal  had  been  secured.  ""Delivery  of  the  many  benefits  secured  through  this  deal  will  continue  the  substantial  progress  already  made  at  the  Millennium  Village  and  elsewhere  on  the  peninsula,""  he  said.  But  Edward  Leigh,  who  is  chairman  of  the  Commons  public  accounts  committee,  warned  the  government  would  have  to  work  hard  to  ensure  taxpayers  would  get  full  benefit  from  the  Dome  deal.  He  said:  ""This  report  also  shows  that  the  first  attempt  to  sell  the  Dome  proved  a  complete  fiasco.  Every  arm  of  government  seems  to  have  had  a  finger  in  the  pie.  The  process  was  confused  and  muddled.""  He  added:  ""Four  years  after  the  Millennium  Exhibition  closed,  the  Government  finally  has  a  deal  to  find  a  use  for  what  has  been  a  white  elephant  since  it  closed  in  a  deal  that,  incredible  as  it  may  seem,  should  bring  in  some  money  and  provide  a  benefit  for  the  local  area  and  the  country  as  whole.  However,  it  was  more  a  question  of  luck  that  a  strong  bid  turned  up  after  thefirst  abortive  attempt.""  NAO  head  Sir  John  Bourn  said:  ""In  difficult  circumstances  following  the  failure  of  the  first  competition,  English  Partnerships  and  the  office  of  the  deputy  prime  minister  have  worked  hard  to  get  a  deal.""" 

1	"TV  station  refuses  adoption  show  |||    A  TV  station  in  the  US  has  refused  to  show  a  controversial  new  series  where  adopted  children  try  and  pick  their  birth  father  -  and  win  a  cash  prize.  |||    The  WRAZ-TV  Fox  affiliate  in  North  Carolina  was  the  only  one  of  182  stations  to  refuse  Monday's  show.  Who's  Your  Daddy  promises  $100,000  (£52,000)  to  the  contestant  if  she  correctly  identifies  her  father.  It  was  met  with  protests  by  the  National  Council  for  Adoption,  which  said  it  ""exploits""  sensitive  emotions.  ""It  exploits  the  sensitive  emotions  of  adoption,""  said  Thomas  Atwood,  president  of  the  National  Council  for  Adoption.  ""It  trivialises  them.  Adoption  is  a  very  personal,  meaningful  experience  and  it  should  not  be  commercialised  like  this.""  On  the  pre-taped  programme,  the  contestant  is  presented  with  eight  men  who  may  or  may  not  be  her  natural  father.  |||    If  she  picks  the  correct  man  from  the  line-up,  the  contestant  wins  the  jackpot  prize  of  US$100,000  (£52,590).  However,  if  she  picks  the  wrong  man,  then  the  impostor  takes  the  money.  Fox  producers  defended  the  show,  saying  it  was  a  ""positive  experience"".  They  have  made  six  specials,  though  only  one  episode  has  so  far  been  broadcast.  |||    ""The  special  was  thoroughly  vetted  by  our  standards  and  practices  department  to  ensure  that  it  was  appropriate  for  broadcast,""  said  a  Fox  spokesman.  ""However,  any  network  affiliate  that  feels  the  programming  may  be  inappropriate  for  their  individual  market  has  the  right  to  pre-empt  the  schedule.""  WRAZ-TV  instead  chose  to  air  an  independently-produced  film,  I  Have  Roots  and  Branches...  Personal  Reflections  on  Adoption,  a  documentary  about  families  with  adopted  children.  ""We  just  don't  think  adoption  is  a  game  show,""  said  Tommy  Schenck,  WRAZ-TV's  general  manager,  though  he  said  his  decision  had  not  been  influenced  by  public  protests." 

2	"Prime  minister's  questions  |||    So  who,  if  anyone,  is  playing  politics  with  the  security  of  the  nation?  |||    Michael  Howard  has  no  doubt  it  is  the  prime  minister  who,  he  claims,  is  ""ramming""  through  Parliament  the  controversial  new  anti-terror  measures  without  proper  debate.  He  didn't  say  so,  but  the  Tories  believe  the  prime  minister  is  playing  the  fear  card  on  this  one  so  he  can  look  tough  in  the  run  up  to  the  general  election  And  they  believe  Tony  Blair  is  using  the  issue  to  suggest  the  Tories  are  soft  on  terrorism.  Why  on  earth  will  the  prime  minister  not  simply  take  up  the  Tories'  offer  to  extend  the  existing  powers  temporarily  to  allow  proper  parliamentary  debate  of  the  laws,  he  demanded.  The  prime  minister  claims  this  is  the  clearest  indication  that  it  is  the  Tories  who  are  playing  politics  with  the  issue  by  attempting  to  score  cheap  political  points  in  parliament.  Is  not  the  opposition  against  to  the  proposed  laws  ""in  principle"",  in  which  case  delaying  a  decision  for  further  debate  would  be  pointless?  |||    What  this  is  really  about,  believes  Mr  Blair,  is  the  Tories  spotting  an  opportunity  to  embarrass,  maybe  even  defeat  the  government.  And  that  is  more  important  to  them  than  national  security.  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  avoided  suggesting  anyone  was  playing  politics  with  the  issue.  He  preferred  to  state  that,  as  with  other  issues  like  ID  cards,  the  government's  immediate  instinct  was  authoritarian.  |||    As  is  his  habit  nowadays,  the  prime  minister  was  less  rough  with  Mr  Kennedy  than  he  had  been  with  Mr  Howard  -  he  prefers  a  more  exasperated  tone  suggesting  he  believes  the  Lib  Dems  have,  once  again,  just  missed  the  point.  Apart  from  all  that,  it  was  electioneering  as  usual.  The  very  first  question  to  the  prime  minister  from  Derby  North's  Bob  Laxton  asked  him,  in  effect,  if  he  would  carry  on  the  excellent  policy  of  pouring  more  resources  into  schools.  Later  Birmingham's  Sion  Simon  even  went  so  far  as  to  suggest  the  Tories  were  such  a  shower  that  we  should  have  the  general  election  now.  The  prime  minister  almost  blushed.  This  was  not  the  appropriate  place  to  announce  election  day,  he  stammered.  But  can  anyone  be  in  any  doubt  that  that  announcement  is  just  days  away  -  an  announcement  coming  in  the  week  beginning  4  April  for  an  election  on  5  May  is  where  the  big  money  is  in  the  Commons.  And  perhaps  that  simple  fact  alone  means  everyone  is  seen  to  be  playing  politics  with  just  about  everything  at  the  moment."

The  actor  began  his  film  career  in  the  1940s,  playing  Macduff  to  Orson  Welles'  Macbeth  in  1948,  and  was  also  a  regular  in  on  the  Dublin  stage.

1	"Super  Size  Me  wins  writers'  award  |||    Super  Size  Me  director  Morgan  Spurlock  has  won  the  Writers  Guild  of  America's  award  for  documentary  feature  writing.  |||    The  Oscar-nominated  film  followed  Spurlock  as  he  ate  only  McDonald's  fast  food  for  an  entire  month.  Spurlock  was  given  the  award  at  a  special  ceremony  at  the  Roosevelt  Hotel  in  Hollywood  on  Tuesday.  Organisers  said  the  rising  popularity  of  documentary  films  led  them  to  honour  a  writer  for  a  documentary  screenplay  for  the  first  time.  |||    Producer  Brian  Grazer  presented  the  award  to  Spurlock  and  the  film's  backers,  Roadside  Attractions,  Samuel  Goldwyn  Films  and  Showtime  Independent  Films.  Spurlock  set  out  to  discover  the  effect  of  living  on  nothing  but  McDonald's  for  a  month,  upgrading  to  supersize  portions  when  offered.  The  film  followed  his  25lb  weight  gain  and  the  health  effects  on  his  body,  including  his  liver  and  cholesterol  levels.  McDonald's  announced  it  was  to  scrap  its  ""supersized""  meals  last  year,  but  denied  the  move  was  as  a  result  of  the  negative  publicity  created  by  Spurlock's  film.  Spurlock  was  given  his  award  on  the  same  day  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  ruled  that  two  UK  activists  should  have  been  given  legal  aid  in  their  long  fight  against  a  McDonald's  libel  action.  Helen  Steel  and  David  Morris,  from  north  London,  dubbed  the  ""McLibel  Two"",  were  found  guilty  in  a  1990s  trial  of  libelling  the  company  in  a  leaflet  they  had  been  handing  out  At  the  end  of  the  case  the  High  Court  in  London  ruled  McDonald's  had  been  libelled  and  awarded  the  company  £60,000  in  damages,  later  reduced  to  £40,000  on  appeal.  But  he  found  the  leaflet  was  true  in  some  aspects." 

2	"More  reforms  ahead  says  Milburn  |||    Labour  will  continue  to  pursue  controversial  reforms  if  it  wins  a  third  term  in  power,  the  party's  election  chief  Alan  Milburn  has  said.  |||    He  pledged  Labour  would  encourage  more  people  to  achieve  their  aspirations.  ""What  we  want  is  for  more  people  to  earn  and  own,""  Mr  Milburn  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  show.  Tory  Shadow  Chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  called  Labour  ""a  brilliant  machine  for  talking  about  things""  but  said  it  did  not  deliver  policies  the  country  needs.  Meanwhile,  the  Liberal  Democrats'  President  Simon  Hughes  said:  ""New  Labour  has  lost  people's  confidence  in  a  way  Old  Labour  never  did.""  Mr  Milburn  told  Today  that  Labour  wanted  policies  which  encouraged  increased  social  mobility  in  Britain.  |||    Pressed  on  incapacity  benefits,  he  said  the  tax  and  welfare  system  must  ""provide  the  right  incentives  to  people"".  ""No-one  is  talking  about  driving  people  into  work  but  what  we  do  know  is  there  are  one  million  people  on  incapacity  benefit  who  want  the  opportunity  to  work,  providing  the  right  level  of  support  is  there  for  them"".  However,  backbench  Labour  MP  Karen  Buck  warned  against  proposed  changes  in  such  benefits.  She  told  the  Today  programme:  ""If  the  policy  is  seen  as  being  about  how  do  you  make  the  feckless  poor  go  back  to  work  then  it  is  not  going  to  work,  on  the  one  hand.  And  it  is  not  going  to  improve  our  electoral  chances  on  the  other.""  Mr  Milburn  also  sought  to  draw  a  line  under  the  controversy  about  reports  of  a  feud  between  Gordon  Brown  and  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair.  |||    He  stressed  that  Mr  Brown  would  play  the  same  role  that  he  did  in  the  last  election.  Mr  Milburn  gave  more  details  of  planned  reforms  in  a  speech  to  Labour's  Fabian  Society,  in  which  he  also  praised  Mr  Brown  as  one  of  the  leaders  of  the  party's  reform  process.  In  the  speech,  he  backed  choice  in  schools  and  hospitals,  wider  home  ownership  and  changes  to  the  welfare  system.  Mr  Milburn  insisted  that  government  reform  must  continue.  ""Our  task  is  to  rebuild  the  New  Labour  coalition  around  'one  nation  politics'  that  recognise,  while  life  is  hard  for  many,  all  should  have  the  chance  to  succeed,""  he  said.  ""There  is  a  glass  ceiling  on  opportunity  in  this  country.  In  our  first  two  terms  we  have  raised  it.  In  our  third  term  we  have  to  break  it.""  Voters  turned  on  the  party  when  it  failed  to  reform  industrial  relations  in  the  1960s,  he  also  told  his  audience.  |||    Oliver  Letwin  said  the  government  had  failed  to  deliver  in  any  of  the  key  public  services,  such  as  cleaner  hospitals,  discipline  in  schools  and  putting  more  police  on  the  streets.  He  said  ministers  had  not  delivered  cleaner  hospitals,  with  5,000  people  dying  from  infections  last  year.  New  Labour  had  failed  on  school  discipline  because  it  had  not  implemented  serious  reforms  so  that  teachers  could  run  schools,  and  which  would  give  parents  choice,  he  went  on.  For  the  Lib  Dems,  Simon  Hughes  said  many  pensioners  are  means  tested  for  the  money  they  needed  and  students  who  were  told  there  wouldn't  be  tuition  fees  and  more  debt  ""have  been  given  exactly  the  opposite"".  He  added:  ""Under  New  Labour,  all  households  are  still  paying  unfair  council  tax  rather  than  a  fairer  alternative."""

But  36  people  accused  in  connection  with  the  blasts  said  it  should  not  be  screened  until  the  trial  is  over.  Mumbai  High  Court  postponed  the  film's  launch  until  3  February.  |||    Black  Friday  is  based  upon  the  novel  of  the  same  name  written  by  journalist  S  Hussain  Zaidi,  which  looks  at  the  15  explosions  which  rocked  Mumbai  on  12  March  1993.  Director  Anurag  Kashyap  said  the  film's  release  should  not  be  delayed  as  the  book  has  already  been  on  sale  for  two  years.  ""If  you  have  not  gone  against  the  book,  then  how  can  you  go  against  the  movie?""  Mr  Kashyap's  lawyer  Mihir  Desai  said.  This  is  the  second  time  that  those  accused  in  connection  with  the  blasts  have  sought  legal  intervention  regarding  the  film.  |||    They  previously  asked  that  a  line  from  the  movie's  poster,  which  claimed  the  film  portrayed  ""the  true  story  of  the  Bombay  bomb  blasts"",  be  removed.  Their  lawyer,  Majeed  Memon,  said:  ""We  had  argued  that  how  can  a  film  say  it  is  telling  the  true  story  when  the  court  itself  is  struggling  to  find  the  truth?  ""So  we  said  they  should  remove  the  line  from  their  promotional  posters  and  they  did  give  us  an  assurance  that  they  would  do  so.""  The  Mumbai  bombings  case  is  one  of  India's  longest-running  trials.  A  special  court  was  set  up  to  hear  the  case  and  regular  hearings  have  taken  place  there  for  the  last  nine  years,  with  more  than  six  hundred  witnesses  questioned."

Sales  in  what  is  traditionally  a  strong  month  rose  by  0.5%  on  a  like-for-like  basis,  compared  with  a  year  earlier.  Consumers  remain  cautious  over  buying  big-ticket  items  like  furniture,  said  BRC  director  general  Kevin  Hawkins.

But  clothing  and  footwear  sales  were  said  to  be  generally  better  than  December,  while  department  stores  also  had  a  good  month.  |||    In  the  three-months  to  January,  like-for-like  sales  showed  a  growth  rate  of  -0.1%,  the  same  as  in  the  three  months  to  December,  the  BRC  said.  ""Following  a  relatively  strong  New  Year's  bank  holiday,  trading  then  took  a  downward  turn,""  said  Mr  Hawkins.  ""Even  extending  some  promotions  and  discounts  and  the  pay-day  boost  later  in  the  month  could  not  tempt  customers.""  The  previous  BRC  survey  found  Christmas  2004  was  the  worst  for  10  years  for  retailers.  And  according  to  Office  for  National  Statistics  data,  sales  in  December  failed  to  meet  expectations  and  by  some  counts  were  the  worst  since  1981."

The  deal  would  create  the  world's  biggest  bank  with  assets  of  about  189  trillion  yen  ($1.8  trillion).  Sumitomo's  exit  ends  the  most  high  profile  fight  in  Japanese  bank  history.  |||    UFJ  Holdings,  Japan's  fourth-largest  bank,  has  been  at  the  centre  of  a  fierce  bid  battle  over  the  last  year.  Sumitomo,  Japan's  third-largest  bank,  tabled  a  higher  offer  for  UFJ  than  its  rival,  valuing  the  company  at  $35bn.  |||    However,  UFJ's  management  was  known  to  prefer  the  offer  from  Mitsubishi  Tokyo  Financial  Group  (MTFG),  Japan's  second-largest  bank.  Concerns  were  also  raised  about  Sumitomo's  ability  to  absorb  UFJ  and  the  former  has  now  admitted  defeat.  ""We  believe  the  market  and  most  investors  accept  a  UFJ-MTFG  merger,""  Sumitomo  said  in  a  statement.  ""Given  the  ongoing  integration  of  UFJ  and  MTFG  operations,  persisting  with  our  proposal  may  not  be  in  the  best  interests  of  our  shareholders  or  UFJ's.""  |||    Mitsubishi's  takeover  of  UFJ  -  which  will  be  Japan's  largest-ever  takeover  deal  -  will  still  have  to  be  approved  by  shareholders  of  the  two  firms.  However,  this  is  expected  to  be  a  formality.  Sumitomo  may  now  turn  its  attention  to  deepening  its  ties  with  Daiwa  Securities,  another  Japanese  financial  firm.  The  two  are  set  to  merge  their  venture  capital  operations  and  there  has  been  speculation  that  this  could  lead  to  a  full-blown  merger.  Japanese  banks  are  increasingly  seeking  alliances  to  boost  profits." 

1	"Rocker  Doherty  in  on-stage  fight  |||    Rock  singer  Pete  Doherty  has  been  involved  in  a  fight  with  his  band's  guitarist  at  their  biggest  gig  to  date.  |||    Babyshambles  played  for  5,000  fans  at  London's  Brixton  Academy  on  Tuesday.  The  former  Libertines  singer  traded  blows  with  guitarist  Patrick  Walden.  They  were  separated  and  bundled  off  stage  before  returning  to  end  the  set.  The  show  was  earlier  held  up  due  to  audience  overcrowding.  On  Monday  Doherty  faced  blackmail  and  robbery  charges  in  court,  which  he  denies.  He  is  out  on  £50,000  bail  and  the  judge  agreed  to  extend  his  2200  GMT  curfew  deadline  by  two  hours  so  he  could  play  the  Brixton  gig.  |||    Babyshambles,  which  he  formed  after  his  acrimonious  departure  from  the  Libertines,  played  a  warm-up  show  at  The  Garage,  north  London,  on  Monday.  On  Tuesday,  Doherty  and  his  three  bandmates  were  introduced  to  the  crowd  by  Mick  Jones,  the  former  Clash  guitarist  who  produced  the  Libertines'  second  album.  Babyshambles  took  the  stage  to  a  frenzied  reception  at  2200  GMT,  launching  into  their  last  single,  Killamangiro,  which  reached  number  eight  in  December.  But  the  group  had  to  stop  during  the  next  song  to  persuade  fans  not  to  push  forward  and  allow  security  guards  to  pull  people  out  of  the  crush.  Doherty  appealed  to  fans  to  calm  down,  saying:  ""There's  a  few  people  getting  hurt  down  the  front,  you've  got  to  move  back.""  |||    The  music  resumed  minutes  later  but  after  several  more  songs,  the  singer  appeared  to  accidentally  disconnect  Walden's  guitar,  leading  the  pair  to  trade  kicks  and  punches.  Bouncers  stepped  in  and  the  band  left  the  stage,  but  returned  after  five  minutes  and  finished  their  50-minute  performance  with  no  further  trouble.  Doherty,  25,  had  to  be  home  by  midnight  to  observe  the  curfew,  which  is  one  of  the  conditions  of  his  bail.  On  Monday,  the  judge  agreed  to  allow  him  to  perform  on  condition  that  requests  for  changes  to  his  bail  terms  were  ""not  too  regular  an  occurrence"".  The  singer  was  arrested  with  fellow  musician  Alan  Wass  on  2  February  after  an  alleged  dispute  with  documentary-maker  Max  Carlish  at  a  London  hotel.  They  are  next  due  in  court  on  18  April." 

0	"Oil  prices  reach  three-month  low  |||    Oil  prices  have  fallen  heavily  for  a  second  day,  closing  at  three-month  lows  after  news  that  US  crude  stocks  have  improved  ahead  of  winter.  |||    London  Brent  crude  closed  at  $40.15  on  Thursday  -  a  drop  of  5.1%  -  having  dived  below  $40  a  barrel  for  the  first  time  since  mid-September.  US  light  crude  traded  in  New  York  lost  more  than  $2  to  $43.25,  its  lowest  close  since  10  September.  The  price  of  both  benchmark  crudes  has  dropped  12%  in  two  days.  The  falls  were  triggered  when  the  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA)  said  on  Wednesday  that  US  crude  stocks  were  3.5%  higher  than  a  year  ago.  The  news  calmed  worries  about  winter  shortages.  Weak  US  fuel  and  heating  oil  stocks  have  been  a  persistent  factor  in  pushing  up  oil  prices.  ""It's  amazing  how  quickly  sentiment  changed,""  said  Rick  Mueller,  an  analyst  at  Energy  Security  Analysis.  Analysts  also  attributed  the  fall  to  mild  early-winter  weather,  which  has  tempered  demand  for  heating  oil.  |||    The  stronger  fuel  inventories  helped  boost  US  stock  markets  to  nine-month  highs  on  Wednesday,  though  only  the  Nasdaq  index  had  hung  onto  those  gains  by  the  end  of  Thursday.  |||    In  London,  the  FTSE  100  index  closed  15  points  higher  at  4,751.  The  long-awaited  drop  in  oil  prices  helped  to  ease  persistent  investor  jitters  over  the  impact  of  energy  costs  on  company  profits  and  economic  growth.  However,  traders  warned  that  the  fall  could  be  short-lived  if  there  is  a  cold  snap  in  North  America  this  winter  or  any  major  supply  problems  in  other  parts  of  the  world.  |||    The  price  of  crude  is  still  up  about  30%  on  the  start  of  2004,  but  has  fallen  from  the  record  of  $55.67  set  in  late  October.  Opec  nations  have  increased  production  to  25-year  highs  to  meet  global  demand  and  this  has  helped  rebuild  US  stocks  hit  by  supply  disruptions  after  Hurricane  Ivan  in  September.  Traders  were  also  encouraged  by  comments  on  Wednesday  from  the  energy  minister  of  Opec  member  Algeria.  Chakib  Khelil  said  the  cartel  was  likely  to  keep  output  unchanged  when  it  meets  next  week.  However,  some  analysts  believe  the  sharp  fall  in  crude  prices  may  harden  Opec's  attitude  to  over-production,  leading  to  a  scaling  back  of  oil  output.  |||    Fears  still  remain  over  the  level  of  US  heating  oil  stocks,  which  are  rising  but  remain  down  on  2004  levels.  A  cold  spell  in  north  America  would  start  to  deplete  supplies  and  could  spark  further  price  rises.  Analysts,  however,  say  prices  will  fall  further  if  inventories  continue  to  rise.  ""Mother  Nature  is  going  to  be  huge  in  the  next  several  weeks,""  said  Kyle  Cooper,  at  Citigroup  Global  Markets.  ""Long  term  I  think  we're  headed  to  $30-35  but  I  don't  think  we're  doing  that  yet.  We  have  a  lot  of  winter  left.""  John  Person,  president  of  National  Futures  Advisory  Services,  said  the  EIA  data  indicated  there  should  be  adequate  supplies  for  the  next  three  months  in  the  US.  ." 

2	"Citizenship  event  for  18s  touted  |||    Citizenship  ceremonies  could  be  introduced  for  people  celebrating  their  18th  birthday,  Charles  Clarke  has  said.  |||    The  idea  will  be  tried  as  part  of  an  overhaul  of  the  way  government  approaches  ""inclusive  citizenship""  particularly  for  ethnic  minorities.  A  pilot  scheme  based  on  ceremonies  in  Australia  will  start  in  October.  Mr  Clarke  said  it  would  be  a  way  of  recognising  young  people  reaching  their  voting  age  when  they  also  gain  greater  independence  from  parents.  Britain's  young  black  and  Asian  people  are  to  be  encouraged  to  learn  about  the  nation's  heritage  as  part  of  the  government's  new  race  strategy  which  will  also  target  specific  issues  within  different  ethnic  minority  groups.  Officials  say  the  home  secretary  wants  young  people  to  feel  they  belong  and  to  understand  their  ""other  cultural  identities""  alongside  being  British.  The  launch  follows  a  row  about  the  role  of  faith  schools  in  Britain.  On  Monday  school  inspection  chief  David  Bell,  accused  some  Islamic  schools  of  failing  to  teach  pupils  about  their  obligations  to  British  society.  |||    The  Muslim  Council  of  Britain  said  Ofsted  boss  Mr  Bell's  comments  were  ""highly  irresponsible"".  The  Home  Office  started  work  on  its  Community  Cohesion  and  Race  Equality  Strategy  last  year  and  the  outcome,  launched  on  Wednesday,  is  called  'Improving  Opportunity,  Strengthening  Society'.  It  is  aimed  at  tackling  racism,  exclusion,  segregation  and  the  rise  in  political  and  religious  extremism.  ""It  represents  a  move  away  from  the  one-size-fits-all  approach  to  focus  on  specifics  within  cultural  groups,""  said  a  Home  Office  spokesman.  ""It  is  not  right  to  say  that  if  you  are  from  a  black  or  ethnic  minority  group  you  must  be  disadvantaged.""  The  spokesman  highlighted  specific  issues  that  affect  particular  communities  -  for  example  people  of  south  Asian  origin  tend  to  suffer  from  a  high  incidence  of  heart  disease.  |||    ""It  is  about  drilling  down  and  focusing  on  these  sorts  of  problems,""  the  spokesman  added.  Launching  the  initiative  Mr  Clarke  said  enormous  progress  had  been  made  on  race  issues  in  recent  years.  He  added:  ""But  while  many  members  of  black  and  minority  ethnic  communities  are  thriving,  some  may  still  find  it  harder  to  succeed  in  employment  or  gain  access  to  healthcare,  education  or  housing.  ""This  strategy  sets  out  the  government's  commitment  to  doing  more  to  identify  and  respond  to  the  specific  needs  of  minorities  in  our  society.""  Some  8%  of  the  UK  population  described  themselves  as  coming  from  a  non-white  ethnic  minority  in  the  2001  Census.  |||    The  Downing  Street  Strategy  Unit  in  2003  said  people  from  Indian  and  Chinese  backgrounds  were  doing  well  on  average,  often  outperforming  white  people  in  education  and  earnings.  But  those  of  Pakistani,  Bangladeshi  and  black  Caribbean  origin  were  significantly  more  likely  to  be  unemployed  and  earn  less  than  whites,  it  said.  The  Home  Office  wants  more  initiatives  which  try  to  promote  a  sense  of  belonging  by  encouraging  young  people  to  take  part  in  voluntary  work.  The  programmes  are  designed  to  support  the  citizenship  lessons  already  taking  place  in  schools." 

2	"Lib  Dems  target  first-time  buyers  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats  have  unveiled  plans  to  build  100,000  new  ""affordable""  homes  on  publicly  owned  land.  |||    The  party's  scheme  would  allow  people  to  buy  a  share  in  a  home  through  a  mutual  home  ownership  trust,  as  a  way  of  getting  onto  the  housing  ladder.  The  Lib  Dems  would  also  encourage  the  conversion  of  existing  buildings  in  an  effort  to  protect  greenfield  sites.  Labour  has  already  announced  plans  to  help  first-time  buyers  and  the  Tories  would  extend  right-to-buy  schemes.  |||    All  the  major  parties  are  focusing  on  the  issue  in  the  run-up  to  the  election  after  a  survey  suggested  first-time  buyers  could  not  afford  a  home  in  92%  of  UK  towns.  The  Lib  Dems  say  their  ""mutual  homes""  would  let  people  buy  a  share  of  a  property,  usually  worth  about  5%  of  the  building  costs.  Party  leader  Charles  Kennedy  said  the  homes  would  be  affordable  because  they  would  be  built  on  surplus  public  sector  land,  donated  by  central  or  local  government.  People  would  also  only  have  to  pay  for  the  cost  of  the  building  and  not  the  land,  he  added.  |||    They  would  spend  about  30%  of  their  monthly  salary  on  rent  and  buying  extra  shares  in  the  property.  When  they  moved  house,  they  would  be  able  to  cash  in  on  any  rise  in  property  prices  by  selling  their  share.  It  would  also  allow  councils  to  vary  discounts  to  tenants  given  the  right  to  buy  their  council  homes  so  local  needs  were  taken  into  account.  Mr  Kennedy  said:  ""Mutual  homes  will  offer  people  the  opportunity  to  build  up  an  equity  stake  in  a  home  gradually,  investing  only  as  much  as  they  can  afford.""  |||    There  are  also  plans  to  prevent  high  house  prices  forcing  people  out  of  their  local  communities.  The  kind  of  ""golden  share""  used  by  the  Lib  Dems  in  South  Shropshire  could  be  rolled  out  more  widely.  Under  the  plan,  councils  secure  deals  with  developers  where  they  keep  a  1%  share  in  a  property  scheme  so  properties  cannot  be  sold  on  the  open  market.  Instead,  they  are  sold  at  ""build  cost""  to  people  who  the  local  council  decides  have  local  needs.  The  party  says  its  help  for  first-time  buyers  can  be  funded  at  no  extra  cost  to  the  taxpayer.  But  the  plans  involve  changing  the  VAT  system,  which  the  party  says  often  makes  it  too  expensive  to  renovate  existing  buildings.  |||    The  Conservatives  claimed  the  plans  would  amount  to  an  extra  tax  of  up  to  £11,000  on  every  new  house.  ""This  is  typical  of  Lib  Dem  hypocrisy,""  said  Tory  shadow  local  government  secretary  Caroline  Spelman.  ""They  claim  that  they  want  to  help  people  on  to  the  property  ladder,  but  the  small  print  of  their  policies  reveal  how  they  intend  to  price  even  more  people  out  of  the  housing  market.""  The  flagship  Tory  proposal  on  housing  policy  is  to  give  a  million  more  housing  association  tenants  the  right  to  buy  their  homes.  Labour  has  said  it  will  allow  300,000  council  and  housing  association  tenants  to  buy  a  share  in  their  homes.  Housing  Minister  Keith  Hill  said  much  of  the  Lib  Dem  plans  mimicked  the  government's  strategy.  ""However,  as  usual,  the  Lib  Dems'  proposals  are  completely  uncosted,""  he  said.  Mr  Hill  said  he  also  asked  whether  the  Lib  Dems  would  match  Labour's  promise  to  spend  £42bn  on  making  refurbishing  and  repair  council  homes  by  2010." 

0	"J&J  agrees  $25bn  Guidant  deal  |||    Pharmaceutical  giant  Johnson  &  Johnson  has  agreed  to  buy  medical  technology  firm  Guidant  for  $25.4bn  (£13bn).  |||    Guidant  is  a  key  producer  of  equipment  that  combats  heart  problems  such  as  implant  defibrillators  and  pacemakers.  Analysts  said  that  the  deal  is  aimed  at  offsetting  Johnson  &  Johnson's  reliance  on  a  slowing  drug  business.  They  also  pointed  out  that  more  mergers  are  likely  because  the  drug  and  healthcare  industries  are  fragmented  and  are  under  pressure  to  cut  costs.  A  number  of  Johnson  &  Johnson's  products  are  facing  patent  expirations,  while  the  company  is  also  battling  fierce  competition  from  generic  products.  Meanwhile,  demand  for  defibrillators,  which  give  the  heart  a  small  electric  shock  when  an  irregular  heartbeat  or  rhythm  is  detected,  is  expected  to  increase,  analysts  said.  The  move  by  Johnson  &  Johnson  has  been  widely  expected  and  the  firm  will  pay  $76  for  each  Guidant  share,  6%  more  than  Wednesday's  closing  price.  Analysts  say  that  US  antitrust  regulators  could  force  the  firms  to  shed  some  overlapping  stent  operations.  Stents  are  tubes  that  are  used  to  keep  an  artery  open  after  it  has  been  unblocked." 

0	"India  unveils  anti-poverty  budget  |||    India  is  to  boost  spending  on  primary  schools  and  health  in  a  budget  flagged  as  a  boost  for  the  ordinary  citizen.  |||    India's  defence  budget  has  also  been  raised  7.8%  to  830bn  rupees  ($19bn).  The  priority  for  Finance  Minister  Palaniappan  Chidambaram  is  to  fight  poverty  and  keep  the  government's  Communist  allies  onside.  But  his  options  are  limited  by  a  new  law  which  makes  him  cut  the  budget  deficit,  which  he  said  would  be  4.5%  of  GDP  in  the  year  to  March  2005.  The  country's  overall  deficit  is  thought  to  be  more  than  10%,  if  the  spending  of  India's  35  states  and  territories  is  included.  Under  the  fiscal  responsibility  law,  Mr  Chidambaram  has  to  trim  the  deficit  by  0.3  percentage  points  each  year,  a  target  he  says  he  has  now  met  for  the  current  year.  |||    But  the  heavy  spending  on  poverty  reduction  means  the  2005-6  target  for  the  deficit  will  be  4.3%,  Mr  Chidambaram  said  -  falling  short  of  the  new  law's  requirement.  ""I  was  left  with  no  option  but  to  press  the  pause  button  vis  a  vis  the  act,""  he  said.  The  following  year,  though,  would  have  to  be  back  on  track,  he  warned.  |||    ""I  may  add  that  we  are  perilously  close  to  the  limits  of  fiscal  prudence  and  there  is  no  more  room  for  spending  beyond  our  means,""  he  said.  The  coming  year's  reduction  has  meant  bringing  more  of  the  businesses  in  India's  burgeoning  services  sector  into  the  tax  system  and  restructuring  the  personal  tax  system,  although  there  are  numerous  corporate  tax  and  duty  reductions  built  into  the  budget.  |||    Presenting  his  budget  in  the  lower  house  of  parliament,  Mr  Chidambaram  said  the  Indian  economy  was  performing  strongly  and  that  inflation  has  been  reined  in.  He  said  India's  economy  grew  6.9%  in  2004.  In  his  budget  Mr  Chidambaram  has:  |||    -  Increased  spending  on  primary  education  to  71.56bn  rupees  ($1.6bn)      -  Increased  spending  on  health  to  102.8bn  rupees  ($2.35bn)      -  Announced  that  80bn  rupees  ($1.8bn)  will  be  spent  on  building  rural  infrastructure      -  Pledged  102.16bn  rupees  ($2.3bn)  for  tsunami  victims      -  Increased  flow  of  funds  to  agriculture  by  30%      -  Announced  a  package  for  the  sugar  industry  |||    In  addition,  up  to  100bn  rupees  ($2.3bn)  to  be  spent  on  infrastructure  will  be  sourced  by  borrowing  against  the  country's  foreign  exchange  reserves,  keeping  budgeted  spending  under  control.  ""Given  the  resilience  of  the  Indian  economy...  it  is  possible  to  launch  a  direct  assault  on  poverty,""  Mr  Chidambaram  said.  ""The  whole  purpose  of  democratic  government  is  to  eliminate  poverty.""  The  new  Indian  government,  led  by  the  Congress  Party,  was  voted  into  power  last  May  after  it  pledged  to  introduce  economic  reforms  with  a  ""human  face"".  |||    The  finance  minister  says  he  is  committed  to  continue  reforming  India's  tax  system  while  expanding  the  tax  base.  As  part  of  his  reforms  he  has  announced:  |||    -  Duty  cuts  on  capital  goods  and  raw  materials      -  Expanded  service  tax  net      -  Raised  the  income-tax  threshold  to  100,000  rupees  ($2,300)      -  Reduced  income  tax  for  those  earning  less  than  250,000  rupees  ($5,700)  to  20%      -  Reduced  corporate  tax  rates  to  30%  |||    An  annual  economic  survey  released  on  Friday  said  India  needed  to  ease  limit  restriction  on  foreign  investment,  reform  labour  laws  and  cut  duties  apart  from  widening  the  tax  base  for  long-term  economic  growth.  But  Mr  Chidambaram  is  under  pressure  from  the  Communist  parties  to  focus  on  increasing  social  spending.  The  Communists  are  also  hostile  to  measures  seeking  to  increase  foreign  investment  and  allow  companies  to  hire  and  fire  employees  at  will.  In  recent  months,  they  have  expressed  their  displeasure  at  the  government's  economic  reform  plans  including  increasing  foreign  direct  investment  in  telecommunication  and  aviation.  In  his  last  budget,  Mr  Chidambaram  had  pledged  billions  of  dollars  for  improving  education  and  health  services  for  the  poor  as  well  as  special  assistance  for  farmers." 

0	"BMW  to  recall  faulty  diesel  cars  |||    BMW  is  to  recall  all  cars  equipped  with  a  faulty  diesel  fuel-injection  pump  supplied  by  parts  maker  Robert  Bosch.  |||    The  faulty  part  does  not  represent  a  safety  risk  and  the  recall  only  affects  pumps  made  in  December  and  January.  BMW  said  that  it  was  too  early  to  say  how  many  cars  were  affected  or  how  much  the  recall  would  cost.  The  German  company  is  to  extend  a  planned  production  break  at  one  of  its  plants  due  to  the  faulty  Bosch  part.  The  Dingolfing  site  will  now  be  closed  all  next  week  instead  of  for  just  two  days.  The  additional  three-day  stoppage  will  mean  a  production  loss  of  up  to  3,600  vehicles,  BMW  said,  adding  that  it  was  confident  it  could  make  up  the  numbers  later.  |||    Bosch  has  stopped  production  of  the  part  but  expects  to  restart  by  2  February.  The  faulty  component  does  not  represent  a  safety  risk  but  causes  the  motor  to  stall  after  a  significant  amount  of  mileage.  When  asked  if  BMW  would  be  seeking  compensation  from  Bosch,  the  carmaker's  chief  executive  Helmut  Panke  said:  ""we  will  first  solve  the  problem  before  talking  about  who  will  pay"".  Audi  and  Mercedes  Benz  were  also  supplied  with  the  defective  diesel  fuel-injection  pumps  but  neither  of  them  have  to  recall  any  vehicles.  A  spokesman  for  DaimlerChrysler,  parent  company  of  Mercedes  Benz,  said  it  will  however  have  to  halt  some  production.  It  is  to  close  the  Mercedes  factory  in  Sindelfingen  on  Monday  and  Tuesday.  Audi  said  it  had  been  hit  by  production  bottlenecks,  due  to  a  shortage  of  unaffected  Bosch  parts."

The  move  follows  a  decision  earlier  this  month  by  Anil  -  the  younger  brother  of  Reliance  Group  president  Mukesh  Ambani  -  to  resign  from  his  post.  His  resignation  was  not  accepted  by  his  brother,  who  is  also  the  boss  of  IPCL.  The  IPCL  board  met  in  Mumbai  to  discuss  the  company's  results  for  the  October-to-December  quarter.  |||    It  is  understood  that  the  board  also  considered  Anil's  resignation  and  asked  him  to  reconsider  his  decision.  However,  Anil's  demand  that  Anand  Jain  -  another  IPCL  board  member  accused  by  Anil  of  creating  a  rift  in  the  Ambani  family  -  be  thrown  out,  was  not  met.  Anil  has  accused  Anand  Jain,  a  confidant  of  his  brother  Mukesh,  of  playing  a  negative  role  in  the  Ambani  family,  and  being  responsible  for  the  trouble  between  the  brothers.  On  Wednesday,  the  board  of  Reliance  Energy,  another  Reliance  Group  company,  reaffirmed  its  faith  in  Anil,  who  is  the  company's  chief.  Reliance  Group  acquired  the  government's  26%  stake  in  IPCL  -  India's  second-largest  petrochemicals  company  -  in  2002,  as  part  of  the  privatisation  drive.  Meanwhile,  the  group's  flagship  company,  Reliance  Industries,  has  its  board  meeting  on  Friday  to  consider  its  financial  results.  Mukesh  is  the  company's  chairman  and  Anil  its  deputy,  and  it  is  expected  that  both  brothers  will  come  face  to  face  in  the  meeting.  The  Ambani  family  controls  48%  of  the  group,  which  is  worth  $17bn  (£9.1bn;  745bn  Indian  rupees).  It  was  founded  by  their  father,  Dhiru  Bhai  Ambani,  who  died  two  years  ago."

The  sequel  follows  the  master  criminals  as  they  try  to  pull  off  three  major  heists  across  Europe.  It  knocked  last  week's  number  one,  National  Treasure,  into  third  place.  Wesley  Snipes'  Blade:  Trinity  was  in  second,  taking  $16.1m  (£8.4m).  Rounding  out  the  top  five  was  animated  fable  The  Polar  Express,  starring  Tom  Hanks,  and  festive  comedy  Christmas  with  the  Kranks.  |||    Ocean's  Twelve  box  office  triumph  marks  the  fourth-biggest  opening  for  a  December  release  in  the  US,  after  the  three  films  in  the  Lord  of  the  Rings  trilogy.  The  sequel  narrowly  beat  its  2001  predecessor,  Ocean's  Eleven  which  took  $38.1m  (£19.8m)  on  its  opening  weekend  and  $184m  (£95.8m)  in  total.  A  remake  of  the  1960s  film,  starring  Frank  Sinatra  and  the  Rat  Pack,  Ocean's  Eleven  was  directed  by  Oscar-winning  director  Steven  Soderbergh.  Soderbergh  returns  to  direct  the  hit  sequel  which  reunites  Clooney,  Pitt  and  Roberts  with  Matt  Damon,  Andy  Garcia  and  Elliott  Gould.  Catherine  Zeta-Jones  joins  the  all-star  cast.  ""It's  just  a  fun,  good  holiday  movie,""  said  Dan  Fellman,  president  of  distribution  at  Warner  Bros.  However,  US  critics  were  less  complimentary  about  the  $110m  (£57.2m)  project,  with  the  Los  Angeles  Times  labelling  it  a  ""dispiriting  vanity  project"".  A  milder  review  in  the  New  York  Times  dubbed  the  sequel  ""unabashedly  trivial""."

Miner  Highland  Gold  said  it  regretted  any  limit  on  privatisation  while  BP,  a  big  investor,  declined  to  comment.  Only  firms  at  least  51%  Russian-owned  will  be  permitted  to  bid.  |||    The  Federal  Natural  Resources  Agency  said  ""the  government  is  interested  in  letting  Russian  companies  develop  strategic  resources"".  The  foreign  ownership  issue  will  be  dealt  with  according  to  Russia's  competition  law,  natural  resources  minister  Yuri  Trutnev  was  quoted  as  saying  by  the  Interfax  news  agency.  No  further  details  were  given,  with  Mr  Trutnev  suggesting  that  Russia  may  decide  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Observers  said  that  the  move  may  represent  a  shift  in  policy,  as  the  administration  of  Vladimir  Putin  puts  the  protection  of  national  interests  above  free  market  dynamics.  Russia  recently  wrested  back  control  of  a  large  chunk  of  its  oil  industry  from  stock-market  listed  company  Yukos,  a  move  that  prompted  calls  of  outrage  from  many  investors.  |||    Analysts  warned  that  it  was  still  too  early  to  draw  too  many  conclusions  from  this  new  set  of  proposals.  |||    Companies  echoed  this  sentiment,  saying  that  they  would  require  more  information  before  ringing  the  alarm  bells.  ""It's  not  good.  But  it  is  very  understandable,""  said  Al  Breach,  an  economist  at  UBS  Brunswick.  ""But  if  the  investment  climate  is  stable  -  that's  much  more  important.  ""Foreigners  of  course  would  like  to  have  free  entry  but...  this  is  not  the  end  of  the  world.""  A  number  of  other  nations,  including  Mexico,  Saudi  Arabia  and  Kuwait,  protect  their  national  resources  from  foreign  firms.  What  has  surprised  observers  is  that  since  the  collapse  of  communism  Russia  has  been  courting  foreign  investment.  |||    BP  spent  $7.5bn  to  create  Russian-registered  oil  company  TNK-BP,  and  has  a  partnership  to  develop  the  Sakhalin  5  petroleum  field  with  state-owned  Rosneft.  Exxon,  the  world's  largest  oil  company,  has  signed  preliminary  agreements  to  develop  the  Sakhalin  3  field.  Company  spokesman  Glenn  Waller  said  Exxon  still  considered  the  deal  valid,  despite  Russia  inviting  new  offers  for  the  land  block.  According  to  Mr  Waller,  Exxon  ""were  not  planning  to  bid  at  a  new  tender  anyway"".  ""We  regret  the  ministry  has  taken  such  a  decision,""  said  Ivan  Kulakov,  deputy  chairman  of  Highland  Gold  -  a  mining  firm  that  has  the  motto  ""Bringing  Russia's  Gold  to  Market"".  ""It  would  be  a  shame  if  that  has  a  negative  impact  on  the  investment  climate.""  Other  firms  that  have  been  linked  with  investment  in  Russia  include  France's  Total,  the  US-based  ChevronTexaco,  and  miner  Barrick  Gold."

The  German  economy  has  been  faltering,  with  unemployment  levels  rising  to  a  seventy-year  high  of  5.2  million.  Its  sluggish  performance  continues  to  hamper  the  entire  eurozone.  |||    The  IMF's  draft  World  Economic  Outlook  -  due  to  be  published  in  April  -  would  point  to  a  marked  deterioration  in  Germany's  economy,  the  FT  report  said.  |||    In  September,  the  IMF  had  said  that  German  growth  for  the  current  year  would  be  1.8%.  The  IMF  has  also  revised  eurozone  forecasts,  the  paper  said,  taking  into  account  high  oil  prices,  the  strength  of  the  euro  and  weak  demand  in  many  of  the  world's  leading  economies.  Europe's  economic  difficulties  have  been  highlighted  by  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development,  which  argued  in  a  report  published  on  Tuesday  that  the  continent  could  only  achieve  US  living  standards  by  freeing  up  its  labour  markets.  ""The  eurozone  does  not  look  like  it  has  a  self-sustaining  recovery,""  James  Carrick,  an  economist  with  ABN  Amro,  told  the  newspaper.  ""It  is  too  dependant  on  the  rest  of  the  world.""" 

2	"Tories  opposing  24-hour  drinking  |||    The  Tories  say  plans  to  extend  pub  opening  times  should  be  put  on  hold  until  binge  drinking  is  under  control,  despite  backing  a  law  change  last  year.  |||    Spokesman  David  Davis  said  ministers  had  failed  to  make  his  party  aware  of  concern  among  senior  police  that  plans  would  cause  more  anti-social  behaviour.  Notts  police  chief  Steve  Green  said  innocent  people  would  suffer.  But  Culture  Secretary  Tessa  Jowell  said  a  delay  would  be  ""disastrous""  and  she  accused  the  Tories  of  opportunism.  The  government  would  go  ahead  with  the  changes  which  would  give  police  more  power  to  tackle  excessive  drinking,  she  added.  Earlier  chief  constable  Green  questioned  how  his  officers  would  be  able  to  practically  apply  powers  allowing  them  to  shut  down  problem  premises.  ""If  you  look  at  the  Market  Square  in  Nottingham,  if  a  fight  takes  place  which  licensed  premises  do  you  go  and  lay  the  responsibilty  at  the  door  of?""  he  asked  on  BBC  Radio  4's  World  at  One  programme.  |||    He  warned  that  if  drinking  establishments  were  allowed  to  open  until  three  or  four  in  the  morning  the  police  would  have  to  take  officers  off  day  shifts  in  order  to  do  their  job  effectively  at  night.  Earlier  this  year  the  Royal  College  of  Physicians  said  it  opposed  the  plan  to  extend  drinking  hours  when  there  was  already  an  ""epidemic""  of  binge  drinking.  Minister  Richard  Caborn  said  the  government  was  tackling  the  causes  and  the  symptoms  of  the  problem  by  allowing  more  powers  to  close  down  problem  premises.  It  is  hoped  that  allowing  pubs  and  clubs  to  stay  open  longer  will  stagger  closing  times  and  end  the  current  situation  where  drinkers  spill  on  to  the  streets  all  at  once.  Earlier  Tony  Blair  defended  the  plans  against  criticism  from  one  of  his  own  backbenchers.  |||    ""My  view  of  this  is  very  clear:  we  should  have  the  same  flexibility  that  other  countries  have  and  then  we  should  come  down  really  hard  on  those  who  abuse  that  freedom  and  don't  show  the  responsibility,""  he  told  MPs.  ""The  law-abiding  majority  who  want  the  ability,  after  going  to  the  cinema  or  theatre  say,  to  have  a  drink  at  the  time  they  want  should  not  be  inconvenienced,  we  shouldn't  have  to  have  restrictions  that  no  other  city  in  Europe  has,  just  in  order  to  do  something  for  that  tiny  minority  who  abuse  alcohol,  who  go  out  and  fight  and  cause  disturbances.  ""To  take  away  that  ability  for  all  the  population  -  even  the  vast  majority  who  are  law  abiding  -  is  not,  in  my  view,  sensible.""  This  week  a  judge  claimed  easy  access  to  drink  was  breeding  ""urban  savages""  and  turning  town  centres  into  no  go  areas.  Judge  Charles  Harris  QC  made  his  remarks  as  he  sentenced  three  men  for  assaults  carried  out  while  drunk  and  high  on  drugs  after  a  night  out." 

2	"Galloway  targets  'New  Labour'  MP  |||    George  Galloway  is  to  stand  against  pro-Iraq  war  Labour  MP  Oona  King  at  the  next  general  election.  |||    Mr  Galloway,  who  on  Thursday  won  £150,000  in  libel  damages  from  the  Daily  Telegraph  said  he  would  contest  Bethnal  Green,  in  London,  for  Respect.  The  Glasgow  Kelvin  MP,  who  was  expelled  from  Labour  over  his  anti  Iraq  war  stance,  accused  Ms  King  of  being  a  ""New  Labour  stooge"".  Ms  King  said  she  was  ""delighted""  at  the  chance  to  take  on  Mr  Galloway.  |||    Mr  Galloway's  current  constituency  is  set  to  disappear  under  planned  boundary  changes  in  Scotland.  |||    The  50-year-old  MP  launched  Respect,  the  Unity  Coalition,  in  January  along  with  1,000  anti-war  activists,  and  the  Muslim  Association  of  Britain.  The  party's  declared  aims  are  an  end  to  the  occupation  of  Iraq,  the  repeal  of  anti-union  laws  and  the  end  of  privatisation.  Speaking  from  a  cafe  in  Brick  Lane,  east  London,  Mr  Galloway  said  he  had  accepted  the  party's  invitation  to  stand  with  ""great  honour  and  pride"".  |||    He  added:  ""Here  in  this  constituency  of  Bethnal  Green  and  Bow  there  is  a  New  Labour  stooge  MP.  ""A  stooge  who  will  sing  any  song,  make  any  speech,  do  any  dance,  do  anything  she  is  told  to  by  Tony  Blair  -  irrespective  of  how  her  constituents  are  adversely  affected  or  how  strongly  they  feel  to  the  contrary.""  Ms  King  has  represented  the  constituency  since  1997.  She  said:  ""I'm  delighted  I've  been  given  the  chance  to  finish  him  (Mr  Galloway)  off,  and  believe  me  I  will.  ""I  know  many  people  around  the  country  will  be  grateful,  not  least  his  constituents  in  Scotland  who  he  has  shamelessly  abandoned.""  In  June's  European  Parliament  elections,  Respect  failed  to  gain  enough  votes  for  an  MEP  but  did  come  first  in  Tower  Hamlets  borough,  most  of  which  is  covered  by  the  Commons  constituency  of  Bethnal  Green  and  Bow.  |||    A  month  later  it  gained  a  council  seat  in  a  by-election  in  St  Dunstan's  and  Stepney  Green  ward,  Tower  Hamlets.  Mr  Galloway  said  that  in  next  year's  expected  general  election  and  local  elections  a  year  later,  the  party  would  ""turn  the  East  End  of  London  into  a  fortress"".  Both  the  Conservatives  and  the  Liberal  Democrats  have  chosen  prospective  parliamentary  candidates  for  Bethnal  Green  and  Bow  from  the  Bangladeshi  population,  which  makes  up  almost  half  the  electorate.  The  Telegraph  was  sued  for  libel  by  Mr  Galloway  after  the  newspaper  claimed  he  received  money  from  Saddam  Hussein's  regime  in  Iraq.  The  newspaper  said  it  was  in  the  public  interest  to  publish  the  claims,  based  on  documents  found  in  Baghdad.  Mr  Justice  Eady  said  he  was  ""obliged  to  compensate  Mr  Galloway...  and  to  make  an  award  for  the  purposes  of  restoring  his  reputation""." 

0	"Ebbers  denies  WorldCom  fraud  |||    Former  WorldCom  chief  Bernie  Ebbers  has  denied  claims  that  he  knew  accountants  were  doctoring  the  books  at  the  firm.  |||    Speaking  in  court,  Mr  Ebbers  rejected  allegations  he  pressured  ex-chief  financial  officer  Scott  Sullivan  to  falsify  company  financial  statements.  Mr  Sullivan  ""made  accounting  decisions,""  he  told  the  federal  court,  saying  his  finance  chief  had  ""a  keen  command  of  the  numbers"".  Mr  Ebbers  has  denied  charges  of  fraud  and  conspiracy.  During  his  second  day  of  questioning  in  the  New  York  trial  Mr  Ebbers  played  down  his  working  relationship  with  Mr  Sullivan  and  denied  he  frequently  met  him  to  discuss  company  business  when  questioned  by  the  prosecution.  |||    ""In  a  lot  of  weeks,  we  would  speak  ...  three  or  four  times,""  Mr  Ebbers  said,  adding  that  conversations  about  finances  were  rarely  one-on-one  and  were  usually  discussed  by  a  ""group  of  people""  instead.  |||    Mr  Ebbers  relationship  to  Mr  Sullivan  is  key  to  the  case  surrounding  financial  corruption  that  led  to  the  collapse  of  the  firm  in  2002  following  the  discovery  of  an  $11bn  accounting  fraud.  The  prosecution's  star  witness  is  Mr  Sullivan,  one  of  six  WorldCom  executives  indicted  in  the  case,  He  has  pleaded  guilty  to  fraud  and  appeared  as  a  prosecution  witness  as  part  of  an  agreement  with  prosecutors.  During  his  time  on  the  witness  stand  Mr  Sullivan  repeatedly  told  jurors  he  met  frequently  with  Mr  Ebbers,  told  him  about  changes  made  to  WorldCom's  accounts  to  hide  costs  and  had  warned  him  such  practises  were  improper.  However  during  the  case  on  Tuesday  Mr  Ebbers  denied  the  allegations.  ""I  wasn't  advised  by  Scott  Sullivan  of  anything  ever  being  wrong,""  he  told  the  court.  ""He's  never  told  me  he  made  an  entry  that  wasn't  right.  If  he  had,  we  wouldn't  be  here  today.""  Mr  Ebbers  could  face  a  jail  sentence  of  up  to  85  years  if  convicted  of  all  the  charges  he  is  facing.  Shareholders  lost  about  $180bn  in  WorldCom's  collapse,  20,000  workers  lost  their  jobs  and  the  company  went  bankrupt.  The  company  emerged  from  bankruptcy  last  year  and  is  now  known  as  MCI." 

2	"Guantanamo  four  questioned  |||    The  four  Britons  freed  from  US  custody  in  Guantanamo  Bay  are  expected  to  be  allowed  a  visit  by  one  relative.  |||    Moazzam  Begg,  Martin  Mubanga,  Feroz  Abbasi  and  Richard  Belmar  were  held  for  three  years,  accused  of  al-Qaeda  links.  Mr  Begg's  father,  Azmat,  said  he  had  been  told  he  could  see  his  son  for  20  minutes  and  would  say  he  was  ""a  hero"".  The  men  are  being  held  at  London's  Paddington  Green  police  station,  where  they  are  expected  to  be  questioned  by  UK  anti-terror  officers.  But  Louise  Christian,  the  lawyer  representing  Mr  Abbasi  and  Mr  Mubanga,  said  the  families  would  be  reunited  with  the  men  away  from  the  station.  Before  being  driven  by  police  from  Birmingham  to  London,  Azmat  Begg  said  he  was  concerned  for  his  son  Moazzam's  mental  state  and  was  looking  forward  to  giving  him  a  hug.  As  Azmat  Begg  arrived  at  the  London  police  station,  there  appeared  to  be  some  confusion  as  to  the  visiting  arrangements.  Police  have  said  they  have  a  duty  to  investigate  the  men,  who  were  arrested  on  their  return  to  the  UK.  But  Metropolitan  Police  Commissioner  Sir  John  Stevens  said  evidence  obtained  by  MI5  while  the  four  were  in  Cuba  was  ""absolutely""  inadmissible  in  UK  courts.  In  an  interview  with  the  Independent,  Sir  John  said  his  officers  would  have  to  find  other  evidence  before  the  suspects  could  be  tried  in  the  UK.  |||    He  told  the  newspaper:  ""If  an  admission  is  made,  it  is  a  totally  different  ball  game...  it  could  be  used  as  evidence.  ""The  options  are:  if  there  is  enough  evidence  they  will  be  charged.  If  not  they  will  be  released  as  soon  as  possible.""  The  men  have  been  allowed  to  meet  their  lawyers.  Louise  Christian  said  that  after  being  ""tortured  and  abused""  at  Guantanamo  Bay,  the  men's  arrest  was  unfair  and  inappropriate.  She  told  BBC  News  she  remained  very  concerned  about  their  psychological  state.  Gareth  Peirce,  lawyer  for  Mr  Begg,  said  she  was  shocked  at  the  condition  of  the  men  and  appalled  that  the  authorities  felt  the  need  to  detain  them.  Washington  has  claimed  all  four  were  ""enemy  combatants""  who  trained  at  camps  run  by  al-Qaeda.  The  Pentagon  says  they  were  freed  after  the  UK  government  promised  they  would  not  be  a  threat  to  the  national  security  of  the  US  or  any  of  its  allies.  |||    The  detainees  were  immediately  arrested  under  Section  41  of  the  Terrorism  Act  2000  when  they  landed  at  RAF  Northolt,  west  London,  on  Tuesday.  Massoud  Shadjareh,  from  the  Muslim  Safety  Forum,  said:  ""What  sort  of  homecoming  is  this?  They  are  innocent  people.""  The  Muslim  Council  of  Britain  urged  that  the  men  should  receive  counselling  and  medical  help.  ""We  want  these  men  to  be  returned  into  the  arms  of  their  waiting  family,""  said  Iqbal  Sacranie,  secretary  general  of  the  council." 

2	"UKIP  MEP  attacked  German  'empire'  |||    A  UK  Independence  Party  MEP  suggested  Germany  saw  the  EU  as  an  'empire'  and  was  cheaper  than  using  tanks,  a  new  documentary  has  revealed.  Mike  Nattrass,  UKIP's  deputy  leader,  made  the  comments  to  an  audience  at  a  meeting  during  last  September's  Hartlepool  by-election  campaign.  But  challenged  on  the  remark,  he  denied  accusing  Germany  of  using  the  EU  as  cover  for  a  ""4th  German  Reich"".  He  says  he  was  not  ""German-bashing""  but  saying  peace  was  the  EU's  founding  aim.  The  meeting  was  shown  in  a  BBC  3  film  on  ex-UKIP  MEP  Robert  Kilroy-Silk.  The  former  chat  show  host  quit  the  party  earlier  this  month,  calling  it  a  joke.  |||    The  documentary  showed  Mr  Nattrass,  apparently  talking  about  the  EU,  telling  the  meeting:  ""The  Germans  are  the  big  losers  here  but  they  don't  care  because  to  them  the  project  is  worthwhile.  ""It's  like  an  empire  for  them  spreading  in  all  directions  away  from  Germany  into  Hungary,  into  what  they  call  the  Sudetenland  -  Czechoslovakia,  places  like  that.  ""So  it's  cheaper  for  them  to  do  it  this  way  than  roll  the  tanks  in.""  On  Tuesday,  he  told  the  BBC  News  website  he  did  not  think  the  comments  were  offensive  and  worked  happily  with  MEPs  of  different  nationalities  in  the  European  Parliament.  He  argued  that  peace  was  the  only  reason  for  having  the  ""outdated""  EU  as  there  was  no  economic  justification.  Pointing  to  Germany's  trade  interests  as  a  country  in  the  centre  of  Europe,  Mr  Nattrass  said:  ""The  fact  is  that  the  EU  benefits  Germany  but  it  does  not  benefit  Britain.  ""I'm  not  at  all  German-bashing.  It's  the  truth.""  A  UKIP  spokesman  said:  ""Mike  has  some  passionate  beliefs  and  sometimes  uses  excessively  colourful  language  with  which  to  express  them.""  |||    The  documentary  showed  some  of  the  tensions  between  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  and  his  fellow  MEPs  after  UKIP  took  third  place  in  last  year's  European  elections.  He  denied  wanting  to  be  leader  until  October  2004,  when  he  told  BBC  One's  Breakfast  with  Frost  programme  he  aspired  to  the  job.  Asked  by  the  documentary  makers  why  he  had  lied  about  his  leadership  ambitions,  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  said:  ""There  was  one  thing  I  said  that  I  shouldn't  have  said  at  the  time.  ""I  was  trying  to  be  helpful  to  the  party  and  it  was  the  wrong  thing  to  do,  I  should  have  told  the  truth.""  The  film  also  included  footage  of  a  row  between  Mr  Kilroy-Silk,  MEP  Nigel  Farage  and  party  leader  Roger  Knapman  about  rumours  that  he  was  about  to  resign  the  UKIP  whip  in  the  European  Parliament.  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  told  them  he  had  not  left  the  UKIP  group  -  a  move  he  announced  shortly  after  the  meeting.  He  told  Mr  Farage:  ""Don't  tell  lies  Nigel,  now  you've  told  too  many.  Most  of  the  trouble  had  been  caused  by  you.""  UKIP  officials  claim  it  was  in  fact  Mr  Kilroy-Silk,  not  Mr  Farage,  who  briefed  newspapers  he  was  leaving  the  group  of  MEPs.  |||    Later  in  unguarded,  off-air  comments  in  a  television  studio,  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  was  heard  saying  he  was  irritated  by  ""defending  some  of  these  right-wing  fascist  nutters"".  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  separately  said  he  had  argued  against  UKIP  working  with  such  groups  which  believed  homosexuality  was  a  sin.  A  UKIP  spokesman  said  there  were  more  than  40  MEPs  in  the  same  group  in  the  European  Parliament.  They  were  from  a  broad  spectrum  -  some  right-wing,  some  left-wing  -  but  with  a  shared  belief  in  the  ""unfeasibility  of  the  EU  as  it  is  now"".  He  did  not  defend  other  groups'  religious  beliefs  but  argued  it  was  their  right  to  hold  such  views  -  just  as  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  had  a  right  to  criticise  Arab  states.  London  UKIP  MEP  Gerard  Batten  said:  ""Robert  has  made  a  variety  of  comments  about  UKIP  and  its  MEPs.  ""There  are  of  course  two  sides  to  every  story.  What  Robert  does  not  say  is  that  he  was  offered  several  positions  which  would  have  given  him  effective  control  of  the  party,  but  not  the  title  of  leader.""  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  is  to  launch  his  own  parry,  Veritas,  in  Westminster  on  Wednesday."

The  legal  action  accuses  Mr  Spector  of  murdering  the  actress  at  his  LA  home.  Mr  Spector  is  currently  free  on  $1m  (£535,000)  bail  and  is  awaiting  trial.  The  64-year-old  has  denied  the  killing,  saying  her  death  was  accidental.  |||    Ms  Clarkson's  legal  action,  filed  in  Los  Angeles  Superior  Court,  also  accuses  Mr  Spector  of  negligence  and  battery,  alleging  he  ""grabbed,  hit,  fought  with  and  restrained""  Lana  Clarkson  before  shooting  her  to  death.  Her  lawyers  said  in  a  statement:  ""The  Clarkson  family  had  hoped  that  there  would  be  some  resolution  with  regard  to  the  criminal  proceedings  before  moving  forward  with  the  civil  action.  ""However,  Ms  Clarkson  and  her  family  understand  that  the  fair  administration  of  justice  takes  time  and  in  light  of  the  numerous  changes  Mr  Spector  has  made  in  his  legal  defence  team  over  the  last  two  years,  Ms  Clarkson  was  forced  to  file  the  action  before  (the  statute  of  limitations  expired)  on  3  February  2005.""  Mr  Spector,  known  for  his  work  with  the  Beatles,  has  claimed  that  Lana  Clarkson  committed  suicide.  His  lawyers,  led  by  Bruce  Cutler,  have  vowed  to  prove  him  innocent  at  trial.  |||    Mr  Cutler  said:  ""Phil  did  not  cause  the  death  of  this  woman,  he's  not  criminally  responsible  and  he's  not  civilly  responsible  either.  ""But  I'm  not  surprised  they  filed  a  suit  for  money,  that  seems  to  be  de  rigueur  nowadays.""  A  Los  Angeles  Superior  Court  judge  is  expected  to  set  a  trial  date  later  this  month  for  Spector,  who  was  indicted  on  murder  charges  in  September.  Roderick  Lindblom,  one  of  Ms  Clarkson's  lawyers,  said:  ""Our  intent  is  to  let  the  criminal  proceedings  go  forward  and  not  do  anything  that  would  interfere  with  the  prosecution."""

Born  in  Runcorn,  Cheshire,  she  also  starred  in  numerous  films  including  1989's  Shirley  Valentine.  She  played  Nellie  in  Mike  Leigh's  latest  film  Vera  Drake,  which  won  the  Golden  Lion  prize  for  best  film  at  this  year's  Venice  Film  Festival.  |||    And  most  recently  she  appeared  alongside  Richard  Wilson  in  ITV's  King  of  Fridges  and  with  Martin  Clunes  in  Doc  Martin.  Other  TV  appearances  included  the  part  of  Matron  in  ITV  drama  Footballers'  Wives  and  a  cameo  role  as  Tom  Farrell's  mother  Sheila  in  BBC  comedy  Gimme  Gimme  Gimme.  Keaveney's  career  also  included  stage  performances  in  Neaptide  for  the  National  Theatre,  Private  Lives  and  The  Rise  and  Fall  of  Little  Voice.  The  actress  died  in  hospital.  Her  agent  Barry  Brown  said:  ""Anna  was  due  to  have  had  another  operation  on  Friday  but  unfortunately  she  was  too  weak.""" 

1	"Tough  schedule  delays  Elliot  show  |||    Preview  performances  of  the  £3m  musical  Billy  Elliot  have  been  delayed  to  give  the  child  actors  a  less  arduous  rehearsal  schedule.  |||    Director  Stephen  Daldry  made  the  decision  to  re-schedule  the  previews  to  protect  the  young  stars.  Three  boys  will  rotate  the  demanding  role  of  ballet  dancer  Billy,  which  requires  them  to  sing,  dance  and  act.  The  show's  opening  night  on  12  May  at  the  Victoria  Palace  Theatre  in  London  remains  unaffected  by  the  changes.  Preview  performances  will  now  be  held  on  14,  20  and  27  April.  ""This  is  one  of  the  most  ambitious  projects  I  have  been  involved  with,""  said  Daldry.  ""The  decision  has  been  made  to  push  back  our  preview  performances  in  order  to  give  our  company,  with  a  cast  including  45  children,  a  little  extra  time  so  they  are  as  fully  prepared  as  possible.""  |||    He  added:  ""The  young  Billy  Elliots  in  particular,  making  their  professional  stage  debuts  in  the  West  End,  will  benefit  from  a  little  extra  time  to  familiarise  themselves  with  all  aspects  of  the  production.""  |||    The  three  boys  playing  Billy  are  James  Lomas,  15,  George  Maguire,  14,  and  Liam  Mower,  12.  The  other  major  child  parts  will  also  be  rotated  between  young  actors.  Such  are  the  demands  of  the  show  that  producers  set  up  a  stage  school  in  Newcastle  to  train  potential  stars  for  the  show.  Child  labour  laws  also  mean  the  young  actors  can  only  work  for  a  limited  period  each  week.  Adult  actors  in  the  show  include  Tim  Healy  as  Billy's  father  and  Haydn  Gwnne  as  his  dance  teacher  Mrs  Wilkinson.  Sir  Elton  John  has  composed  the  music.  Daldry  directed  the  successful  film  version  of  Billy  Elliot,  adapted  from  Lee  Hall's  script.  Both  were  nominated  for  Oscars,  alongside  Julie  Walters,  who  played  Billy's  teacher."

""I  told  the  club  I  would  like  to  stay  for  one  more  year.  They  promised  me  an  answer  within  the  next  month  so  I  am  waiting  to  see,""  he  said.  ""The  main  concern  is  my  age  but  I  think  I  have  proved  I  am  fit  enough.  Bosvelt  joined  City  from  Feyenoord  in  2003  and  at  first  he  struggled  to  adapt  to  life  in  England.  But  his  professionalism  and  dedication  impressed  manager  Kevin  Keegan.  ""He  realised  the  pace  of  the  game  was  faster  than  anything  he  was  used  to  but  he  drove  himself  back  into  the  team.  He  is  an  unsung  hero,""  said  Keegan."

Mull  Historical  Society,  Deacon  Blue,  Idlewild,  Texas,  Mogwai  and  Teenage  Fanclub  are  among  the  other  acts  performing  at  the  concert.  Organisers  hope  to  raise  at  least  £250,000  from  the  show.  |||    It  follows  a  Cardiff  gig  starring  Eric  Clapton,  Keane  and  Jools  Holland,  which  raised  more  than  £1.25m.  And  it  is  taking  place  on  the  same  night  as  a  tsunami  benefit  show  in  Bristol,  which  will  see  Massive  Attack  and  Portishead  share  a  stage  for  the  first  time.  Colin  MacIntyre,  of  Mull  Historical  Society,  was  playing  another  gig  on  the  same  day  but  said  he  was  determined  to  make  the  Glasgow  benefit.  He  said:  ""I  think  we  were  all  affected  by  seeing  the  reports  coming  from  the  Far  East.

0	"Aids  and  climate  top  Davos  agenda  |||    Climate  change  and  the  fight  against  Aids  are  leading  the  list  of  concerns  for  the  first  day  of  the  World  Economic  Forum  in  the  Swiss  resort  of  Davos.  |||    Some  2,000  business  and  political  leaders  from  around  the  globe  will  listen  to  UK  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair's  opening  speech  on  Wednesday.  Mr  Blair  will  focus  on  Africa's  development  plans  and  global  warming.  Earlier  in  the  day  came  an  update  on  efforts  to  have  3  million  people  on  anti-Aids  drugs  by  the  end  of  2005.  The  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  said  700,000  people  in  poor  countries  were  on  life-extending  drugs  -  up  from  440,000  six  months  earlier  but  amounting  to  only  12%  of  the  5.8  million  who  needed  them.  A  $2bn  ""funding  gap""  still  stood  in  the  way  of  hitting  the  2005  target,  the  WHO  said.  |||    The  themes  to  be  stressed  by  Mr  Blair  -  whose  attendance  was  announced  at  the  last  minute  -  are  those  he  wants  to  dominate  the  UK's  chairmanship  of  the  G8  group  of  industrialised  states.  Other  issues  to  be  discussed  at  the  five-day  conference  range  from  China's  |||    economic  power  to  Iraq's  future  after  this  Sunday's  elections.  Aside  from  Mr  Blair,  more  than  20  other  world  leaders  are  expected  to  attend  including  French  President  Jacques  Chirac  -  due  to  speak  by  video  link  after  bad  weather  delayed  his  helicopter  -  and  South  African  President  Thabo  Mbeki,  whose  arrival  has  been  delayed  by  Ivory  Coast  peace  talks.  The  Ukraine's  new  president,  Viktor  Yushchenko,  will  also  be  there  -  as  will  newly  elected  Palestinian  leader  Mahmoud  Abbas.  Showbiz  figures  will  also  put  in  an  appearance,  from  U2  frontman  Bono  -  a  well-known  campaigner  on  trade  and  development  issues  -  to  Angelina  Jolie,  a  goodwill  campaigner  for  the  UN  on  refugees.  |||    Unlike  previous  years,  protests  against  the  WEF  are  expected  to  be  muted.  Anti-globalisation  campaigners  have  called  off  a  demonstration  planned  for  the  weekend.  At  the  same  time,  about  100,000  people  are  expected  to  converge  on  the  Brazilian  resort  of  Porto  Alegre  for  the  World  Social  Forum  -  the  so-called  ""anti-Davos""  for  campaigners  against  globalisation,  for  fair  trade,  and  many  other  causes.  |||    In  contrast,  the  Davos  forum  is  dominated  by  business  issues  -  from  outsourcing  to  corporate  leadership  -  with  bosses  of  more  than  a  fifth  of  the  world's  500  largest  companies  scheduled  to  attend.  A  survey  published  on  the  eve  of  the  conference  by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  said  four  in  ten  business  leaders  were  ""very  confident""  that  their  companies  would  see  sales  rise  in  2005.  Asian  and  American  executives,  however,  were  much  more  confident  than  their  European  counterparts.  But  the  political  discussions,  focusing  on  Iran,  Iraq  and  China,  are  likely  to  dominate  media  attention." 

2	"UKIP's  secret  weapon?  |||    By  any  measure,  New  Yorker  Dick  Morris  is  that  thing  Americans  love  over  everything  else  -  a  winner.  |||    This  is  the  man  who,  some  pundits  believe,  was  almost  single-handedly  responsible  for  Bill  Clinton's  sensational  1992  comeback  victory.  But  Morris  is  no  ideologue.  He  has  worked  as  election  strategist  for  any  number  of  Republicans  as  well  and,  more  recently,  politicians  from  Mexico  to  Uruguay.  Now  he  is  back  in  London  as  the  UK  Independence  Party's  not-so-secret  electoral  weapon  after  returning  from  the  Ukraine  where  he  helped  -  you  guessed  it  -  opposition  candidate  Viktor  Yushchenko.  If  there  is  one  regular  criticism  levelled  at  Morris,  it  is  that  he  is  too  ready  to  switch  allegiances.  That  he  enjoys  the  game  more  than  the  politics.  |||    So  why  Britain  and  why  UKIP  which,  despite  its  recent  EU  election  successes,  is  not  likely  to  pull  off  a  sensational  victory  in  the  looming  general  election.  On  this  subject,  Morris  appears  almost  evangelical.  |||    ""I  was  on  a  cruise  in  the  Mediterranean  and,  coincidentally,  so  was  UKIP  leader  Roger  Knapman.  ""I  had  just  written  a  piece  saying  how  the  English  Channel  was  now  wider  than  the  Atlantic  which  he  liked  and  it  went  from  there"".  But  what  is  it  about  UKIP  that  particularly  attracts  him?  Many  might  think  it  is  simply  another  chance  to  practice  his  art,  irrespective  of  the  politics.  ""I  think  the  greatest  threat  to  democracy  in  the  world  is  not  terrorism  but  bureaucratism"".  A  great  soundbite,  but  a  surprise  coming  from  a  New  Yorker  post  11  September.  ""It  is  the  growth  of  these  bodies  composed  of  experts  who  know  better,  who  don't  believe  in  letting  democracy  govern  but  believe  in  letting  the  correct  solution  be  determined.  ""That's  international  bankers,  the  World  Trade  Organisation,  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  World  Bank  and,  primarily,  the  European  Union"".  |||    So  he  is  out  to  help  UKIP  take  Britain  out  of  this  organisation  which  he  believes  is  unreformable  and  inherently  undemocratic.  And  he  is  scathing  of  the  Tory  party  which  he  also  appears  to  believe  is  unreformable.  ""The  Tory  party  is  schizophrenic  about  Europe.  But  until  somebody  says  they  are  willing  to  leave  the  EU  they  can't  possibly  re-negotiate  anything  (as  Michael  Howard  is  pledged  to  do).  ""It's  like  walking  into  a  liquor  store  with  a  gun  to  rob  it  and  saying:  'before  I  can  proceed  with  the  robbery  I  want  to  make  clear  I  am  not  going  to  shoot  anybody'"".  Possibly  a  very  American  analogy,  but  another  great  soundbite.  ""The  basic  point  is  that  the  EU  seeks  political  integration  to  move  the  entire  nexus  of  decision  making  away  from  Britain  -  and  we  oppose  that  and  the  Tories  cannot  be  trusted  to  oppose  it"".  |||    So  is  UKIP's  job  to  destroy  the  Tories,  as  former  member  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  once  notoriously  declared?  ""No.  The  aim  of  UKIP  is  to  withdraw  from  the  EU  and  if  it  has  any  relation  to  the  Tories  it  is  to  stiffen  the  Tories'  spine  on  the  issue  by  having  a  large  enough  UKIP  vote  so  that  we  move  the  Tories  in  the  direction  they  are  refusing  to  move.  |||    ""But  it's  not  just  to  shift  the  Tories.  I  think  UKIP  had  a  huge  amount  to  do  with  Tony  Blair's  decision  to  hold  a  referendum  on  the  European  constitution  and  I  think  it  had  a  huge  amount  to  do  with  his  refusal  to  go  into  the  euro"".  And,  while  we  are  on  the  subject  of  Mr  Kilroy-Silk,  Mr  Morris  despatches  him  with  another  of  his  neat  soundbites.  ""Robert  Kilroy  Silk  is  not  a  team  player  -  it  is  a  good  idea  our  party  stands  for  some  thing  and  not  some  one"".  |||    So  what  is  the  big  plan  for  the  general  election.  How  will  he  achieve  the  breakthrough?  ""Look,  we  are  not  going  to  be  forming  the  next  government,""  he  said.  Neither  does  UKIP  have  to  fight  every  seat.  As  with  the  2004  US  presidential  election,  he  says,  the  outcome  will  be  decided  by  a  small  number  of  swing  seats  -  just  as  he  believes  it  will  in  Britain.  So,  with  limited  resources,  the  aim  is  to  target  those  seats  and  end  the  day  with  a  significant  group  in  the  Commons.  He  also  believes  it  is  possible  the  internet  could  have  a  big  part  in  the  poll.  ""The  internet  was  a  decisive  factor  in  the  2004  presidential  election  -  through  blogs  (individuals  posting  their  views  in  online  diaries).  People  just  did  it"".  ""Anything  can  happen  in  the  next  general  election.  There  is  an  inherent  instability  at  the  moment.  ""Labour  and  the  Tories  have  drawn  the  consensus  so  tightly  and  to  the  left  there  is  room  for  another  voice"".  |||    That  might,  he  suggests,  lead  to  a  hung  parliament  with  UKIP  and  others  holding  the  balance  of  power.  It  is  a  huge  task,  surely.  But  there  is  undoubtedly  a  sense  that  the  next  general  election  may  indeed  produce  some  surprises  -  even  while  most  still  believe  it  is  Labour's  for  the  taking.  UKIP's  performance  in  last  year's  European  elections  was  just  such  a  shocker  and  showed  that  Mr  Morris  may  have  a  point  about  the  new  consensus.  And  after  all,  he  has  a  reputation  to  sustain." 

2	"Ministers  'naive'  over  phone-taps  |||    The  government  is  being  naive  by  refusing  to  allow  phone-tap  evidence  in  court,  a  senior  EU  politician  says.  |||    Javier  Solana,  EU  foreign  policy  chief,  says  phone-tap  evidence  works  in  the  courts  of  other  European  countries.  Human  rights  groups,  top  police  officers  and  many  MPs  say  allowing  the  evidence  would  remove  the  need  to  detain  terror  suspects  without  charge.  But  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  says  the  evidence  would  not  make  much  difference  to  these  cases.  Mr  Solana  told  ITV1's  Jonathan  Dimbleby  programme:  ""[Phone-tap  evidence  in  court]  works,  it  is  normal  that  it  is  done,  it  would  be  naive  not  to  do  it.  ""It  would  be  naive  not  to  use  this  technological  thing  that  we  have  at  our  disposal.""  Mr  Solana's  comments  come  the  day  after  Sir  Ian  Blair,  the  newly-appointed  Metropolitan  Police  commissioner,  said  he  was  in  favour  of  phone-tap  evidence.  |||    Under  the  Anti-Terrorism  Crimes  and  Security  Act  2001,  foreign  terror  suspects  can  be  detained  in  British  jails  without  trial  or  charge.  Several  suspects  have  been  detained  under  these  powers  because  evidence  against  them  was  deemed  too  sensitive  to  be  heard  in  court.  |||    Some  of  this  evidence  is  believed  to  be  telephone  intercepts.  Human  Rights  group  Liberty  has  argued  that  if  intercept  evidence  could  be  heard,  these  detainees  could  be  brought  to  trial.  But  critics  of  phone-tap  trials  say  the  evidence  is  often  weak  and  can  expose  the  methods  of  the  security  services.  The  home  secretary  says  intercepts  would  not  make  much  difference  because  cases  against  terror  suspects  frequently  rely  on  other  kinds  of  surveillance.  But  Mr  Clarke  has  been  forced  to  change  the  regime  of  detention  without  trial  after  Law  Lords  ruled  it  illegal.  He  has  opted  for  a  system  of  ""control  orders""  whereby  suspects,  both  British  and  foreign,  can  be  held  under  house  arrest  or  surveillance.  These  orders  will  again  involve  a  UK  opt-out  of  parts  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.  While  accepting  that  people  ""have  to  be  prepared""  for  a  possible  terrorist  attack,  Mr  Solana  said  he  had  ""qualms""  about  the  home  secretary's  new  plans.  ""We  have  to  fight  terrorism  with  all  our  means,  but  not  so  far  as  to  change  our  way  of  life,""  he  said."

The  organisation  has  found  itself  in  trouble  after  being  accused  of  helping  to  topple  Georgia's  former  president.

2	"Strike  threat  over  pension  plans  |||    Millions  of  public  service  workers  could  strike  if  ministers  scrap  their  final  salary  pension  scheme  and  make  them  work  longer,  warn  union  leaders.  |||    The  Cabinet  Office  has  confirmed  it  is  reviewing  the  current  pension  system,  prompting  unions  representing  4.5m  workers  to  threaten  united  action.  They  believe  the  plans  include  raising  the  mandatory  retirement  age  for  public  service  workers  from  60  to  65.  The  government  says  unions  will  be  consulted  before  any  changes  are  made.  |||    It  is  thought  the  proposed  overhaul,  due  on  Thursday,  could  mean  pensions  could  be  based  on  a  ""career  average""  salary.  For  each  year  served,  staff  currently  get  one  eightieth  of  their  highest  salary  in  the  final  three  years.  Ministers  will  be  anxious  to  avoid  mass  strike  action  in  the  lead-up  to  the  next  general  election,  which  is  widely  expected  next  May.  In  a  statement  on  Sunday,  the  Cabinet  Office  said  it  was  reviewing  the  Civil  Service  Pension  Scheme,  and  hoped  to  announce  proposals  soon.  ""Unions  will  of  course  be  consulted  about  any  proposed  changes.  ""Public  sector  pension  schemes  need  to  remain  affordable  and  sustainable.  People  are  living  longer  and  pensions  are  getting  more  expensive.  ""To  maintain  the  long-term  affordability  of  our  pension  scheme,  the  government  announced  in  its  Green  Paper  on  pensions  that  pension  age  would  rise  from  60  to  65.""  On  Monday,  Tony  Blair's  official  spokesman  declined  to  say  whether  the  prime  minister  backed  the  plans.  He  said:  ""What's  important  is  that  there's  a  process  going  on,  it's  out  for  consultation  at  the  moment,  let's  wait  for  that  process  to  complete  itself.""  |||    There  is  already  widespread  anger  over  the  chancellor's  plans  to  get  rid  of  more  than  100,000  civil  servants.  Now  public  service  unions  are  united  against  the  plans  and  the  Trades  Union  Congress  is  discussing  the  issue  next  Monday.  Dave  Prentis,  general  secretary  of  Unison,  said  changes  to  pension  provisions  for  workers  in  the  public  sector  would  mean  they  had  to  pay  in  more  but  would  still  face  a  raw  deal.  ""Members  working  in  the  NHS  or  for  local  government  have  never  had  high  pay  or  city  bonuses,  but  they  could  look  forward  to  a  decent  pension  -  now  all  that  is  being  taken  away,""  he  said.  ""What  really  riles  me  is  the  breathtaking  hypocrisy  of  MPs  who  recently  voted  themselves  the  best  pension  scheme  in  Europe,  but  say  they  can't  afford  it  for  anyone  else.  ""This  is  a  position  that  Unison  cannot  accept  and  will  oppose.  It  will  lead  to  conflict  between  Unison  and  the  government,  if  not  this  year  then  next.""  |||    Mr  Prentis  said  workers  did  not  want  to  go  on  strike  and  called  for  talks  between  unions  and  the  highest  level  of  government.  Mark  Serwotka,  from  the  Public  and  Commercial  Services  union  said  there  should  be  a  co-ordinated  one  day  strike  unless  there  was  a  government  rethink.  The  Fire  Brigades  Union  said  the  government  was  planning  to  cut  ill  health  retirement  benefits  for  firefighters  and  other  measures  to  chip  away  at  pensions.  Pensions  officer  Paul  Woolstenholmes  said:  ""The  pensions  of  millions  of  public  sector  workers  are  under  threat  -  apart  from  MPs  and  judges  who  have  the  most  generous  pensions  arrangements  in  the  country.""" 

2	"Tories  reject  rethink  on  axed  MP  |||    Sacked  MP  Howard  Flight's  local  Conservative  association  has  insisted  he  will  not  be  its  candidate  at  the  general  election.  |||    Russell  Tanguay,  agent  for  Arundel  and  South  Downs  Tories,  said  Mr  Flight  was  ineligible  to  be  a  candidate  and  the  association  was  seeking  a  substitute.  The  news  comes  despite  Mr  Flight's  allies  saying  they  had  enough  support  to  hold  a  meeting  to  discuss  his  fate.  Mr  Flight  landed  in  trouble  over  remarks  on  Tory  tax  and  spending  plans.  He  quit  as  Tory  deputy  chairman  after  apparently  suggesting  the  Tories  planned  extra  spending  cuts  -  but  he  wants  to  continue  as  an  MP.  |||    Tory  headquarters  says  he  cannot  stand  as  a  Conservative  candidate  because  he  is  no  longer  an  approved  candidate.  Mr  Tanguay  backed  that  view  on  Tuesday,  saying:  ""Howard  Flight  is  ineligible  to  stand  as  a  Conservative  Party  candidate.  ""The  association  is  in  the  process  of  selecting  a  new  candidate.""  |||    But  the  local  Tory  chairman  made  similar  comments  on  Friday  and  dissent  continues.  Two  local  councillors  who  back  Mr  Flight  met  Mr  Tanguay  and  the  local  association's  chairman  in  Arundel  on  Tuesday  afternoon  but  did  not  comment  as  they  left  the  meeting.  Mr  Flight  says  he  will  not  stand  down  as  a  candidate  unless  his  local  party  instructs  him  to  do  so  at  an  extraordinary  general  meeting  (EGM).  The  MP,  who  is  consulting  his  lawyers,  told  BBC  News:  ""They  selected  me  and  they,  if  you  like,  dispose  of  me  or  keep  me.""  Mr  Flight's  supporters  also  say  they  have  the  50  signatures  needed  to  trigger  the  EGM.  |||    At  a  news  conference,  Mr  Howard  insisted  he  had  played  by  the  party's  rules.  The  Tory  leader,  who  argues  he  is  ensuring  honesty,  said:  ""We  do  not  say  one  thing  in  private  and  another  thing  in  public.""  |||    Labour  election  campaign  coordinator  Alan  Milburn  said  the  Tories  were  in  ""turmoil""  because  Mr  Flight  had  exposed  their  hidden  plans.  The  comments  were  not  a  ""one-off"",  he  said,  claiming  Mr  Howard  and  other  senior  Tories  were  obsessively  committed  to  cutting  public  spending.  Liberal  Democrat  chairman  Matthew  Taylor  said:  ""Whilst  I  disagree  with  Howard  Flight's  views,  it  seems  extraordinary  to  sack  somebody  for  telling  the  truth.""  |||    It  has  also  emerged  Mr  Howard  has  suspended  Slough's  constituency  Conservative  association  for  refusing  to  deselect  its  candidate.  Adrian  Hilton  was  abandoned  after  suggesting  the  signing  of  the  Maastricht  Treaty,  under  John  Major's  government,  was  an  act  of  treason.  The  Catholic  Herald  also  highlighted  articles  he  wrote  about  the  role  of  Catholicism  in  the  European  Union.  Mr  Hilton  was  chosen  to  fight  the  seat  after  the  previous  candidate,  Robert  Oulds,  was  sacked  for  being  pictured  with  a  range  of  guns  and  a  hunting  knife.  Slough  Conservative  Association  has  now  been  placed  on  ""support  status""  and  is  being  run  from  Conservative  campaign  headquarters,  says  a  senior  party  spokesman.  |||    Mr  Hilton  on  Tuesday  said  he  was  considering  taking  legal  action  against  his  deposal.  He  said  the  local  party  had  only  learned  of  the  final  decision  on  the  BBC  News  website  on  Monday  evening.  ""There  are  people  at  Central  Office  who  are  behaving  like  little  dictators  and  seemingly  people  who  are  ordinary  members  are  being  treated  with  contempt,""  he  said.  The  party  says  it  did  try  to  contact  the  local  Conservative  chairman." 

0	"Why  few  targets  are  better  than  many  |||    The  economic  targets  set  out  at  the  Lisbon  summit  of  European  Union  leaders  in  2000  were  meant  to  help  Europe  leapfrog  its  way  past  the  United  States  to  become  the  world's  leading  economy  by  2010.  |||    But  the  Lisbon  targets  are  about  much  more  than  just  economic  prestige.  For  many  economists  and  analysts  they  are  about  ensuring  Europe  doesn't  become  a  global  economic  laggard.  They  are  also  about  ensuring  Europe  can  continue  to  compete  as  an  equal  with  the  growing  economic  giants  of  Asia,  India  and  China,  as  well  as  with  the  economic  might  of  the  United  States.  That's  why  there  was  a  tone  of  urgency  in  the  report,  out  on  Wednesday,  by  the  former  Dutch  prime  minister  Wim  Kok.  Mr  Kok  was  commissioned  by  the  European  Commission  in  March  this  year  to  assess  how  far  the  EU  has  come  towards  meeting  the  Lisbon  targets,  five  years  on  from  their  inception.  His  conclusion  was  simple:  too  many  of  the  targets  will  be  seriously  missed.  |||    Lisbon  risks  becoming  a  ""synonym  for  missed  objectives  and  failed  promises"",  his  report  said.  ""The  status  quo  is  not  an  option.""  |||    At  risk  in  the  medium  to  long  run  is  nothing  less  than  the  sustainability  of  the  society  Europe  has  built,  it  said.  The  report  comes  at  a  time  when  Europe's  competitive  position  is  waning.  The  EU's  economic  growth  rate  is  projected  to  be  2%  this  year  and  2.4%  next.  While  there  has  been  growth  in  overall  employment  rates  in  Europe,  productivity  lags  behind  that  of  the  US.  But  meeting  the  Lisbon  targets  requires  a  political  commitment  that  no  EU  member  state  has  volunteered  so  far.  That  has  in  part  been  due  to  the  state  of  the  global  economy  in  the  past  few  years.  |||    As  Mr  Kok's  report  noted:  ""The  ink  had  scarcely  dried  on  the  [Lisbon]  agreement  before  the  worldwide  stock  market  bubble  imploded.""  ""The  US  suffered  two  years  of  economic  slowdown  and  recession  and  the  European  economy  followed  suit.""  |||    The  circumstances  weren't  conducive  to  creating  the  20  million  new  jobs  promised  by  EU  leaders  in  Lisbon  in  2000.  Neither  were  they  conducive  to  getting  governments  to  spend  more  on  research  and  development,  money  needed  if  the  EU  was  to  meet  its  target  of  becoming  a  so-called  ""knowledge-based  economy"".  ""The  [Lisbon]  vision  is  a  compelling  one,  but  in  order  to  do  it  society  has  to  change,""  said  Paul  Hofheinz  of  the  Lisbon  Council,  a  Brussels-based  citizen  action  group.  ""What  you  find  is  that  a  lot  of  people  have  been  fighting  change.  You  find  trade  unions  fighting  change.  But  also  the  employers'  associations.  ""Even  though  they  tell  you  they're  in  favour  of  change,  many  are  actually  pushing  for  less  competition,  more  subsidy  and  less  free  market  activity.""  |||    But  part  of  the  problem  was  also  linked  to  the  original  targets  set  out  in  Lisbon  five  years  ago.  Targets  have  a  habit  of  coming  back  to  haunt  you  and  in  the  Lisbon  case,  they  covered  too  much,  according  to  the  Wim  report.  Economic  growth  and  job  creation  were  linked  to  issues  ranging  from  environmental  protection  to  social  inclusion,  and  even  safety  at  sea.  The  agenda  was  just  too  broad  and  as  a  result  nothing  was  prioritised.  |||    ""Lisbon  is  about  everything  and  thus  about  nothing,""  the  Kok  report  said.  ""Everybody  is  responsible  and  thus  no  one.""  That's  why  the  Kok  report  recommends  that  the  Lisbon  targets  be  narrowed  down  to  14  key  indicators,  with  an  emphasis  on  creating  jobs  and  economic  growth.  It  also  recommends  that  the  European  Commission  draw  up  a  league  table  which  ranks  countries  according  to  the  steps  they're  taking  towards  meeting  the  targets,  effectively  ""naming,  shaming  and  faming"".  ""Rhetoric  and  delivery  don't  necessarily  go  hand  in  hand,""  Mr  Kok  said  in  a  press  conference  alongside  the  publication  of  his  report.  ""We  don't  have  the  luxury  anymore  just  to  exchange  politeness  with  one  another.""  |||    On  one  point  Mr  Kok  was  very  clear:  The  European  Union  should  not  try  to  emulate  the  US  economy.  The  European  economic  and  social  model  needs  to  change,  but  not  so  much  so  that  social  and  environmental  issues  take  a  backseat  to  economic  growth.  In  that  sense,  the  Lisbon  agenda  is  sailing  into  unchartered  waters.  The  Kok  report  tries  to  do  away  with  a  belief  that  jobs  need  to  be  sacrificed  at  the  altar  of  economic  growth.  ""It's  very  ambitious,""  said  John  Palmer,  political  director  at  the  European  Policy  Centre,  a  Brussels-based  think-tank.  ""This  is  something  that  no  advanced  economy  in  the  world  has  tried  to  do.  It's  going  to  require  quite  new  and  innovative  policies.""  But  some  analysts  believe  that  the  Kok  report  doesn't  come  up  with  the  sort  of  innovative  policies  and  thinking  needed  to  make  the  Lisbon  targets  a  reality.  For  example,  it  recommends  putting  in  place  policies  which  encourage  women  and  older  people  to  remain  in  the  workforce.  But  it  doesn't  say  how  companies  should  be  convinced  to  do  this.  It  will  be  up  to  the  incoming  president  of  the  European  Commission,  Jose  Manuel  Barroso,  to  adopt  Mr  Kok's  recommendations  and  press  them  on  EU  governments.  Mr  Barroso  has  said  that  the  EU's  competitiveness  will  be  his  top  priority.  He  expects  his  five-year  term  in  office  to  be  judged  on  Europe's  success  in  meeting  the  Lisbon  agenda."

Morrison  is  seen  quizzing  a  college  administrator  on  why  he  was  refused.  ""But  what  happened?

The  remaining  $36m  will  be  paid  by  the  directors'  insurers.  But,  a  spokesman  for  the  prosecutor,  New  York  State  Comptroller  Alan  Hevesi,  said  no  formal  agreement  had  been  made.  |||    Corporate  governance  experts  said  that  if  the  directors  do  dip  into  their  own  pockets  for  the  settlement,  it  will  set  a  new  standard  for  the  accountability  of  bosses,  when  the  firms  they  oversee  face  problems.  |||    ""Directors  very  rarely  pay,""  said  Charles  Elson,  chairman  of  the  Center  for  Corporate  Governance  at  the  University  of  Delaware.

Santa  Barbara  County  Superior  Court  is  due  to  consider  the  request  on  Monday.  Mr  Jackson  denies  child  molestation.  It  is  estimated  his  trial  will  cost  Santa  Barbara  county  up  to  $4m  (£2.13m).  |||    Meanwhile  Michael  Jackson's  mother  has  said  she  is  ""100%  certain""  her  son  did  not  commit  the  child  abuse  charges  he  faces.  The  court  is  currently  selecting  12  jurors  and  eight  stand-by  jurors  for  the  trial,  a  process  delayed  until  at  least  Thursday  after  a  member  of  the  star's  legal  team  was  hit  by  family  illness.

The  estimated  total  costs  of  the  trial,  expected  to  last  five  months,  range  from  $2.5m  (£1.33m)  to  $4m  (£2.13m)  of  local  taxpayers'  money.  Those  estimates  do  not  include  costs  to  the  city  of  Santa  Maria,  the  Superior  Court  or  for  the  investigation  and  prosecution  of  the  case.  The  cost  of  security  and  other  needs  around  the  courthouse  has  been  estimated  at  $40,000  (£21,000)  per  day,  said  Jason  Stilwell,  a  special  projects  manager  at  the  county  administrator's  office.  |||    Mr  Jackson,  46,  denies  plying  a  boy  with  alcohol  and  molesting  him.  His  mother  Katherine  Jackson  told  US  TV  network  Fox  News  on  Sunday  that  her  pop  star  son  told  her  he  was  innocent.  ""I  believe  that  for  one  reason  -  I  know  his  character,""  she  said.  ""He  loves  children.  You  don't  molest  anything  that  you  love.""  Describing  Mr  Jackson  as  ""a  good  person"",  the  mother-of-nine  said  she  feared  he  would  not  be  given  a  fair  trial.  ""I  can't  sleep  thinking  about  what  these  wicked  people  might  try  to  do  to  him,""  she  said."

Kate  Winslet  was  also  nominated  in  the  best  actress  category  for  her  role  in  Eternal  Sunshine  of  the  Spotless  Mind.  And  Clive  Owen  and  Sophie  Okonedo  both  got  nominated  for  supporting  roles  in  Closer  and  Hotel  Rwanda  respectively.  Owen  has  already  been  made  bookmakers'  favourite  for  best  supporting  actor  for  the  role  in  Closer  that  has  already  clinched  him  a  Golden  Globe  award.  |||    And  it  is  the  first  nomination  for  actress  Okonedo,  chosen  for  her  performance  in  Hotel  Rwanda,  about  the  1994  Rwandan  genocide.  It  is  also  a  debut  nomination  for  Staunton,  49,  who  told  BBC  News  24  she  had  not  thought  the  film  would  appeal  to  Academy  voters.  ""It  was  an  extraordinary  time  making  the  film  and  I  can't  believe  what  has  happened  this  morning,""  she  said.  ""I  hope  it  just  shows  Mike  up  to  be  the  extraordinary  filmmaker  he  is.  ""We  are  also  dealing  with  a  very  difficult  subject  matter  and  it  is  amazing  to  have  it  accepted  in  this  way.""  Leigh,  who  had  previously  received  three  Oscar  nominations  for  Secrets  and  Lies  and  Topsy  Turvy,  told  BBC  News  24  the  latest  success  was  ""amazing"".  He  said:  ""We  hoped  that  Imelda  Staunton  would  get  a  nomination  but  I  never  expected  to  get  director  and  screenplay.  It's  just  absolutely  wonderful.  |||    ""I  think  people  are  aware  that  it's  about  life  -  and  I  hope  it  is  the  warmth  and  compassion  that  really  talks  to  people.""  Winslet  said  she  was  ""ecstatic""  about  the  fourth  nomination  of  her  career.  ""Being  nominated  means  so  much  to  me.  To  be  nominated  for  a  film  that  was  released  a  while  ago,  I  feel  so  honoured  and  overwhelmed,""  she  said.  John  Woodward,  chief  executive  of  the  UK  Film  Council,  said  it  was  ""extremely  heartening""  to  see  British  filmmaking  talent  recognised  on  the  global  stage.  ""Britain  has  a  hugely  talented  industry  and  these  nominations  show  why  National  Lottery  investment  in  film  pays  major  dividends  for  our  culture  and  economy.""  Among  a  total  of  24  British  nominees,  composer  Andrew  Lloyd  Webber  and  lyricist  Charles  Hart  are  up  for  best  original  song  for  Learn  To  Be  Lonely,  from  The  Phantom  of  the  Opera  movie.  |||    Cinematographer  John  Mathieson,  who  was  nominated  for  Gladiator  in  2001,  is  also  up  for  The  Phantom  of  the  Opera.  And  Finding  Neverland  has  garnered  two  more  nominations  for  Brits.  Gemma  Jackson,  who  has  also  worked  on  Bridget  Jones's  Diary  and  Iris,  is  up  for  art  direction  while  costume  designer  Alexandra  Byrne,  whose  previous  films  have  included  Captain  Corelli's  Mandolin  and  Elizabeth,  is  in  the  running.  The  UK  has  two  contenders  in  the  best  live  action  short  film  category.  Wasp  was  made  by  ex-children's  TV  presenter  Andrea  Arnold  while  Little  Terrorist  is  the  work  of  Ashvin  Kumar.  This  year's  awards  will  be  handed  out  in  Hollywood  on  27  February."

The  Mid-Bedfordshire  MP  had  denied  a  claim  that  he  was  paid  for  guiding  visitors  around  the  Palace  of  Westminster.  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard  has  now  accepted  the  MP's  resignation,  it  has  been  announced.  |||    Mr  Sayeed  was  suspended  from  Parliament  for  two  weeks  last  month  after  the  Commons  standards  and  privileges  committee  said  his  conduct  had  fallen  ""well  below  the  standards  expected"".  The  Conservative  Party  had  already  been  withdrawn  the  whip  for  a  month.  But  his  constituency  association  voted  against  a  move  to  deselect  him,  with  Mr  Sayeed  winning  173  of  the  299  votes.  After  the  vote,  Mr  Sayeed  said  only  a  fifth  of  association  members  had  voted  against  him  and  he  intended  to  get  on  with  winning  the  election.  But  the  vote  prompted  constituency  association  president  Sir  Stanley  Odell  to  resign  in  protest.  The  Standards  and  Privileges  Committee  inquiry  was  launched  after  the  Sunday  Times  alleged  English  Manner  Limited  charged  clients  for  access  to  Westminster  through  Mr  Sayeed.  Mr  Sayeed  had  denied  the  claims,  saying  the  suspension  was  ""unjust  and  wrong""  but  he  made  an  ""unreserved""  apology  to  MPs  in  the  Commons  chamber.  He  insisted  that  the  committee's  report  had  contained  a  ""few  errors  of  fact"".  Mr  Sayeed  has  been  MP  for  Mid-Bedfordshire  since  1997.  He  represented  Bristol  East  from  1983  to  1992."

Swank  triumphed  for  playing  a  gutsy  female  boxer  in  Million  Dollar  Baby.  Modest  wine  country  comedy  Sideways  knocked  out  favourites  Million  Dollar  Baby  and  The  Aviator  by  taking  the  top  prize  for  best  cast  performance.  |||    The  Screen  Actors  Guild  (SAG)  represents  US  film  and  TV  actors.  Its  winners  often  go  on  to  win  Oscars.  In  other  nominations,  Cate  Blanchett  triumphed  as  the  best  supporting  actress  for  her  role  as  Katharine  Hepburn  in  The  Aviator.  Veteran  actor  Morgan  Freeman  took  the  best  supporting  actor  award  for  playing  a  prize-fighter  turned  gym  manager  in  Million  Dollar  Baby.  |||    ""Thank  you  for  Ray  Charles  for  just  living  so  complex  and  so  interesting,  and  making  us  all  just  come  together,""  said  Foxx,  accepting  his  award  in  Los  Angeles  on  Saturday.  |||    He  also  praised  the  film  director:  ""Thank  you  for  Taylor  Hackford  for  taking  a  chance  with  an  African-American  film.  Taylor,  you're  my  director  of  the  year.""  Swank,  too,  was  full  of  praise  for  her  director  and  co-star  Clint  Eastwood.  ""I  bow  down  to  you,""  Swank  said  to  the  74-year-old  Eastwood.  ""You  are  a  talent  beyond  compare.  If  I'm  half  the  person  you  are  and  half  the  talent  you  are  when  I'm  74,  I  will  know  that  I've  accomplished  something  great.""  |||    Both  Foxx  and  Swank  are  now  considered  to  be  among  the  favourites  to  get  Oscars  -  the  Hollywood's  ultimate  prize.  However,  Swank  has  to  overcome  a  strong  challenge  from  Annette  Bening,  a  nominee  for  the  theatre  farce  Being  Julia.  Meanwhile,  ballots  for  Oscars  -  the  Hollywood's  top  honours  -  were  mailed  earlier  this  week  to  members  of  the  Academy  of  Motion  Picture  Arts  and  Sciences.

2	"Hewitt  decries  'career  sexism'  |||    Plans  to  extend  paid  maternity  leave  beyond  six  months  should  be  prominent  in  Labour's  election  manifesto,  the  Trade  and  Industry  Secretary  has  said.  |||    Patricia  Hewitt  said  the  cost  of  the  proposals  was  being  evaluated,  but  it  was  an  ""increasingly  high  priority""  and  a  ""shared  goal  across  government"".  Ms  Hewitt  was  speaking  at  a  gender  and  productivity  seminar  organised  by  the  Equal  Opportunities  Commission  (EOC).  Mothers  can  currently  take  up  to  six  months'  paid  leave  -  and  six  unpaid.  Ms  Hewitt  told  the  seminar:  ""Clearly,  one  of  the  things  we  need  to  do  in  the  future  is  to  extend  the  period  of  payment  for  maternity  leave  beyond  the  first  six  months  into  the  second  six  months.  ""We  are  looking  at  how  quickly  we  can  do  that,  because  obviously  there  are  cost  implications  because  the  taxpayer  reimburses  the  employers  for  the  cost  of  that.""  |||    Ms  Hewitt  also  announced  a  new  drive  to  help  women  who  want  to  work  in  male  dominated  sectors,  saying  sexism  at  work  was  still  preventing  women  reaching  their  full  potential.  Plans  include  funding  for  universities  to  help  female  science  and  engineering  graduates  find  jobs  and  ""taster  courses""  for  men  and  women  in  non-traditional  jobs.  Women  in  full-time  work  earn  19%  less  than  men,  according  to  the  Equal  Opportunities  Commission  (EOC).  |||    The  minister  told  delegates  that  getting  rid  of  ""career  sexism""  was  vital  to  closing  the  gender  pay  gap.  |||    ""Career  sexism  limits  opportunities  for  women  of  all  ages  and  prevents  them  from  achieving  their  full  potential.  ""It  is  simply  wrong  to  assume  someone  cannot  do  a  job  on  the  grounds  of  their  sex,""  she  said.  Earlier,  she  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""What  we  are  talking  about  here  is  the  fact  that  about  six  out  of  20  women  work  in  jobs  that  are  low-paid  and  typically  dominated  by  women,  so  we  have  got  very  segregated  employment.  ""Unfortunately,  in  some  cases,  this  reflects  very  old-fashioned  and  stereotypical  ideas  about  the  appropriate  jobs  for  women,  or  indeed  for  men.  ""Career  sexism  is  about  saying  that  engineering,  for  instance,  where  only  10%  of  employees  are  women,  is  really  a  male-dominated  industry.  Construction  is  even  worse.  ""But  it  is  also  about  saying  childcare  jobs  are  really  there  for  women  and  not  suitable  for  men.  Career  sexism  goes  both  ways.""  |||    She  added  that  while  progress  had  been  made,  there  was  still  a  gap  in  pay  figures.  ""The  average  woman  working  full-time  is  being  paid  about  80p  for  every  pound  a  man  is  earning.  For  women  working  part-time  it  is  60p.""  The  Department  for  Trade  and  Industry  will  also  provide  funding  to  help  a  new  pay  experts  panel  run  by  the  TUC.  |||    It  has  been  set  up  to  advise  hundreds  of  companies  on  equal  wage  policies.  Research  conducted  by  the  EOC  last  year  revealed  that  many  Britons  believe  the  pay  gap  between  men  and  women  is  the  result  of  ""natural  differences""  between  the  sexes.  Women  hold  less  than  10%  of  the  top  positions  in  FTSE  100  companies,  the  police,  the  judiciary  and  trade  unions,  according  to  their  figures.  And  retired  women  have  just  over  half  the  income  of  their  male  counterparts  on  average."

Another  1,700  will  go  from  its  sales  department,  3,400  from  business  operations  and  2,600  across  legal,  advertising  and  public  relations.  SBC  currently  employs  163,000  people  while  AT&T  employs  47,000.  The  takeover  was  announced  on  Monday.  The  deal  will  be  financed  with  $15bn  of  shares  as  well  as  a  $1bn  special  dividend  paid  to  AT&T  shareholders.  |||    It  effectively  marks  the  end  of  AT&T,  which  was  founded  in  1875  by  telephone  pioneer  Alexander  Graham  Bell  and  is  one  of  the  US's  best-known  companies.  SBC  and  AT&T  said  estimated  cost  savings  of  at  least  $2bn  from  2008  were  a  main  driver  for  the  merger.  AT&T  is  a  long-distance  telecoms  firm,  while  SBC  is  mainly  focused  on  the  local  market  in  the  western  US.  Both  also  have  data  network  businesses.  The  takeover  is  subject  to  approval  by  AT&T's  shareholders  and  regulators.  The  companies  said  they  expected  to  complete  the  agreement  during  the  first  half  of  2006."

The  full  economic  costs  of  the  disaster  remain  unclear.  In  part,  this  is  because  of  its  scale,  and  because  delivering  aid  and  recovering  the  dead  remain  priorities.  But  Indonesian,  Indian  and  Hong  Kong  stock  markets  reached  record  highs  on  Wednesday,  suggesting  that  investors  do  not  fear  a  major  economic  impact.  |||    The  highs  showed  the  gap  in  outlook  between  investors  in  large  firms  and  individuals  who  have  lost  their  livelihoods.  |||    Investors  seemed  to  feel  that  some  of  the  worst-affected  areas  -  such  as  Aceh  in  Indonesia  -  were  so  under-developed  that  the  tragedy  would  little  impact  on  Asia's  listed  companies,  according  to  analysts.  ""Obviously  with  a  lot  of  loss  of  life,  a  lot  of  time  is  needed  to  clean  up  the  mess,  bury  the  people  and  find  the  missing.  But  it's  not  necessarily  a  really  big  thing  in  the  economic  sense,""  said  ABN  Amro  chief  Asian  strategist  Eddie  Wong.  India's  Bombay  Stock  Exchange  inched  slightly  above  its  previous  record  close  on  Wednesday.  Expectations  of  strong  corporate  earnings  in  2005  drove  the  Indonesian  stock  exchange  in  Jakarta  to  a  record  high  on  Wednesday.  In  Hong  Kong,  the  Hang  Seng  index  may  be  benefiting  in  part  from  the  potential  for  its  listed  property  companies  to  gain  from  rebuilding  contracts  in  the  tsunami-affected  regions  of  South  East  Asia.  In  Sri  Lanka,  some  economists  have  said  that  as  much  as  1%  of  annual  growth  may  be  lost.  Sri  Lanka's  stock  market  has  fallen  about  5%  since  the  weekend,  but  it  is  still  40%  higher  than  at  the  start  of  2004.  |||    Thailand  may  lose  30bn  baht  (£398m;  $768m)  in  earnings  from  tourism  over  the  next  three  months,  according  to  tourism  minister  Sontaya  Kunplome.  |||    In  the  affected  provinces,  he  expects  the  loss  of  tourism  revenue  to  be  offset  by  government  reconstruction  spending.  Thailand  intends  to  spend  a  similar  sum  -  around  30bn  baht  -  on  the  rebuilding  work.  ""It  will  take  until  the  fourth  quarter  of  next  year  before  tourist  visitors  in  Phuket  and  five  other  provinces  return  to  their  normal  level,""  said  Naris  Chaiyasoot,  director  general  at  the  ministry's  fiscal  policy  office.  In  the  Maldives  the  cost  of  reconstruction  could  wipe  out  economic  growth,  according  to  a  government  spokesman.  ""Our  nation  is  in  peril  here,""  said  Ahmed  Shaheed,  the  chief  government  spokesman.  He  estimated  the  economic  cost  of  the  disaster  at  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.  The  Maldives  has  gross  domestic  product  of  $660m.  ""It  won't  be  surprising  if  the  cost  exceeds  our  GDP,""  he  said.  ""In  the  last  few  years,  we  made  great  progress  in  our  standard  of  living  -  the  United  Nations  recognised  this.  Now  we  see  this  can  disappear  in  a  few  days,  a  few  minutes.""  Shaheed  noted  that  investment  in  a  single  tourist  resort  -  the  economic  mainstay  -  could  run  to  $40m.  Between  10  and  12  of  the  80-odd  resorts  have  been  severely  damaged,  and  a  similar  number  have  suffered  significant  damage.  However,  many  experts,  including  the  World  Bank,  have  pointed  out  that  it  is  still  difficult  to  assess  the  magnitude  of  the  disaster  and  its  likely  economic  impact."

Also  capitalising  on  Brits  success  were  the  Scissor  Sisters  whose  eponymous  album  moved  three  places  to  number  two.  U2's  latest  single  Sometimes  You  Can't  Make  It  On  Your  Own  took  the  top  spot  in  the  singles  chart,  ahead  of  Elvis.

2	"UK  rebate  'unjustified'  -  Chirac  |||    French  president  Jacques  Chirac  has  called  the  UK's  £3bn  rebate  from  the  European  Union  ""unjustified"".  |||    Speaking  after  a  summit  meeting  he  said  unless  it  was  put  up  for  discussion  the  EU  would  never  be  able  to  reach  agreement  on  its  medium  term  finances.  Earlier  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  said  the  UK  was  prepared  to  veto  any  bid  to  reduce  the  rebate  secured  by  Margaret  Thatcher  in  1984.  He  said  it  remained  justified  because  less  EU  farm  money  came  to  the  UK.  |||    Mr  Chirac  told  reporters  in  Brussels:  ""One  can  only  have  a  reasonable  budgetary  balance  if  we  put  back  on  the  table  the  British  cheque.  It  can  no  longer  be  justified.  It  was  from  the  past.""  But  a  UK  Government  official  responded:  ""Even  with  the  rebate,  the  UK  pays  two  and  a  half  times  more  than  France  contributes  to  the  EU  budget.  Without  it  we  would  pay  14  times  as  much  as  France.  ""There  can  be  no  deal  on  future  financing  which  does  not  protect  the  rebate.""  |||    The  25-member  EU  is  gearing  up  for  tough  negotiations  on  its  budget  plans  for  the  period  2007-2013,  with  the  bloc's  Luxembourg  presidency  hoping  to  strike  a  deal  at  a  June  summit.  Earlier  Conservative  Graham  Brady  said  the  rebate  was  a  ""crucial  test""  of  how  firmly  ministers  were  prepared  to  stand  up  for  Britain.  EU  Commission  president  Jose  Manuel  Barroso  has  indicated  he  wants  the  rebate  to  come  to  an  end.  Mr  Straw  said  that  as  well  as  the  veto  over  the  rebate  the  UK  wanted  to  keep  a  tight  rein  on  national  contributions.  |||    The  UK,  France,  Germany,  Austria,  the  Netherlands  and  Sweden  want  the  EU  budget  to  be  capped  at  1%  of  member  states'  combined  national  incomes  -  the  European  Commission  has  urged  an  increase  to  1.26%.  Mr  Straw  has  said  the  EU  commission's  proposal  would  mean  a  35%  hike  in  the  budget.  Shadow  Europe  minister  Mr  Brady  said:  ""I  believe  it  is  essential  that  Britain  keeps  the  rebate  and  I  think  it's  a  crucial  test  of  how  firmly  the  British  government  is  prepared  to  stand  up  for  Britain  internationally  in  Europe.  |||    ""The  UK  is  already  one  of  the  biggest  net  contributors  to  the  EU  .""  The  foreign  secretary  meanwhile  said  the  ""justice""  of  the  rebate  remained.  ""We  have  one  of  the  lowest  net  receipts  of  any  EU  country  because  of  the  relatively  small  size  of  our  agriculture  sector  and  its  efficiency.  ""That  continues  to  be  the  case.""  |||    UK  Independence  Party  leader  Roger  Knapman  said  the  rebate  was  ""set  in  stone""  and  there  was  no  reason  to  negotiate  about  it.  ""It  is  extraordinary  to  do  it  at  this  time,  just  as  we  are  becoming  the  biggest  contributor  to  the  EU.  If  we  lose  our  rebate  as  well,  the  British  taxpayer  is  going  to  be  bled  at  such  a  rate  that  I  think  everyone  will  go  off  the  European  project.""  EU  leaders  are  holding  talks  in  Brussels  on  how  to  re-energise  the  sluggish  European  economy.  UK  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  is  meeting  his  EU  counterparts  to  finalise  a  package  of  measures  aimed  at  stimulating  growth  and  boosting  employment  ahead  of  a  series  of  referendums  on  the  European  Constitution.  The  plans  could  introduce  a  free  market  into  everything  from  computer  services  to  construction.  Critics  -  including  Germany  and  France  -  believe  liberalisation  could  result  in  companies  shifting  staff  to  cheaper  bases  in  Eastern  Europe,  undercutting  large  EU  economies  and  undermining  social  protections.  There  are  also  concerns  about  the  number  of  workers  from  eastern  European  countries  who  will  head  west,  exacerbating  the  already  high  unemployment  levels  in  Germany.  |||    Mr  Straw  insisted  there  was  nothing  to  fear  from  the  services  directorate.  ""European  countries  overall  have  benefited  hugely  from  the  free  market  in  goods,""  he  said.  ""What  we  are  now  talking  about  is  developing  that  market  into  an  internal  market  in  services.""  Britain's  low  unemployment  meant  there  was  less  ""neurosis""  about  people  coming  from  eastern  European  countries.  ""In  countries  like  Germany  and  France,  where  frankly  because  of  a  tighter  social  market  they  have  much  higher  levels  of  unemployment,  there  is  increasing  anxiety  about  other  people  coming  in,""  he  said." 

3	"Italy  aim  to  rattle  England  |||    Italy  coach  John  Kirwan  believes  his  side  can  upset  England  as  the  Six  Nations  wooden  spoon  battle  hots  up.  |||    The  two  sides,  both  without  a  win,  meet  on  12  March  at  Twickenham  and  Kirwan  says  his  side  will  be  hoping  to  make  the  most  of  England's  current  slump.  ""We  have  to  make  sure  the  England  and  France  games  are  tough  for  them.  ""England  have  not  been  having  the  best  of  championships.  That  is  a  big  one  for  us  and  them  and  I  am  sure  my  players  will  rise  to  the  occasion,""  he  said.  But  Kirwan  admits  that  a  lot  of  hard  work  will  be  needed  with  his  kickers  before  the  trip  to  London.  Roland  de  Marigny  and  Luciano  Orquera  had  a  miserable  time  with  the  boot  in  the  dire  defeat  to  Scotland  as  Chris  Paterson  stole  the  show  to  give  the  hosts  a  much-needed  18-10  victory.  Kirwan  said:  ""The  kicking  was  the  decisive  factor  in  Scotland  which  cost  us  and  it  could  go  down  to  the  kicking  again  next  time.  ""But  I  have  a  lot  of  confidence  in  my  players  and  I  am  positive  we  can  put  everything  together  against  England.""  England,  meanwhile,  are  licking  their  wounds  and  rueing  what  might  have  been  had  two  decisions  from  referee  Jonathan  Kaplan  not  gone  against  them  in  the  second  half  in  Dublin.  First  Mark  Cueto  was  judged  offside  as  he  chased  fly-half  Charlie  Hodgson's  kick,  and  then  Kaplan  opted  not  to  call  upon  video  evidence  to  see  if  Josh  Lewsey  had  touched  down  after  being  driven  over  Ireland's  line.  |||    But  centre  Jamie  Noon  believes  the  side  at  least  showed  better  form  than  their  previous  two  defeats.  ""We  definitely  improved  against  an  in-form  Irish  side,""  he  said.  ""We  went  to  Dublin  quietly  confident  that  we  would  be  able  to  compete,  and  I  think  we  showed  that.  ""We  have  got  to  make  sure  we  now  take  the  form  and  positives  into  the  Italy  game.  We  are  under  no  illusions  that  it  is  going  to  be  easy,  but  we  definitely  need  a  win.""  England  have  now  equalled  an  18-year  low  of  four  successive  championship  defeats,  including  France  in  Paris  last  season,  and  have  lost  four  in  a  row  under  Andy  Robinson.  His  predecessor,  Sir  Clive  Woodward,  began  his  seven-year  reign  with  three  defeats  and  two  draws."

He  said  not  holding  the  awards  would  be  counter  to  the  work  the  magazine  has  done  to  promote  hip  hop  music.  Rapper  Young  Buck  has  been  charged  after  allegedly  stabbing  a  man  who  hit  Dr  Dre  as  he  was  about  to  receive  a  lifetime  achievement  award.  |||    The  rapper,  whose  real  name  is  David  Darnell  Brown,  is  due  in  court  on  20  December  after  being  arrested  on  one  charge  of  attempted  murder  and  a  second  charge  of  assault  with  a  deadly  weapon.  The  performer  is  one  of  the  members  of  50  Cent's  G-Unit  group,  which  is  signed  to  Dr  Dre's  record  label.  The  man  who  was  stabbed,  Jimmy  James  Johnson,  suffered  a  collapsed  lung  and  is  in  a  stable  condition  at  a  Los  Angeles  hospital.  Mr  Johnson  allegedly  approached  Dr  Dre,  who  was  seated  at  a  table  in  front  of  the  stage,  and  appeared  to  ask  for  an  autograph  before  punching  him.  During  the  ensuing  scuffle  -  which  involved  many  of  the  1,000-strong  crowd  -  Mr  Johnson  was  stabbed  as  he  was  being  dragged  away  by  security  staff," 

2	"UK  pledges  £1bn  to  vaccine  effort  |||    UK  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  has  offered  £960m  ($1.8bn)  over  15  years  to  an  international  scheme  aiming  to  boost  vaccination  and  immunisation  schemes.  |||    In  a  speech,  he  called  for  action  to  reach  the  2000  Millennium  Declaration  goals  of  halving  global  poverty  and  tackling  child  mortality  rates.  Mr  Brown  has  just  returned  from  a  tour  of  African  nations.  The  £1bn  commitment  is  part  of  a  five-point  plan  on  debt  relief,  trade,  aid,  education  and  health.  |||    The  chancellor  was  speaking  at  an  event  jointly  organised  by  the  UK's  Department  for  International  Development  and  the  UN  Development  Programme  on  Wednesday.  Mr  Brown  welcomed  news  that  the  Bill  Gates  Foundation  and  Norway  are  joining  up  to  put  an  extra  £0.53bn  ($1bn  )  into  the  Global  Alliance  for  Vaccines  and  Immunisation  (Gavi).  Britain,  France,  Gavi  and  the  Gates  Foundation  have  drawn  up  proposals  to  apply  the  principles  of  the  International  Finance  Facility  (IFF)  to  the  area  of  immunisation.  That  could  see  donors  making  long-term,  legally  binding  financial  commitments  which  can  then  be  used  as  collateral  for  raising  extra  funds  from  international  capital  markets.  As  well  as  pledging  £960m  over  15  years  to  the  immunisation  IFF,  Britain  urged  other  donors  to  contribute.  |||    If  Gavi  could  increase  its  funding  for  immunisation  by  an  extra  £4bn  ($7.4bn)  over  10  years,  then  an  extra  five  million  lives  could  have  been  saved  by  2015  and  five  million  thereafter,  Mr  Brown  argued.  Campaign  groups  including  Friends  of  the  Earth,  the  World  Development  Movement,  and  War  on  Want  said  UK  government  policy  on  free  trade  was  a  major  barrier  to  fighting  poverty.  War  on  Want's  John  Hilary  said:  ""Compassionate  rhetoric  cannot  disguise  the  reality  of  the  government's  neo-liberal  policies.  ""As  long  as  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  continue  to  push  free  trade  and  privatisation  on  developing  countries,  more  and  more  people  will  be  pushed  deeper  into  poverty,  not  lifted  out  of  it."""

However  they  said  that  Busted  would  ""reconvene  in  due  course"".  The  band  have  had  eight  top  three  hits,  including  four  number  ones,  since  they  first  hit  the  charts  in  2002.  Their  singles  include  What  I  Go  To  School  For,  Year  3000,  Crashed  The  Wedding,  You  Said  No,  and  Who's  David?  |||    The  band,  which  also  includes  members  Matt  Jay  and  James  Bourne,  made  the  top  ten  with  their  self-titled  debut  album,  as  well  as  the  follow-up,  A  Present  For  Everyone,  in  2003.  They  won  best  pop  act  and  best  breakthrough  act  at  the  2004  Brit  Awards  and  were  nominated  for  best  British  group.  Most  recently  they  topped  the  charts  with  the  theme  from  the  live-action  film  version  of  Thunderbirds,  which  was  voted  Record  Of  The  Year  on  the  ITV1  show.  The  band  have  capitalised  on  a  craze  for  artists  playing  catchy  pop  music  with  rock  overtones.  The  trio  are  seen  as  an  alternative  to  more  manufactured  artists  who  are  not  considered  credible  musicians  because  they  do  not  write  their  own  songs  or  play  their  own  instruments.  However,  recent  rumours  have  suggested  that  Simpson  has  been  wanting  to  quit  the  band  to  focus  on  Fightstar.  He  now  plans  to  take  Fightstar  on  tour."

He  plans  to  stand  in  the  next  general  election  but  refused  to  confirm  he  is  setting  up  a  new  political  party  called  Veritas  -  Latin  for  truth.  UKIP  leader  Roger  Knapman  said  he  would  ""break  open  the  champagne"",  adding:  ""It  was  nice  knowing  him,  now  'goodbye'.""  However,  he  did  say  the  ex-chat  show  host  had  been  ""quite  useful  initially"".  ""He  has  remarkable  ability  to  influence  people  but,  sadly,  after  the  (European)  election  it  became  clear  that  he  was  more  interested  in  the  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  Party  than  the  UK  Independence  Party  so  it  was  nice  knowing  him,  now  'goodbye',""  Mr  Knapman  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  Mr  Knapman  rejected  the  idea  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  posed  a  threat  to  UKIP  and  queried  why  he  had  failed  to  confirm  rumours  he  was  starting  a  new  political  party.  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk  explained  his  reasons  to  his  East  Midlands  constituents  at  a  meeting  in  Hinckley,  Leicestershire.  His  decision  came  as  UKIP  officials  began  a  process  which  could  have  triggered  Mr  Kilroy-Silk's  expulsion.  It  marks  the  end  of  his  membership  of  UKIP  after  just  nine  months.  It  began  with  a  flood  of  publicity  which  helped  UKIP  into  third  place  in  last  June's  European  elections  but  became  dominated  by  rancour  as  he  tried  to  take  over  the  party  leadership.  |||    Mr  Kilroy-Silk  accused  his  fellow  UKIP  MEPs  of  being  content  with  growing  fat  ""sitting  on  their  backsides""  in  Brussels.  He  told  BBC  News  24:  ""I  tried  to  change  the  party,  I  nagged  all  the  way  through  the  summer  to  do  things,  to  get  moving  because  I  thought  it  was  criminal  what  they  were  doing,  it  was  a  betrayal.""  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  also  told  Sky  News  there  was  ""masses  of  support""  for  him  to  form  a  new  party  -  something  he  has  yet  to  confirm  will  happen.  |||    UKIP  won  12  seats  and  16.1%  of  the  vote  at  the  European  elections  on  the  back  of  its  call  for  the  UK  to  leave  the  European  Union  In  his  speech,  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  says  the  result  offered  UKIP  an  ""amazing  opportunity""  but  the  party's  leadership  had  done  nothing  and  ""gone  AWOL"".  There  were  no  policies,  no  energy,  no  vision  and  no  spokespeople,  he  said.  ""The  party  is  going  nowhere  and  I'm  embarrassed  with  its  allies  in  Europe  and  I'm  ashamed  to  be  a  member  of  the  party,""  said  Mr  Kilroy-Silk.  |||    He  said  his  conviction  in  Britain's  right  to  govern  itself  had  not  changed.  He  would  continue  that  campaign  outside  UKIP  when  he  contested  the  general  election  in  an  East  Midlands  constituency.  Reports  of  his  new  party  plans  have  prompted  a  formal  complaint  to  UKIP's  disciplinary  committee  for  bringing  the  party  into  ""disrepute"".  On  Thursday,  the  party  challenged  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  to  stand  down  as  an  MEP  so  voters  can  get  a  genuine  UKIP  candidate."

The  original  film,  released  in  1980,  has  spawned  ten  sequels  based  around  mask-wearing  murderer  Jason  Voorhees.  The  most  recent,  Freddy  Vs  Jason,  was  released  in  summer  2003.  That  film  saw  Jason  battle  Freddy  Krueger,  star  of  the  Nightmare  on  Elm  Street  franchise.  According  to  the  industry  newspaper,  New  Line  had  been  trying  to  make  another  sequel  involving  Ash,  the  hero  of  the  Evil  Dead  movies,  but  was  unable  to  agree  terms  with  director  Sam  Raimi.  Tarantino  is  said  to  be  intrigued  by  the  prospect  of  building  a  new  film  around  one  of  the  horror  genre's  most  recognised  figures.  First,  however,  he  is  scheduled  to  direct  the  season  finale  of  US  television  series  CSI:  Crime  Scene  Investigation.  Filming  is  due  to  start  in  early  April.  Tarantino's  episode,  for  which  he  also  wrote  the  original  story,  will  be  broadcast  in  the  US  on  19  May."

Julie  Andrews  starred  in  the  1965  film  version  of  the  Rogers  and  Hammerstein  classic  set  in  the  Alpine  country.  But  despite  being  one  of  the  most  successful  musicals  of  all  time,  it  is  barely  known  inside  Austria.  |||    The  film  was  never  shown  in  any  cinema  in  Austria  and  was  not  broadcast  on  television  until  the  early  1990s.  The  musical  is  based  on  the  true  story  of  the  von  Trapp  family  who  formed  a  singing  troupe  and  escaped  from  Nazi-occupied  Austria  in  1938.  |||    Sensitivities  about  Nazism  during  wartime  Austria  and  issues  towards  the  von  Trapp  family  themselves  could  explain  Austria's  reluctance  to  embrace  the  musical.  Another  source  of  irritation  for  Austrians  is  the  song  Edelweiss,  which  is  considered  an  traditional  folk  song  by  many  filmgoers.  The  song  was  actually  an  invention  by  Rodgers  and  Hammerstein.  Many  also  consider  the  film  to  portray  a  kitsch  image  of  Austria,  including  yodelling,  goat-herds  and  lederhosen.  The  production  is  being  staged  at  a  Viennese  opera  house,  the  Volksoper,  beginning  on  Saturday.  Maria,  the  novice  nun  who  falls  in  love  with  Baron  von  Trapp,  will  be  played  by  Austro-Australian  actress  and  singer  Sandra  Pires."

But  fans  around  the  world  have  pitched  in  to  pay  for  the  advert,  which  had  the  headline  ""Save  Star  Trek"".  They  are  also  asking  the  Sci-Fi  Channel  to  pick  it  up  from  UPN  and  will  stage  a  rally  in  Los  Angeles  on  25  February.  |||    The  advert  described  the  Star  Trek  franchise  as  a  ""cultural  icon"".  Enterprise  stars  former  Quantum  Leap  actor  Scott  Bakula  as  Captain  Archer  and  is  set  before  the  original  1960s  Star  Trek  series.  ""Captain  Archer  and  the  crew  of  the  NX-01  need  your  help  to  continue  their  journeys!""  the  advert  said.  It  also  included  a  cut-out  coupon  for  fans  to  send  to  UPN's  parent  companies  Paramount  and  Viacom  plus  the  Sci-Fi  Channel.  It  also  urged  supporters  to  join  the  rally  outside  the  Paramount  studios.  |||    Fan  website  Trek  United  is  hoping  to  raise  $32m  (£17m)  from  donations  by  the  end  of  March  to  pay  for  a  fifth  series.  More  than  $23,000  (£12,000)  has  been  pledged  so  far,  according  to  the  site.  The  98th  and  final  episode  of  Star  Trek:  Enterprise  will  air  in  the  US  on  13  May.  The  fourth  series  has  averaged  2.9  million  viewers  per  episode  -  half  the  amount  it  got  in  its  first  series.

And  its  owner,  P&O  Cruises  -  now  part  of  the  huge  US  Carnival  Corporation  -  was  looking  at  a  significant  slice  chopped  off  this  year's  profits  and  a  potential  PR  fiasco.  No-one,  however,  seems  to  have  told  the  stock  markets.  The  warning  of  a  five-cent  hit  to  2005  earnings  came  just  24  hours  after  one  of  the  world's  biggest  investment  banks  had  upped  its  target  for  Carnival's  share  price,  from  £35  to  £36.20.  Other  investors  barely  blinked,  and  by  1300  GMT  Carnival's  shares  in  London  were  down  a  single  penny,  or  0.03%,  at  £32.26.  |||    Why  the  mismatch  between  the  public  perception  and  the  market's  response?  ""The  Aurora  issue  had  been  an  ongoing  one  for  some  time,""  says  Deutsche  Bank's  Simon  Champion.  ""It  was  clearly  a  source  of  uncertainty  for  the  company  -  it  was  a  long  cruise,  after  all.  But  the  stock  market  is  very  good  at  treating  these  issues  as  one-off  events.""  |||    Despite  its  string  of  bad  luck,  he  pointed  out,  Aurora  is  just  one  vessel  in  a  large  Carnival  fleet,  the  UK's  P&O  Princess  group  having  been  merged  into  the  much  larger  US  firm  in  2003.  And  generally  speaking,  Carnival  has  a  reputation  for  keeping  its  ships  pretty  much  on  schedule.  ""Carnival  has  an  incredibly  strong  track  record,""  Mr  Champion.  |||    Similarly,  analysts  expect  the  impact  on  the  rest  of  the  cruise  business  to  be  limited.  The  hundreds  of  disappointed  passengers  who  have  now  had  to  give  up  the  opportunity  to  spend  the  next  three  months  on  the  Aurora  have  got  both  a  refund  and  a  credit  for  another  cruise.  That  should  mitigate  some  of  the  PR  risk,  both  for  Carnival  and  its  main  competitor,  Royal  Caribbean.  ""While  not  common,  cancellations  for  technical  reasons  are  not  entirely  unusual  in  the  industry,""  wrote  analysts  from  Citigroup  Smith  Barney  in  a  note  to  clients  on  Friday.  ""Moreover,  such  events  typically  have  a  limited  impact  on  bookings  and  pricing  for  future  cruises.""  After  all,  the  Aurora  incident  may  be  big  news  in  the  UK  -  but  for  Carnival  customers  elsewhere  it's  unlikely  to  make  too  much  of  a  splash.  |||    Assuming  that  Citigroup  is  right,  and  demand  stays  solid,  the  structure  of  the  industry  also  works  in  Carnival's  favour.  In  the  wake  of  P&O  Princess's  takeover  by  Carnival,  the  business  is  now  to  a  great  extent  a  duopoly.  Given  the  expense  of  building,  outfitting  and  running  a  cruise  ship,  ""slowing  supply  growth""  is  a  certainty,  said  David  Anders  at  Merrill  Lynch  on  Thursday.  In  other  words,  if  you  do  want  a  cruise,  your  options  are  limited.  And  with  Carnival  remaining  the  market  leader,  it  looks  set  to  keep  selling  the  tickets  -  no  matter  what  happens  to  the  ill-fated  Aurora  in  the  future." 

0	"Warning  over  US  pensions  deficit  |||    Taxpayers  may  have  to  bail  out  the  US  agency  that  protects  workers'  pension  funds,  leading  economists  have  warned.  |||    With  the  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation  (PBGC)  some  £23bn  (£12m)  in  deficit,  the  Financial  Economists  Roundtable  (FER)  wants  Congress  to  act.  Instead  of  taxpayers  having  to  pick  up  the  bill,  the  FER  wants  Congressmen  to  change  the  PBGC's  funding  rules.  The  FER  says  firms  should  not  have  been  allowed  to  reduce  the  insurance  premiums  they  pay  into  the  PBGC  fund.  The  FER  blames  this  on  a  2004  law,  in  a  statement  signed  by  several  members,  who  include  Nobel  economics  laureate  William  Sharpe.  It  said  it  was  ""dismayed""  at  the  situation  and  wants  Congress  to  overturn  the  legislation.  |||    Cash-strapped  US  companies,  including  those  in  the  airline,  car-making  and  steel  industries,  had  argued  in  favour  of  the  2004  rule  change,  claiming  that  funding  the  insurance  premiums  adequately  would  force  them  to  have  to  cut  jobs.  ""With  a  little  firmer  hand  on  the  pensions  issues  in  the  US,  I  think  that  Congress  could  avoid  having  to  turn  to  the  taxpayer  and  instead  turn  the  obligations  back  onto  the  companies  that  deserve  to  pay  them,""  said  Professor  Dennis  Logue,  dean  of  Price  College  of  Business  at  the  University  of  Oklahoma.  The  PBGC  was  founded  in  1974  to  protect  workers'  retirement  rights.  Its  most  recent  action  came  last  week  when  it  took  control  of  the  pilots'  pension  scheme  at  United  Airlines.

He  won  a  Grammy  in  1998  and  is  nominated  for  two  more  this  year.  The  13  February  ceremony  will  also  include  a  rendition  of  The  Beatles'  Across  The  Universe  by  Bono,  Stevie  Wonder,  Norah  Jones  and  Brian  Wilson.  The  song  will  go  on  sale  online  to  raise  money  for  the  tsunami  aid  effort.  The  awards  show  will  also  feature  performances  from  U2,  Green  Day,  Alicia  Keys  and  Kanye  West  -  but  the  Lopez  and  Anthony  duet  is  likely  to  be  one  of  the  biggest  talking  points.  |||    Anthony,  born  in  New  York  to  a  Puerto  Rican  family,  is  reported  to  be  the  biggest-selling  salsa  artist  of  all  time.  He  is  nominated  this  year  for  best  Latin  pop  album  and  best  salsa/merengue  album.  The  tsunami  tribute  song  will  also  feature  Alicia  Keys,  Velvet  Revolver  and  Tim  McGraw.  Fans  will  be  able  to  download  it  for  $0.99  (£0.53)  from  iTunes,  or  purchase  the  video  from  the  CBS  TV  network's  site.  Kanye  West,  the  rapper  who  leads  the  awards  with  10  nominations,  will  perform  alongside  John  Legend,  Mavis  Staples  and  the  Blind  Boys  of  Alabama.  There  will  also  be  a  tribute  to  Ray  Charles  featuring  Bonnie  Raitt  and  Billy  Preston  and  a  celebration  of  southern  rock  with  Tim  McGraw,  Gretchen  Wilson,  Lynyrd  Skynyrd,  Dickie  Betts  and  Elvis  Bishop.  Ray  Charles,  who  died  in  June  2004,  has  seven  posthumous  nominations.  Alicia  Keys  and  Usher  share  eight  nominations  each."

That  charge  was  denied  by  Mr  Mandelson,  who  said  the  Tories  were  afraid  of  Mr  Campbell's  campaigning  skills.  He  warned  the  BBC  that  attacking  Mr  Campbell  had  brought  it  trouble  before.  That  was  a  reference  to  the  Hutton  inquiry  following  a  BBC  story  claiming  Downing  Street  ""sexed  up""  Iraq's  weapons  of  mass  destruction  dossier.  |||    The  affair  prompted  the  resignation  of  BBC  chairman  Gavyn  Davies,  director-general  Greg  Dyke  and  reporter  Andrew  Gilligan.  Labour  has  attracted  media  criticism  for  using  new  freedom  of  information  laws  to  dig  up  information  about  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard's  past.  |||    Mr  Mandelson,  a  former  Labour  communications  director,  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""I  understand  why  the  Tories  will  be  gunning  for  Alastair  Campbell  because  they  fear  his  campaigning  skills.  ""What  I  understand  less  is  why  the  BBC  should  be  joining  with  the  Tories  in  driving  that  agenda.  ""In  my  experience  of  these  things,  parties  which  shout  about  dirty  tricks  and  the  like  tend  to  do  so  because  they  fear  a  direct  hit  in  some  vulnerable  part  of  their  political  anatomy.  ""I  suggest  the  BBC  concentrates  on  the  issues  and  helps  the  public  to  understand  the  policies  and  the  choices  that  are  at  stake  in  the  election  rather  than  engages  in  the  process  politics,  the  trivialisation  of  the  campaign.  ""I  think  the  BBC  would  be  much  better  advised  to  leave  all  this  stuff  well  alone,  concentrate  on  the  issues  as  I  say,  not  resume  their  demonisation  of  Alastair  Campbell  -  we  all  know  where  that  led  before.""  |||    Mr  Campbell  is  acting  as  an  adviser  for  Labour,  which  denies  engaging  in  personal  campaigning.  Conservative  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  said  Mr  Campbell's  return  and  Labour  poster  plans  attacking  Mr  Howard  -  recently  withdrawn  from  the  party's  website  -  were  a  sign  of  ""abusive  politics"".  ""The  government,  despite  the  fact  that  they  would  say  want  to  go  forward,  not  back,  seem  intent  on  talking  about  history  rather  than  their  own  record  or  even  more  importantly,  about  the  future,""  he  said  on  Sunday.  Labour  peer  Baroness  Kennedy,  who  is  chairing  the  Power  Inquiry  into  political  disengagement,  said  people  already  thought  politicians  engaged  in  dirty  tricks.  ""This  feeling  of  distrust  is  going  to  be  enlarged  if  this  campaigning  on  all  sides  is  conducted  in  the  way  that  it  looks  as  if  it  just  might,""  she  said."

It  blamed  poor  sales  since  Christmas  and  delays  to  the  releases  of  new  albums  by  Coldplay  and  Gorillaz.  By  1200  GMT  on  Monday,  EMI  shares  were  down  16.2%  at  235.75  pence.  |||    EMI  said  two  major  albums  scheduled  for  release  before  the  end  of  the  financial  year  in  March  -  one  by  Coldplay  and  one  by  Gorillaz  -  have  now  had  their  release  dates  put  back.  |||    ""EMI  Music's  sales,  particularly  re-orders,  in  January  have  also  been  lower  than  anticipated  and  this  is  expected  to  continue  through  February  and  March,""  the  company  added.  ""Therefore,  for  the  full  year,  at  constant  currency,  EMI  Music's  sales  are  now  expected  to  be  8%  to  9%  lower  than  the  prior  year.""  The  company  said  it  expected  profits  to  be  about  £138m  ($259.8m).  Alain  Levy,  chairman  and  chief  executive  of  EMI  Music,  described  the  performance  as  ""disappointing"",  but  added  that  he  remained  optimistic  over  future  trends  in  the  industry.  ""The  physical  music  market  is  showing  signs  of  stabilisation  in  many  parts  of  the  world  and  digital  music,  in  all  its  forms,  continues  to  develop  at  a  rapid  pace,""  he  said.  |||    Commenting  on  the  delay  to  the  release  of  the  Coldplay  and  Gorillaz  albums,  Mr  Levy  said  that  ""creating  and  marketing  music  is  not  an  exact  science  and  cannot  always  coincide  with  our  reporting  periods"".  ""While  this  rescheduling  and  recent  softness  is  disappointing,  it  does  not  change  my  views  of  the  improving  health  of  the  global  recorded  music  industry,""  he  added.  Paul  Richards,  an  analyst  at  Numis  Securities,  said  the  market  would  be  focusing  on  the  slump  in  music  sales  rather  than  the  timing  of  the  two  albums.  ""It's  unusual  to  see  this  much  of  a  downgrade  just  because  of  phasing,""  he  said."

The  average  UK  house  price  fell  from  £180,126  in  November  to  £178,906,  reflecting  recent  Land  Registry  figures  confirming  a  slowdown  in  late  2004.  All  major  UK  regions,  apart  from  Northern  Ireland,  experienced  a  fall  in  annual  growth  during  December.  |||    December  is  traditionally  a  quiet  month  for  the  housing  market  because  of  Christmas  celebrations.  However,  recent  figures  from  the  Land  Registry  -  showing  a  big  drop  in  sales  between  the  last  quarter  of  2004  and  the  previous  year  -  suggested  the  slowdown  could  be  more  than  a  seasonal  blip.  The  volume  of  sales  between  October  and  December  dropped  by  nearly  a  quarter  from  the  same  period  in  2003,  the  Land  Registry  said.  Although  both  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  (ODPM)  and  the  Land  Registry  figures  point  to  a  slowdown  in  the  market,  the  most  recent  surveys  from  Nationwide  and  Halifax  have  indicated  the  market  may  be  undergoing  a  revival.  After  registering  falls  at  the  back-end  of  2004,  Halifax  said  house  prices  rose  by  0.8%  in  January  and  Nationwide  reported  a  rise  of  0.4%  in  the  first  month  of  the  year." 

0	"Fiat  chief  takes  steering  wheel  |||    The  chief  executive  of  the  Fiat  conglomerate  has  taken  day-to-day  control  of  its  struggling  car  business  in  an  effort  to  turn  it  around.  |||    Sergio  Marchionne  has  replaced  Herbert  Demel  as  chief  executive  of  Fiat  Auto,  with  Mr  Demel  leaving  the  company.  Mr  Marchionne  becomes  the  fourth  head  of  the  business  -  which  is  expected  to  make  a  800m  euro  ($1bn)  loss  in  2004  -  in  as  many  years.  Fiat  underperformed  the  market  in  Europe  last  year,  seeing  flat  sales.  |||    The  car  business  has  made  an  operating  loss  in  five  of  the  last  six  years  and  was  forced  to  push  back  its  break-even  target  from  2005  to  2006.  The  management  changes  are  part  of  a  wider  shake-up  of  the  business  following  Fiat's  resolution  of  its  dispute  with  General  Motors.  As  part  of  a  major  restructuring,  Fiat  is  to  integrate  the  Maserati  car  company  -  currently  owned  by  Ferrari  -  within  its  own  operations.  Ferrari,  in  which  Fiat  owns  a  majority  stake,  could  be  separately  floated  on  the  stock  market  in  either  2006  or  2007.  |||    Mr  Marchionne,  who  only  joined  the  company  last  year,  said  Fiat  Auto  was  now  the  ""principal  focus""  of  his  attention.  ""I  have  made  the  decision  to  take  on  the  post  of  chief  executive  of  the  auto  unit  to  speed  up  the  company's  recovery,""  he  said.  ""A  profound  cultural  transformation  is  underway  following  a  management  reorganisation  that  has  delivered  a  more  agile  and  efficient  structure,""  he  added.  |||    Although  Mr  Marchionne  does  not  have  a  background  in  the  car  industry,  he  has  been  playing  an  increasing  role  in  the  group's  activities.  Last  year,  he  said  that  a  series  of  new  models,  launched  as  part  of  the  group's  recovery  plan,  had  not  boosted  revenues  as  much  as  hoped.  The  car  business,  best  known  for  its  Alfa  Romeo  marque,  is  expected  to  make  a  loss  of  about  800m  euros  in  2004.  Sales  are  expected  to  fall  in  2005,  Fiat  said  this  week,  as  it  exits  unprofitable  areas  such  as  the  rental  car  market.  Mr  Demel,  a  car  industry  veteran,  took  the  helm  in  November  2003  after  being  recruited  by  former  Fiat  chief  executive  Giuseppe  Morchio.  Mr  Morchio  made  a  bid  last  year  to  become  chairman  after  the  death  of  president  Umberto  Agnelli.  However,  this  was  rejected  by  the  founding  Agnelli  family  and  Mr  Morchio  subsequently  resigned.  Earlier  this  week,  Fiat  reached  an  agreement  with  GM  to  dissolve  an  alliance  which  could  have  obliged  GM  to  buy  the  Italian  firm  outright.  GM  will  pay  Fiat  $2bn  as  part  of  the  settlement." 

3	"Safin  plays  down  Wimbledon  hopes  |||    Newly-crowned  Australian  Open  champion  Marat  Safin  has  ruled  out  any  chance  of  winning  Wimbledon  in  the  future.  |||    After  losing  in  round  one  last  year,  Safin  said  he  had  ""given  up""  on  Wimbledon  and  winning  his  second  Grand  Slam  title  has  not  changed  his  mind.  ""I'll  play,  but  with  no  expectations.  I  feel  like  I  can't  waste  my  time,  my  energy  on  that  surface,""  he  said.  ""Some  people,  they  cannot  play  on  clay.  Some  people,  they  cannot  play  on  a  hard  court.  Me,  I  can't  play  on  grass.""  However,  Safin  is  hopeful  that  winning  the  Australian  Open  will  give  him  the  belief  he  needs  to  win  more  Grand  Slam  titles.  ""It's  a  relief  for  me.  Two  grand  slams,  it's  already  something.  But  with  this  one  I  worked  really  hard  for  it,""  he  said.  ""Basically,  I  would  love  to  win  a  couple  more.  I  think  I  have  a  chance  if  I  continue  this  way.  |||    ""If  (coach)  Peter  Lundgren  will  stick  around  with  me  and  wants  to  work  with  me  for  a  bit  longer,  I  think  I  can  make  it.""  The  25-year-old  shocked  Pete  Sampras  in  the  2000  US  Open  final  to  win  his  first  major  title  but  then  lost  in  two  Australian  Open  finals.  Safin  admitted  he  had  begun  to  doubt  whether  he  would  win  another  Grand  Slam.  ""I  didn't  expect  that  (to  win  the  2000  US  Open)  -  it  was  against  Sampras,  I  wasn't  the  favourite  so  I  had  no  pressure  whatsoever,""  he  said.  ""After  the  first  final  that  I  didn't  win  against  Thomas  Johansson  (in  2002),  I  couldn't  see  myself  winning  the  Grand  Slams  anymore.  ""I  was  once  in  the  semi-finals  of  the  French  Open,  but  I  didn't  believe  I  can  win  it.  ""I  just  couldn't  handle  the  pressure.  You  need  to  believe  in  yourself,  and  I  didn't.""  |||    And  after  losing  the  first  set  6-1  to  Lleyton  Hewitt  in  Sunday's  final,  Safin  said  he  began  to  doubt  himself  again.  ""I  am  25.  I'm  playing  against  Hewitt.  At  least  you  have  to  have  the  opportunity  to  win  it,  at  least  have  a  chance,""  he  said.  ""It's  like  you  go  there  and  you  lose  first  set  6-1,  then  you  start  to  think:  'This  is  not  my  day.  The  way  I'm  playing  is  ridiculous.'  ""But  then  you  start  to  really  be  a  little  bit  more  selfish  and  try  to  find  a  way  out  of  there.  ""And  I  found  it.  I  was  like  really  much  I  was  much  happier  than  in  2000,  that's  for  sure,  because  I  get  over  it."""

It  features  the  singer  talking  about  both  his  career  and  his  personal  life,  from  his  days  in  Wham!  through  to  more  recent  events.  Michael  will  attend  the  festival  to  introduce  the  screening  on  16  February.  Director  Southan  Morris  and  executive  producer  Andy  Stephens  will  also  attend  the  festival.  |||    The  93  minute  film  will  see  Michael  discussing  his  early  days  in  Wham!  along  with  his  later  career,  including  his  legal  battles  with  record  label  Sony  and  his  stance  against  the  Iraq  war  and  American  politics.  It  will  also  touch  upon  his  turbulent  personal  life,  including  his  arrest  in  a  Beverly  Hills  park  toilet  in  1998  for  ""lewd  behaviour"",  and  the  death  of  his  boyfriend  Anselmo  Feleppa  from  Aids.

2	"Analysis:  No  pain,  no  gain?  |||    He  called  it  his  ""masochism  strategy""  in  the  run-up  to  the  Iraq  war  and  now  Tony  Blair  has  signed  up  for  another  dose  of  pain.  |||    The  idea  is  simple  -  the  prime  minister  goes  head  to  head  with  an  often  hostile  group  of  ""real""  voters  in  the  full  spotlight  of  the  television  cameras.  The  theory  is  that  talking  to  the  great  British  public,  even  if  they  are  the  ""great  unwashed"",  is  better  than  having  the  media  filter  what  voters  hear  from  politicians.  It  is  also  the  most  effective  way  of  showing  that  he  is  aware  of  real  people's  concerns  and  -  on  occasions  -  of  their  outright  fury.  Mr  Blair  used  the  tactic  before  the  Iraq  war  to  try  to  show  he  really  was  engaging  with  public  concerns  and  you  can  expect  to  see  it  much  more  in  the  run-up  to  the  election.  |||    Labour  knows  it  has  been  damaged  by  accusations  of  spin,  ""control  freakery""  and  over-slick  presentation  -  sometimes  from  within  the  ranks  of  its  own  MPs.  Tony  Blair  himself  has  said  people  complain  he  does  not  listen.  Mr  Blair's  latest  bout  of  flagellation  came  with  a  series  of  questions  sessions  on  Five  television  throughout  Wednesday.  |||    The  trouble  began  on  the  Wright  Stuff  show,  with  Maria  Hutchings  marching  up  to  him,  saying  ""Tony,  that's  rubbish""  as  she  tried  to  complain  about  her  autistic  son's  school  being  threatened  with  closure.  A  few  ""don't  worries""  as  Mrs  Hutchings  was  led  back  to  the  audience  averted  a  public  slanging  match  -  he  spoke  to  her  privately  after  the  show.  But  that  was  only  the  start  and  later  sessions  produced  the  type  of  grilling  not  even  the  toughest  television  interviewer  could  produce.  |||    Writer  Neil  Coppendale,  from  West  Sussex,  asked  of  the  Iraq  war:  ""Tens  of  thousands  of  innocent  men,  women  and  children  died  -  how  do  you  manage  to  sleep  at  night?""  On  immigration,  London  teacher  Diane  Granger  said:  ""Where  are  you  going  to  put  everyone?""  And  can  you  imagine  even  Jeremy  Paxman  putting  the  question  posed  by  Brighton  nurse  Marion  Brown:  ""Would  you  wipe  somebody's  backside  for  £5?""  |||    Mr  Blair  tried  to  use  the  questioners'  first  names  -  and  sometimes  threw  them  off  their  stride  by  asking  what  they  would  do  about  the  problems.  Many  of  the  newspapers  have  branded  the  exercise  a  PR  stunt  which  backfired.  Indeed  there  is  a  danger  Mr  Blair  simply  ends  up  looking  ""embattled"".  Conservative  Michael  Howard  and  Liberal  Democrat  Charles  Kennedy  are  to  be  offered  chances  to  appear  in  similar  slots  on  the  channel  next  month.  Labour  strategists  believe  more  of  the  sessions  will  mean  the  hecklers  no  longer  become  a  story  and  the  real  issues  take  prominence.  |||    James  Humphreys,  ex-head  of  corporate  communications  at  Number  10,  says  the  strategy  shows  frustration  with  the  media.  ""They  feel  they  don't  get  their  voice  across  and  going  direct  to  people  is  clearly  their  game  on  this  occasion,""  he  says.  There  are  risks  but  the  prize  is  tackling  the  trend  of  lower  turnouts  at  the  polls,  he  argues.  The  prime  minister  knows  full  well  the  potential  hazards  .  |||    He  must  remember  with  gritted  teeth  his  confrontation  with  Sharron  Storer,  the  Birmingham  woman  who  harangued  him  over  the  state  of  her  local  hospital  in  the  2001  election  campaign.  ""All  you  do  is  walk  around  and  make  yourself  known,  you  don't  do  anything  to  help  anybody,""  she  told  Mr  Blair  before  stomping  off,  refusing  his  pleas  to  discuss  the  issue  privately.  Former  Downing  Street  media  chief  Alastair  Campbell  has  described  the  episode  as  a  ""bit  of  a  disaster""  as  it  meant  the  launch  of  Labour's  election  manifesto  received  little  coverage.  But  it  was  seen  as  one  of  the  few  moments  when  that  election  campaign  came  alive,  not  least  because  it  coincided  with  John  Prescott's  even  more  direct  contact  -  when  he  punched  an  egg-throwing  protester.  |||    Former  prime  ministers  too  have  come  to  grief  at  the  hands  of  a  persistent  member  of  the  public.  The  undoubted  highlight  of  years  of  election  phone-in  shows  was  Margaret  Thatcher  discomfort  on  Nationwide  in  1983,  when  viewer  Diana  Gould  put  her  on  the  spot  about  the  sinking  of  the  Belgrano  in  the  Falklands  War.  John  Major  reaped  the  benefits  of  street  campaigning  during  the  1992  election  campaign  with  his  famous  soapbox.  |||    It  may  have  left  him  splattered  with  eggs  and  engine  oil  at  times  but  he  felt  it  added  ""fizz""  to  his  campaign.  In  his  memoirs,  he  also  argues  the  strategy  contrasted  with  Neil  Kinnock's  ""contrived  photo  opportunities""  and  attempts  at  an  artful  campaign.  ""He  wanted  to  look  like  a  prime  minister.  I  |||    was  |||    prime  minister  and  I  wanted  a  flesh  and  blood  fight,""  says  Mr  Major.  Mr  Blair  told  prospective  Labour  MPs  on  Thursday  that  taking  part  in  phone-ins  and  public  meetings  could  ""enthuse  and  engage  and  give  the  public  a  sense  of  empowerment"".  But  he  also  wants  to  counter  complaints  that  he  has  spent  too  much  time  on  international  affairs  and  foreign  trips.  Mr  Blair  recalls  how  Bill  Clinton  once  advised  him:  ""Always  remember  that  what  people  see  of  you  in  the  news  in  the  evening  is  how  they  think  you  spend  your  day.""  His  hope  must  be  that  voters  watching  him  on  the  rack  will  bear  out  for  Labour  the  old  maxim:  ""No  pain,  no  gain.""" 

3	"Bates  seals  takeover  |||    Ken  Bates  has  completed  his  takeover  of  Leeds  United.  |||    The  73-year-old  former  Chelsea  chairman  sealed  the  deal  at  0227  GMT  on  Friday,  and  has  bought  a  50%  stake  in  the  club.  He  said:  ""I'm  delighted  to  be  stepping  up  to  the  mantel  at  such  a  fantastic  club.  I  recognise  Leeds  as  a  great  club  that  has  fallen  on  hard  times.  ""We  have  a  lot  of  hard  work  ahead  to  get  the  club  back  where  it  belongs  in  the  Premiership,  and  with  the  help  of  our  fans  we  will  do  everything  we  can.""  Bates  bought  his  stake  under  the  guise  of  a  Geneva-based  company  known  as  The  Forward  Sports  Fund.  He  revealed  that  part  of  his  plan  is  to  buy  back  Leeds'  Elland  Road  stadium  and  Thorp  Arch  training  ground  in  due  course.  |||    ""It's  going  to  be  a  tough  jon  and  the  first  task  is  to  stabilise  the  cash  flow  and  sort  out  the  remaining  creditors,""  Bates  added.  ""But  there  is  light  at  the  end  of  a  very  long  tunnel.  For  the  past  year  it  has  been  a  matter  of  firefighting  -  now  we  can  start  running  the  club  again.""  Outgoing  Leeds  chairman  Gerald  Krasner  said:  ""This  deal  ensures  the  medium  to  long  term  survival  of  the  club  and  I  believe  Mr  Bates'  proposals  are  totally  for  the  benefit  of  the  club.  ""We  are  content  that  under  Mr  Bates,  Leeds  United  will  continue  to  consolidate  and  move  forward.  ""When  we  took  over  Leeds  United  in  March  2004,  the  club  had  a  debt  of  £103m,  since  that  date,  my  board  has  succeeded  in  reducing  the  debt  to  under  £25m.  ""We  worked  tirelessly  to  solve  all  of  the  problems  at  Leeds  United.  ""Eighty  percent  of  the  problems  have  already  been  overcome  and  we  came  to  this  agreement  with  Mr  Bates  to  secure  its  ongoing  success.""  Krasner  revealed  that  his  consortium  has  been  asked  to  remain  in  the  background  at  the  club  for  an  undisclosed  period  to  help  ensure  a  smooth  hand-over.  He  will  stay  on  in  an  unpaid  capacity  while  Peter  Lorimer  will  continue  in  his  role  as  director  and  point  of  contact  for  the  fans  and  Peter  McCormick  will  serve  as  a  consultant  to  the  incoming  board.  The  other  outgoing  directors  have  agreed  to  leave  their  loans  of  £4.5m  in  the  company  for  the  next  four  years.  On  Leeds'  new-look  board  it  is  understood  that  Lorimer  will  be  joined  by  former  Chelsea  finance  director  Yvonne  Todd  and  Bates'  lawyer  Mark  Taylor.  |||    Krasner  refused  to  give  any  details  of  the  finances  involved  in  the  takeover.  He  told  BBC  Five  Live:  ""I  am  not  going  into  the  figures.  If  Ken  wants  to  give  them  up  that  is  up  to  him.  I  can  not  tell  you  what  the  money  will  be  used  for.  ""This  dea  l  is  not  about  money  for  the  current  board.  In  the  last  four  months  I  never  saw  any  cheques  until  this  week  from  one  person.  I  am  not  stretching  figures,  we  don't  discuss  internal  arrangements.""  Bates  stepped  down  as  Chelsea  chairman  in  March  last  year  following  Roman  Abramovich's  £140m  takeover  at  Stamford  Bridge.  In  May,  he  made  a  proposal  to  invest  £10m  in  Sheffield  Wednesday,  but  this  was  rejected  by  the  club.  Sebastien  Sainsbury  had  been  close  to  a  takeover  of  Leeds  but  withdrew  his  £25m  offer  last  week.  |||    His  efforts  failed  after  he  revealed  it  would  take  £40m  to  stage  a  takeover,  and  that  the  club  will  also  lose  £10m  over  the  next  six  months.  The  club  was  on  the  brink  of  administration  -  and  the  deduction  of  10  points  by  the  Football  League  -  before  Bates'  arrival  but  his  investment  has  spared  them  that  prospect." 

2	"Burglar  defence  guidelines  issued  |||    Householders  who  injure  or  even  kill  intruders  are  unlikely  to  be  prosecuted  -  providing  they  were  acting  ""honestly  and  instinctively"",  new  guidelines  say.  |||    The  law  also  protects  those  who  use  ""something  to  hand""  as  a  weapon.  The  leaflet,  published  by  police  and  prosecutors,  aims  to  combat  confusion  about  current  legislation,  which  lets  people  use  ""reasonable  force"".  The  guidance,  relating  to  England  and  Wales,  follows  a  recent  decision  by  ministers  not  to  change  the  law.  Doing  what  you  ""honestly  and  instinctively""  believed  was  necessary  would  be  the  strongest  evidence  of  acting  lawfully,  the  guidance  said.  |||    And  the  law  protects  those  who  use  ""something  to  hand""  as  a  weapon,  said  the  leaflet  published  jointly  by  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service  (CPS)  and  Association  of  Chief  Police  Officers  (ACPO).  |||    As  a  general  rule,  the  more  extreme  the  circumstances  and  fear  felt,  the  more  force  can  be  used  lawfully  in  self-defence,  it  said,  adding  that  householders  do  not  have  to  wait  to  be  attacked  before  defending  themselves.  But  knocking  someone  unconscious  then  killing  them  or  hurting  them  further,  or  setting  a  trap  for  an  intruder  without  involving  the  police  were  given  as  examples  of  ""excessive  and  gratuitous""  force.  The  Tories  have  called  for  a  change  in  the  law  so  householders  are  only  prosecuted  if  they  use  ""grossly  disproportionate""  force.  Their  demands  have  been  backed  by  former  Metropolitan  Police  Commissioner  Sir  John  Stevens.  Tory  frontbencher  Patrick  Mercer  is  now  pursuing  the  proposal  through  a  private  member's  bill  in  Parliament.  |||    The  government  instead  mounted  a  publicity  campaign  to  clear  up  public  uncertainty  after  a  review  concluded  no  law  change  was  necessary.  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  said:  ""I  believe  in  that  old  adage  'an  Englishman's  home  is  his  castle'.  That's  exactly  what  should  be  the  case  and  I  believe  the  current  law  provides  that.""  An  ""informal  trawl""  of  CPS  records  found  11  people  had  been  prosecuted  after  attacking  intruders  in  the  past  15  years,  five  of  whom  were  convicted.  They  included  a  man  who  laid  in  wait  for  a  burglar  on  commercial  premises  in  Cheshire,  before  beating  him  up,  throwing  him  into  a  pit  and  setting  him  on  fire.  |||    A  CPS  spokesperson  said  the  figures  were  not  definitive  because  prosecutions  are  not  listed  according  to  whether  they  were  committed  by  a  householder  on  an  intruder.  In  one  of  Britain's  highest  profile  cases,  Norfolk  farmer  Tony  Martin  was  jailed  for  life  for  murdering  16-year-old  burglar  Fred  Barras,  in  1999.  The  conviction  was  later  reduced  to  manslaughter  on  appeal  and  the  sentence  cut  to  five  years.  Mr  Martin  was  freed  from  prison  in  July  2003.  The  guidance  published  on  Tuesday,  said  the  police  had  a  duty  to  investigate  all  incidents  involving  a  death  or  injury.  In  cases  involving  householders  attacking  intruders  prosecutors  and  police  were  ""determined""  they  would  be  dealt  with  ""as  swiftly  and  as  sympathetically  as  possible"",  it  said." 

0	"Fresh  hope  after  Argentine  crisis  |||    Three  years  after  Argentina  was  hit  by  a  deadly  economic  crisis,  there  is  fresh  hope.  |||    The  country's  economy  is  set  to  grow  about  8%  this  year  after  seeing  9%  growth  last  year,  a  sharp  turnaround  from  2002  when  output  fell  11%.  The  unemployment  rate  is  improving,  too:  It  is  set  to  slip  below  13%  by  the  end  of  the  year,  down  from  20%  in  May  2002.  True,  problems  remain,  but  the  overall  picture  is  one  of  vast  improvement.  Even  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  admits  this.  ""The  Argentine  authorities  are  proud,  should  be  proud,  of  the  strong  performance  of  the  economy,""  Thomas  Dawson,  an  IMF  director,  said  earlier  this  month.  |||    Argentina  has  made  a  remarkable  recovery  from  a  hideous  and  lengthy  recession  which  in  2001  culminated  in  the  government  halting  debt  repayments  to  its  private  creditors.  The  debt  default  sparked  a  deep  and  prolonged  economic  crisis  which,  at  least  initially,  was  made  worse  by  the  government's  decisions.  Pension  payments  were  halted  and  bank  accounts  frozen  as  part  of  austerity  measures  introduced  by  the  government  to  deal  with  the  country's  massive  debts.  In  response,  angry  crowds  of  ordinary  Argentines  took  to  the  streets  where  dozens  of  lives  were  lost  in  clashes  with  the  police.  Two  presidents  and  at  least  three  finance  minister  resigned  in  less  than  a  month.  Argentina  was  on  the  brink  of  collapse.  The  fix  was  found  in  the  currency  markets  with  the  abandonment  of  the  peso's  decade-long  peg  to  the  US  dollar  in  February  2002.  The  subsequent  devaluation  saw  thousands  of  people's  life  savings  disappear.  Scathes  of  companies  went  bust.  ""Three  years  ago,  every  sector  [of  the  economy]  was  hit  by  the  crisis,""  said  entrepreneur  Drayton  Valentine.  It  really  was  dire.  |||    But  since  then,  the  general  mood  on  the  ground  has  improved  dramatically,  in  part  because  the  devaluation  helped  attract  fresh  direct  investment  from  abroad  and  stimulate  business  within  Brazil.  ""Agriculture  and  tourism  are  helping,""  said  entrepreneur  Drayton  Valentine.  |||    Mr  Valentine,  who  was  born  in  the  United  States  but  grew  up  in  Argentina,  was  fortunate:  At  the  time  of  the  crisis,  his  savings  were  held  in  dollar  accounts  abroad.  But  now  he  is  using  his  money  to  help  with  the  start-up  a  trading  company.  He  explained  that  initially,  his  firm  is  going  to  export  building  materials  to  Spain  and  United  States.  Then,  he  would  like  to  diversify  to  other  areas,  depending  on  the  market.  ""Locally  there  is  a  sense  of  recovery,  many  companies  are  exporting  now,""  he  said,  noting  that  a  lot  of  firms,  which  were  closed  during  the  crisis,  are  re-opening.  |||    But  not  all  that  shines  is  gold.  Argentina  is  still  burdened  by  its  failure  to  pay  private  creditors  at  the  end  of  2001.  President  Nestor  Kirchner's  administration  is  still  trying  to  hammer  out  an  agreement  with  the  creditors,  but  with  the  debts'  nominal  value  standing  at  around  $100bn  it  is  not  proving  easy.  Debt  defaults  make  further  lending  agreements  both  difficult  and  expensive  to  negotiate.  Argentina's  current  offer  implies  that  the  creditors  would  get  just  25  cents  for  each  dollar  they  are  owed,  according  to  the  creditors.  Understandably,  they  want  more  and  until  they  do,  both  they  and  others  are  loath  to  continue  lending.  For  President  Kirchner,  this  proves  a  hopeless  challenge.  Real  losses  have  been  suffered  and  somebody  has  to  pay,  observed  Jack  Boorman,  adviser  to  IMF's  managing  director,  Rodrigo  Rato.  ""Everyone  needs  to  keep  in  mind  the  enormous  cost  on  the  part  of  both  creditors  and  the  Argentine  society  and  people  that  will  have  been  endured  by  the  time  a  settlement  is  reached,""  he  said.  ""The  cost  is  enormous,  and  continues  to  be  paid,  and  will  not  be  reversed  by  any  restructuring.""  |||    With  the  international  negotiations  being  troubled,  it  is  of  little  help  to  President  Kirchner  that  the  domestic  situation  remains  strained  as  well.  |||    This  is  partly  because  there  are  still  bank  account  holders  who  are  waiting  to  recover  some  of  their  deposits.  ""The  situation  is  bad  for  those  who  had  previously  chosen  to  save  in  Argentina,  ""  said  Carlos  Baez  Silva,  president  of  AARA,  an  association  that  represents  bank  account  and  bond  holders.  Few  people  have  recovered  more  than  about  half  their  savings,  Mr  Baez  Silva  estimated,  pointing  out  that  many  of  the  savers  who  have  lost  out  are  pensioners  or  others  who  once  trusted  the  government,  people  who  set  aside  money  for  the  future  in  the  belief  that  their  investment  would  be  safe.  ""A  lot  of  them  invested  in  good  faith,""  he  said.  ""The  Argentine  state  responded  by  taking  most  of  their  investments.""  The  affair  has  made  Mr  Baez  Silva  disillusioned  with  the  country's  legal  system.  On  occasion,  the  Supreme  Court  has  ruled  against  the  interests  of  the  people  he  represents,  he  says,  insisting  that  the  system  cannot  be  trusted.  ""People  have  to  deposit  their  money  in  the  banks,  not  necessarily  because  they  trust  them  but  because  crime  is  so  high  that  people  cannot  have  their  money  in  their  homes  beneath  their  mattresses.""  Mr  Valentine,  who  was  born  in  the  United  States  but  grew  up  in  Argentina,  agreed.  ""If  I  have  to  save  pesos  [the  local  currency]  there  is  not  much  problem,  but  I  will  think  twice  before  I  deposit  dollars  in  a  bank""." 

2	"Clarke  plans  migrant  point  scheme  |||    Anyone  planning  to  move  to  the  UK  will  have  to  pass  a  test  to  prove  they  can  contribute  to  the  country,  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  has  said.  |||    He  is  proposing  a  points  system  similar  to  Australia's  but  would  avoid  the  quota  system  planned  by  the  Tories.  Mr  Clarke,  who  will  unveil  his  plans  on  Monday,  said  economic  migration  helped  the  UK  but  ""needed  proper  policing"".  The  Lib  Dems  say  they  will  look  at  his  plans,  but  Tory  Liam  Fox  said  his  party  offered  a  ""clear  choice""  on  the  issue.  The  Conservative  Party  Co-Chairman  said  the  British  electorate  had  a  choice  between  a  Labour  government  that  had  ""done  nothing  for  eight  years  and  will  not  set  a  limit""  on  immigration  and  a  Tory  one  that  would  impose  quotas.  |||    The  home  secretary  said,  by  2008,  he  wanted  everyone  given  a  visa  and  entering  the  UK  to  have  their  fingerprints  taken,  to  ""ensure  we  can  know  everybody  who  is  in  the  country"".  Speaking  on  BBC  One's  Breakfast  with  Frost,  he  said  ""economic  migrants  are  of  great  value  to  this  country"",  but  stressed  that  proper  policing  was  needed  to  ensure  that  they  do  not  become  a  ""burden  on  society"".  He  said:  ""We  will  establish  a  system  ...  which  looks  at  the  skills,  talents  and  abilities  of  people  seeking  to  come  and  work  in  this  country,  and  ensures  that  when  they  come  here  they  have  a  job  and  can  contribute  to  the  economy  of  the  country.""  |||    The  home  secretary,  whose  five-year  blueprint  for  immigration  and  asylum  is  expected  to  be  published  on  Monday,  also  rejected  claims  that  the  immigration  debate  encouraged  bigotry.  ""The  issue  of  who  does  come  into  this  country,  and  whether  they  are  entitled  to  be  in  this  country,  who  does  settle  here,  how  we  have  border  controls,  is  a  perfectly  legitimate  aspect  of  public  debate,""  he  said.  Liberal  Democrat  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  said:  ""Whilst  it  is  good  that  Labour  has  rejected  the  Tory  idea  of  quotas  on  asylum,  the  jury  is  still  out  on  the  Home  Office's  ability  to  deliver  a  fair  and  efficient  asylum  system.""  |||    Mr  Howard  has  said  Britain  should  take  its  fair  share  of  the  world's  ""genuine  refugees"".  But  he  claims  the  current  asylum  system  is  being  abused  -  and  with  it  Britain's  generosity.  Trevor  Phillips,  chairman  of  the  Commission  for  Racial  Equality,  called  on  Mr  Clarke  to  denounce  the  suggestion  Britain's  hospitality  was  being  tested  by  immigration.  ""Tell  that  to  the  44,000  doctors  in  the  NHS  and  the  70,000  nurses  without  whom  we  would  really  see  what  pressure  on  the  health  service  means,""  he  said.  ""Ditto  the  teachers,  from  South  Africa,  Australia,  Jamaica,  who  are  reducing  the  sizes  of  our  classes  and  schools.""  The  Refugee  Council  said  Mr  Howard's  proposals  would  mean  there  would  be  no  safe  haven  in  the  UK." 

0	"LSE  doubts  boost  bidders'  shares  |||    Shares  in  Deutsche  Boerse  have  risen  more  than  3%  after  a  shareholder  fund  voiced  opposition  to  the  firm's  planned  takeover  of  the  London  Stock  Exchange.  |||    TCI,  which  claims  to  represent  owners  of  5%  of  Deutsche  Boerse's  (DB)  shares,  has  complained  that  the  £1.35bn  ($2.5bn)  offer  for  the  LSE  is  too  high.  Opposition  from  TCI  has  fuelled  speculation  that  the  proposed  takeover  could  fail.  Rival  exchange  operator  Euronext  has  also  said  it  may  bid  for  the  LSE.  Euronext  operates  the  Paris,  Amsterdam,  Brussels  and  Lisbon  bourses,  while  Deutsche  Boerse  runs  the  Frankfurt  exchange.  |||    BBC  News  spoke  to  a  number  of  analysts  on  Monday  morning  about  shareholder  worries  over  Deutsche  Boerse's  bid  for  LSE.  Although  none  were  prepared  to  speak  on  the  record,  most  thought  it  was  unlikely  that  TCI's  opposition  would  halt  the  deal  |||    ""Obviously  we'll  have  to  wait  and  see,  but  I  don't  think  it  will  make  much  difference.  Deutsche  Boerse  appears  very  committed,""  said  one  London-based  broker.  He  forecast  the  takeover  bid  would  succeed  and  was  more  concerned  to  see  improvements  in  the  daily  running  of  the  LSE.  In  voicing  its  opposition  to  the  planned  takeover,  TCI  said  it  would  prefer  to  see  Deutsche  Boerse  return  $500m  (£350m)  to  shareholders.  The  Deutsche  Boerse  was  prepared  to  pay  for  the  LSE  ""exceeds  the  potential  benefits  of  this  acquisition"",  said  TCI.  |||    Another  Deutsche  Boerse  shareholder  on  Monday  also  appeared  to  back  TCI's  call.  Another  investor  in  Deutsche  Boerse  has  supported  the  view  that  a  payout  to  shareholders  would  be  preferable  to  Deutsche  Boerse  overpaying  for  the  LSE,  Reuters  news  agency  reported.  ""We  prefer  a  sensible  entrepreneurial  solution  at  a  price  that  is  not  too  high,""  said  Rolf  Dress,  a  spokesman  for  Union  Investment.  ""If  that  cannot  be  achieved,  then  we  would  wish  for  a  distribution  of  liquid  assets  to  shareholders.""  The  Financial  Times  also  reported  a  third  Deutsche  Boerse  shareholder  as  opposed  to  the  deal.  It  quoted  a  spokesman  for  US-based  hedge  fund  Atticus  Capital  complaining  that  the  planned  takeover  appeared  to  be  motivated  by  ""empire-building""  rather  than  the  best  interests  of  shareholders.  |||    TCI  has  called  for  Deutsche  Boerse  to  hold  an  emergency  general  meeting  to  discuss  the  bid  for  LSE.  Yet  under  German  business  law,  DB  does  not  have  to  gain  shareholder  approval  before  making  a  significant  acquisition.  Deutsche  Boerse  said  TCI's  opposition  would  not  change  its  bid  approach.  ""Deutsche  Boerse  is  convinced  that  its  contemplated  cash  acquisition  of  the  London  Stock  Exchange  is  in  the  best  interests  of  its  shareholders  and  the  company,""  it  said.  DB's  shares  were  up  3.4%  to  45.25  euros  by  1030  GMT,  the  highest  gainer  in  Frankfurt."

The  company,  China's  third-largest  milk  producer,  is  to  hold  an  emergency  meeting  to  debate  the  issue.  A  Yili  spokesman  said  it  may  now  move  to  oust  chairman  Zheng  Junhuai.  The  spokesman  did  not  say  why  the  three  had  been  detained  by  the  police.  The  official  Xinhua  News  Agency  said  the  arrest  was  linked  to  alleged  embezzlement.  |||    Yili  has  recently  been  the  subject  of  intense  media  speculation  over  its  financial  operations.  Executives  are  suspected  of  wrongly  using  417m  yuan  ($50.4m;  £26m)  of  company  funds  to  support  a  management  buyout  back  in  July  2003.  Yili's  shares  were  suspended  on  Tuesday,  having  fallen  by  10%  on  Monday.  The  company  and  its  two  main  rivals  -  market  leader  Mengniu  Dairy  and  second  place  Bright  Dairy  -  dominate  a  Chinese  milk  market  that  has  grown  by  almost  30%  over  the  past  five  years.  Analysts  wondered  if  the  scandal  at  Yili  -  the  latest  to  befall  Chinese  companies  this  year  -  could  be  followed  by  further  revelations  of  corporate  wrongdoing.  ""Investors  wonder  if  Yili's  scandal,  one  of  a  slew  to  be  uncovered  this  year,  isn't  just  the  tip  of  the  iceberg,""  said  Chen  Huiqin,  an  analyst  at  Huatai  Securities." 

1	"Stars  shine  on  Bafta  red  carpet  |||    Hollywood  stars  brought  a  touch  of  glamour  to  London  on  Saturday  for  the  biggest  night  in  the  British  film  calendar.  |||    Cate  Blanchett,  Leonardo  DiCaprio  and  Richard  Gere  were  just  some  of  the  actors  who  attended  the  2005  Bafta  film  awards.  They  emerged  from  limos  at  Leicester  Square  to  an  uncertain  British  climate  that  threatened  rain  one  moment  and  promised  late  winter  sunshine  the  next.  But  the  gods  were  certainly  shining  on  the  thousands  of  film  fans  who  lined  the  red  carpet  to  meet  their  idols.  Screaming  built  up  into  a  crescendo  as  more  and  more  big  name  stars  appeared.  The  biggest  cheer  of  the  night  was  reserved  for  The  Aviator  star  Leonardo  DiCaprio,  who  paused  in  the  chilly  February  air  to  sign  autographs  for  the  throngs.  He  said  the  ear-piercing  welcome  was  ""unlike  anything  I've  ever  encountered.  It's  very  intense  and  very  loud.""  |||    Best  actress  winner  Imelda  Staunton,  who  wore  a  green  chiffon  dress  that  sparkled  with  sequins  and  beads,  told  the  BBC  News  website  that  Vera  Drake  was  the  highlight  of  her  career.  Her  role  as  a  backstreet  abortionist  in  the  gritty  low-budget  film  has  already  led  to  a  clutch  of  awards  and  an  Oscar  nomination.  She  said:  ""Never  in  a  million  years  did  I  think  this  was  going  to  happen.  ""Being  here  and  just  being  nominated  is  great,  but  I  hope  it  means  more  people  will  go  and  see  the  film  as  well.""  Rooting  for  Staunton  in  the  best  actress  category  was  Cate  Blanchett,  herself  nominated  for  her  supporting  role  as  Hollywood  icon  Katherine  Hepburn  in  The  Aviator.  |||    Shivering  in  a  floor-length  shimmering  Armani  dress,  the  Australian-born  actress  stopped  to  sign  autographs  and  joked:  ""It's  tight  but  I  love  it.""  Glamour  was  also  brought  to  the  evening  by  actress  Sienna  Miller,  supermodel  Claudia  Schiffer  -  who  was  supporting  her  director  husband  Matthew  Vaughn  -  Troy  actress  Diane  Kruger  and  star  of  the  TV  programme  The  OC,  Micha  Barton.  Wearing  a  caramel-coloured  floaty  frock  by  the  designer  Alexander  McQueen,  Miller  told  reporters  the  red  carpet  experience  was  ""intense,  nerve-wracking  and  cold"".  The  younger  stars  of  British  film  were  also  represented  in  the  shape  of  Emma  Watson,  who  plays  Hermione  in  the  Harry  Potter  films.  The  14-year-old  said  she  was  hoping  to  meet  DiCaprio  and  Keanu  Reeves  but  joked  that  ""they  are  probably  a  little  too  old  for  me"".  |||    Actor  Christian  Slater,  who  is  currently  starring  in  One  Flew  Over  The  Cuckoo's  Nest  in  London's  West  End,  was  greeted  by  cries  of  ""Christian,  Christian""  by  the  ever  vocal  crowd.  Keanu  Reeves,  who  presented  the  best  actress  award,  said  being  on  the  red  carpet  was  an  ""exciting""  part  of  his  job.  ""It  is  always  surreal  and  when  it  is  nice,  it  is  nice,""  he  said.  Martin  Scorsese,  whose  movie  The  Aviator  went  on  to  win  best  film,  said  being  honoured  in  the  UK  meant  a  lot  to  him.  He  said:  ""I  am  a  great  admirer  of  British  cinema  since  the  1930s  and  40s,  up  until  now.  |||    ""They  give  me  a  new  energy  when  I  see  the  best  coming  out  of  England  and  every  two  or  three  years  is  a  whole  new  cycle  of  tough  and  young  film-makers,  and  even  the  older  ones  are  making  good  films.  ""To  recognise  me  in  this  way  is  a  great  honour.""  British  actor  Clive  Owen,  who  has  won  a  Golden  Globe  and  a  Bafta  for  his  supporting  role  in  Closer,  said  it  ""meant  a  lot""  to  be  at  the  ceremony.  He  said:  ""Just  to  be  here  really,  at  the  Baftas.  The  bottom  line  is  it  is  a  celebration  of  British  films.""" 

1	"How  the  Academy  Awards  flourished  |||    The  77th  annual  Academy  Awards  are  taking  place  on  27  February  with  the  stars  of  the  movie-making  world  once  again  holding  their  breath  to  discover  who  will  be  showered  with  the  honours  this  year.  But  from  humble  beginnings,  how  did  the  modern  day  extravaganza  become  the  behemoth  it  is  today?  |||    HOW  IT  ALL  STARTED  The  first  Academy  Awards  were  handed  out  in  1929  at  a  comparatively  low-key  dinner  held  at  the  Hollywood  Roosevelt  Hotel  -  just  over  the  road  from  their  modern  day  home.  |||    Just  250  guests  attended  with  ticket  prices  at  $5.  |||    The  first  film  to  win  was  Wings,  which  starred  Clara  Bow  in  the  only  silent  movie  to  win  the  big  award.  For  the  first  10  years  or  so,  the  winners  list  was  handed  to  the  newspapers  so  they  could  publish  them  at  11pm,  but  in  1940  the  winners  were  published  in  the  Los  Angeles  Times  at  8.45pm  meaning  guests  entering  the  ceremony  knew  already  knew  the  results.  As  a  result  the  sealed  envelope  system  was  introduced,  leading  to  the  secrecy  and  suspense-filled  night  that  happens  today.  WHEN  AND  WHERE  The  tradition  of  holding  the  awards  at  a  banquet  continued  until  1942  but  with  increasing  interest  came  a  growing  guest  list  and  it  became  impractical  to  host  it  as  a  dinner.  |||    The  ceremonies  were  then  transferred  to  theatres  with  the  famous  Grauman's  Chinese  Theatre  the  first  to  host  the  expanded  event.  Other  venues  included  the  Dorothy  Chandler  Pavilion  and  the  Shrine  Auditorium.  They  are  now  held  at  the  Kodak  Theatre,  which  opened  in  2002  just  across  the  road  from  its  original  home  and  holds  6,000  people.  Until  1954  they  were  held  on  a  Thursday,  then  swapped  around  from  Monday  to  Wednesday  before  Sunday  night  was  settled  on,  although  the  month  swapped  from  May  to  April  to  March  and  now  its  current  month  of  February.  The  first  televised  ceremony  was  in  1953,  with  Bob  Hope  as  the  MC.  WHO  WAS  OSCAR?  There  is  no  solid  evidence  as  to  how  the  trophy  became  to  be  known  as  Oscar.  |||    One  popular  story  is  that  Academy  librarian  Margaret  Herrick  said  the  statue  looked  like  her  uncle  Oscar.  A  journalist  apparently  overheard  this  conversation  and  used  the  phrase  in  an  article.  |||    The  first  time  it  is  thought  to  have  been  used  in  print  was  when  columnist  Sidney  Skolsky  used  it  to  describe  Katherine  Hepburn's  first  best  actress  win  in  1934.  The  Academy  officially  adopted  the  nickname  in  1939.  The  trophy  was  designed  by  MGM  art  director  Cedric  Gibbons.  Since  its  inception  2,530  Oscars  have  been  handed  out.  In  support  of  the  war  effort,  the  Academy  handed  out  plaster  Oscar  statuettes  during  WWII.  After  the  war,  winners  exchanged  the  plaster  awards  for  the  real  thing.  Fifty-five  statues  were  stolen  in  en  route  to  the  awards  in  2000,  52  were  recovered  nine  days  later.  Winners  were  unaffected  as  a  new  batch  was  rushed  out.  WHO  SITS  IN  JUDGEMENT?  The  Academy  was  set  up  in  1927  as  a  non-profit  organisation  with  36  members  from  different  film  disciplines.  Douglas  Fairbanks  Sr  was  the  first  president  and  oversaw  the  first  awards.  There  are  now  5,700  members  of  the  Academy  -  with  membership  by  invitation  only  to  those  who  are  seen  to  have  achieved  distinction  in  the  movies  and  are  therefore  seen  as  fit  to  judge  their  peers.  Some  of  the  criteria  for  admittance  includes:  film  credits  that  reflect  the  high  standards  of  the  Academy,  receipt  of  an  Academy  Award  nomination,  achievement  of  unique  distinction,  earning  of  special  merit,  or  making  an  outstanding  contribution  to  film.  THE  STARS  WHO  LEFT  EMPTY-HANDED  While  many  of  the  biggest  films  and  movie-makers  have  been  honoured  by  the  Academy,  there  is  still  surprise  at  those  that  did  not  receive  any  nominations  that  later  went  on  to  become  classics.  |||    Among  the  overlooked  films  were  Hobson's  Choice,  Dirty  Harry,  The  39  Steps,  The  Searchers  and  King  Kong.  Actors  that  failed  to  win  for  their  iconic  roles  included  Al  Jolson  in  the  Jazz  Singer  (1927),  Humphrey  Bogart  in  Casablanca  (1944),  Gene  Kelly  in  Singing  in  the  Rain  (1952)  and  Henry  Fonda  in  12  Angry  Men  (1957).  Alfred  Hitchcock  also  failed  to  win  an  award  despite  five  nominations.  His  enduring  influence  on  the  horror  genre  was  finally  recognised  with  an  honorary  gong  in  1968.  THE  SHOW  ALWAYS  GOES  ON  Not  even  war  has  halted  the  glittering  Hollywood  event.  There  were  calls  for  it  to  be  cancelled  in  2003  during  the  war  in  Iraq,  but  as  it  didn't  stop  during  World  War  II  or  the  Vietnam  war.  |||    Documentary  winner  Michael  Moore  ensured  nobody  forgot  about  the  Iraq  war  though  and  used  his  acceptance  speech  to  criticise  the  American  invasion.  The  ceremony  was  muted  with  the  glitz  turned  down  and  many  female  stars  opting  for  demure  dark  dresses.  The  ceremony  has  been  postponed  on  three  occasions.  Los  Angeles  floods  in  1938  saw  it  put  back  a  week.  The  death  of  Martin  Luther  King  saw  it  postponed  for  two  days  in  1968  as  a  mark  of  respect  and  there  was  a  24-hour  delay  following  the  assassination  attempt  on  President  Ronald  Reagan.  CONTROVERSIES  AND  OTHER  GAFFES  Three  people  have  refused  Oscars,  including  actor  George  C  Scott  who  said  the  whole  thing  was  ""demeaning"".  Writer  Dudley  Nichols  refused  his  Academy  Award  in  1935  for  his  screenplay  for  The  Insider  because  the  Writers'  Guild  was  striking  at  the  time.  Marlon  Brando  turned  down  his  best  actor  Oscar  for  The  Godfather  in  1973  in  protest  as  Hollywood's  apparent  discrimination  against  Native  American  people.  He  sent  along  a  woman  called  Sacheen  Littlefeather  to  collect  his  award.  She  was  later  revealed  to  be  Native  American  actress  Maria  Cruz.  |||    The  following  year  Robert  Opal  interrupted  proceedings  when  he  streaked,  flashing  a  peace  sign  as  well  as  everything  else.  The  TV  network  managed  to  pan  away  and  avoid  too  much  nudity.  Opal  was  murdered  in  1979.  Frank  Capra  was  the  butt  of  one  major  gaffe  in  1934  when  the  host  opened  out  best  picture  envelope  and  declared  ""come  on  up  and  get  it,  Frank""  to  which  Frank  Capra  bounded  up  to  the  stage  before  realising  that  he  had  meant  Frank  Lloyd  had  won  for  Cavalcade.  |||    Capra  vowed  he  would  never  to  go  the  awards  again  but  went  the  following  year  to  collect  his  award  for  It  Happened  One  Night." 

1	"Day-Lewis  set  for  Berlin  honour  |||    Actor  Daniel  Day-Lewis  is  to  be  presented  with  an  award  for  his  career  in  film  at  the  Berlin  Film  Festival.  |||    The  47-year-old,  whose  credits  include  his  Oscar-winning  performance  in  My  Left  Foot,  will  be  presented  with  the  Berlinale  Camera  award  on  15  February.  The  honour,  awarded  since  1986,  honours  figures  in  cinema  that  the  festival  feels  ""particularly  indebted  to"".  Man  to  Man,  a  historical  epic  starring  Kristin  Scott  Thomas,  opens  the  German  festival  on  10  February.  A  candid  documentary  about  the  life  and  career  of  singer  George  Michael,  A  Different  Story  will  also  be  screened  at  the  10-day  event.  '  |||    Day-Lewis  has  competed  four  times  at  the  Berlin  Film  Festival,  with  films  In  The  Name  Of  The  Father  (1994),  The  Crucible  (1997),  The  Boxer  (1998)  and  Martin  Scorsese's  Gangs  Of  New  York  (2003).  The  festival  praises  him  for  his  ""sensational  start""  with  roles  in  My  Beautiful  Launderette  and  costume  classic  A  Room  With  A  View,  and  a  ""great  number  of  celebrated  roles""  in  subsequent  productions.  Japan's  oldest  film  studio  will  also  be  honoured  along  with  Day-Lewis.  Shochiku  film  studios,  which  was  founded  110  years  ago,  will  become  the  first  cinematic  institution  to  receive  the  Berlinale  Camera  award.  Famous  Japanese  directors  including  Akira  Kurosawa  have  had  films  produced  at  the  studio." 

1	"US  TV  special  for  tsunami  relief  |||    A  US  television  network  will  screen  a  celebrity  TV  special  to  benefit  the  tsunami  relief  effort  in  South  Asia.  |||    NBC  will  encourage  viewer  donations  during  an  hour-long  show  featuring  musical  performances  on  15  January.  Actress  Sandra  Bullock  has  donated  $1m  (£525,000)  to  The  American  Red  Cross  and  actor  Leonardo  DiCaprio  pledged  a  ""sizable""  aid  contribution  to  Unicef.  Meanwhile  70  Hong  Kong  music  and  movie  stars  re-recorded  We  Are  the  World  in  Mandarin  and  Cantonese  to  raise  funds.  |||    The  song  will  not  be  released  as  a  single,  but  will  be  played  regularly  during  a  Chinese  telethon  on  Friday  in  aid  of  victims  of  the  Boxing  Day  disaster.  Around  140,000  people  were  killed  and  five  million  left  homeless  or  without  food  and  water  after  an  earthquake  below  the  Indian  Ocean  sent  waves  crashing  into  coastal  communities  in  11  countries.  |||    The  United  Nations  warned  that  the  number  killed  in  the  disaster  could  rise  sharply,  with  aid  yet  to  reach  some  remote  areas.  Performers  have  yet  to  be  confirmed  for  NBC's  aid  relief  benefit  later  this  month.  It  follows  a  two-hour  telethon  carried  by  all  four  major  US  television  networks  10  days  after  the  11  September  terror  attacks  in  2001.  America:  A  Tribute  to  Heroes  raised  more  than  $150m  (£79m)  to  help  victims  of  the  suicide  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Center  and  Pentagon."

The  proposed  deal  was  seen  as  crucial  to  safeguarding  the  future  of  Rover's  Longbridge  plant  in  the  West  Midlands.  However,  there  are  growing  fears  that  the  deal  could  result  in  job  losses.  The  Observer  reported  on  Sunday  that  nearly  half  the  workforce  at  Longbridge  could  be  under  threat  if  the  deal  goes  ahead.  |||    Shanghai  Automotive's  proposed  £1bn  investment  in  Rover  is  awaiting  approval  by  its  owner,  the  Shanghai  city  government  and  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  which  oversees  foreign  investment  by  Chinese  firms.  According  to  the  FT,  the  regulator  has  been  annoyed  by  Rover's  decision  to  talk  publicly  about  the  deal  and  the  intense  speculation  which  has  ensued  about  what  it  will  mean  for  Rover's  future.  As  a  result,  hopes  that  approval  of  the  deal  may  be  fast-tracked  have  disappeared,  the  paper  said.  There  has  been  continued  speculation  about  the  viability  of  Rover's  Longbridge  plant  because  of  falling  sales  and  unfashionable  models.  |||    According  to  the  Observer,  3,000  jobs  -  out  of  a  total  workforce  of  6,500  -  could  be  lost  if  the  deal  goes  ahead.  The  paper  said  that  Chinese  officials  believe  cutbacks  will  be  required  to  keep  the  MG  Rover's  costs  in  line  with  revenues.  It  also  said  that  the  production  of  new  models  through  the  joint  venture  would  take  at  least  eighteen  months.  Neither  Rover  nor  Shanghai  Automotive  commented  on  the  reports." 

2	"Howard  and  Blair  tax  pledge  clash  |||    Tony  Blair  has  said  voters  will  have  to  wait  for  Labour's  manifesto  to  see  if  the  party  has  plans  to  increase  tax.  |||    The  premier  was  responding  to  a  challenge  from  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  who  said  Labour  would  raise  taxes  in  its  post-election  Budget.  Mr  Blair  derided  Tory  claims  they  could  cut  £35bn  in  ""wasteful  spending""  saying  the  party  had  got  its  sums  wrong.  The  two  political  leaders  clashed  just  days  after  the  opening  salvoes  of  the  pre-election  period.  Mr  Howard  told  MPs  that  ""every  independent  expert""  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  to  the  Institute  of  Fiscal  Studies  had  suggested  the  ""government  was  spending  more  than  it  is  raising  and  a  Labour  chancellor  would  have  to  put  up  taxes"".  Mr  Blair  replied:  ""I  think  they  are  wrong  for  this  very  simple  reason:  that  the  Treasury  forecasts  on  the  economy  have  been  proven  right.""  The  Tories  on  Monday  highlighted  their  plans  for  tax  cuts  worth  £4bn,  although  the  specific  taxes  to  be  cut  have  not  been  announced.  |||    They  also  spelled  out  their  plans  for  reduced  government  borrowing  and  more  spending  on  key  services.  Labour  and  the  Liberal  Democrats  have  said  the  party's  sums  do  not  add  up  and  claim  it  would  cut  frontline  services.  But  Mr  Howard  said  voters  faced  a  clear  choice  at  the  next  election  between  more  waste  and  more  tax  under  Labour  and  Tory  value  for  money  and  lower  taxes.  The  Liberal  Democrats  have  also  launched  their  pre-election  platform,  with  leader  Charles  Kennedy  saying  his  party  was  the  ""authentic  opposition"",  particularly  on  the  Iraq  war,  council  tax  and  university  tuition  fees.  Labour  hit  back  at  the  Tory  proposals  even  before  their  publication  with  election  coordinator  Alan  Milburn  accusing  Mr  Howard  of  producing  a  ""fraudulent  prospectus""." 

0	"S  Korea  spending  boost  to  economy  |||    South  Korea  will  boost  state  spending  next  year  in  an  effort  to  create  jobs  and  kick  start  its  sputtering  economy.  |||    It  has  earmarked  100  trillion  won  ($96bn)  for  the  first  six  months  of  2005,  60%  of  its  total  annual  budget.  The  government's  main  problems  are  ""slumping  consumption  and  a  contraction  in  the  construction  industry"".  It  aims  to  create  400,000  jobs  and  will  focus  on  infrastructure  and  home  building,  as  well  as  providing  public  firms  with  money  to  hire  new  workers.  |||    The  government  has  set  an  economic  growth  rate  target  of  5%  for  next  year  and  hinted  that  would  be  in  danger  unless  it  took  action.  ""Internal  and  external  economic  conditions  are  likely  to  remain  unfavourable  in  2005,""  the  Finance  and  Economy  Ministry  said  in  a  statement.  |||    It  blamed  ""continuing  uncertainties  such  as  fluctuating  oil  prices  and  foreign  exchange  rates  and  stagnant  domestic  demand  that  has  shown  few  signs  of  a  quick  rebound"".  In  2004,  growth  will  be  between  4.7%  and  4.8%,  the  ministry  said.  Not  everyone  is  convinced  the  plan  will  work.  ""Our  primary  worry  centres  on  the  what  we  believe  is  the  government's  overly  optimistic  view  that  its  front  loading  of  the  budget  will  be  enough  to  turn  the  economy  around,""  consultancy  4Cast  said  in  a  report.  |||    The  problem  facing  South  Korea  is  that  many  consumers  are  reeling  from  the  effects  of  a  credit  bubble  that  only  recently  burst.  Millions  of  South  Koreans  are  defaulting  on  their  credit  card  bills,  and  the  country's  biggest  card  lender  has  been  hovering  on  the  verge  of  bankruptcy  for  months.  As  part  of  its  spending  plans,  the  government  said  it  will  ask  firms  to  ""roll  over  mortgage  loans  that  come  due  in  the  first  half  of  2005""  .  It  also  pledged  to  look  at  ways  of  helping  families  on  low  incomes.  |||    The  government  voiced  concern  about  the  effect  of  redundancies  in  the  building  trade.  ""Given  the  economic  spill  over  and  employment  effect  in  the  construction  sector,  a  sharp  downturn  in  the  construction  industry  could  have  other  adverse  effects,""  the  ministry  said.  |||    As  a  result,  South  Korea  will  give  private  companies  also  will  be  given  the  chance  to  build  schools,  hospitals,  houses  and  other  public  buildings.  It  also  will  look  at  real  estate  tax  system.  Other  plans  on  the  table  include  promoting  new  industries  such  as  bio-technology  and  nano-technology,  as  well  as  offering  increased  support  to  small  and  medium  sized  businesses.  ""The  focus  will  be  on  job  creation  and  economic  recovery,  given  that  unfavourable  domestic  and  global  conditions  are  likely  to  dog  the  Korean  economy  in  2005,""  the  ministry  said." 

2	"Assembly  ballot  papers  'missing'  |||    Hundreds  of  ballot  papers  for  the  regional  assembly  referendum  in  the  North  East  have  ""disappeared"".  |||    Royal  Mail  says  it  is  investigating  the  situation,  which  has  meant  about  300  homes  in  County  Durham  are  not  receiving  voting  packs.  Officials  at  Darlington  Council  are  now  in  a  race  against  time  to  try  and  rectify  the  situation.  The  all-postal  votes  of  about  two  million  electors  are  due  to  be  handed  in  by  4  November.  A  spokesman  for  Darlington  Council  said:  ""We  have  sent  out  the  ballot  papers,  the  problem  is  with  Royal  Mail.  ""Somewhere  along  the  line,  something  has  gone  wrong  and  these  ballot  papers  have  not  been  delivered.  ""The  Royal  Mail  is  investigating  to  see  if  they  can  find  out  what  the  problem  is.""  |||    A  spokeswoman  for  Royal  Mail  said:  ""We  are  investigating  a  problem  with  the  delivery  route  in  the  Mowden  area  of  Darlington.  ""This  is  affecting  several  hundred  properties,  which  have  failed  to  receive  ballot  papers.  ""We  are  working  closely  with  the  council  and  will  do  all  we  can  to  help  rectify  the  problem.

""We  then  made  further  investigations  and  it  became  clear  this  was  a  bigger  issue.""  A  spokeswoman  for  the  Electoral  Commission  told  BBC  News  Online  that  letters  were  being  sent  out  to  those  homes  affected.  She  said  the  commission  was  satisfied  that  measures  had  been  put  in  place  to  ensure  all  voters  received  ballot  papers  in  time.  So  far  a  total  of  569,072  ballot  envelopes  have  been  scanned  by  bar  code  at  counting  offices  across  the  North  East."

The  first  charge  relates  to  his  failure  to  leave  the  field  promptly,  pushing  referee  Alan  Wiley  and  remonstrating  with  assistant  referee  Paul  Norman.  And  the  second  charge  is  for  using  threatening  words  and/or  behaviour  to  a  match  official  during  the  1-1  draw.  |||    Paolo  di  Canio  was  given  a  seven-match  suspension  when  he  pushed  referee  Paul  Alcock  over  in  a  Premiership  game  between  Sheffield  Wednesday  and  Arsenal  in  1998.  Prutton  will  be  joined  at  Wednesday's  hearing  by  Saints  boss  Harry  Redknapp,  who  believes  that  the  FA  will  throw  the  book  at  his  player.  Redknapp  himself  sprinted  along  the  touchline  to  help  physio  Jim  Joyce  and  coach  Denis  Rofe  shepherd  the  enraged  Prutton  away  from  referee's  assistant  Norman.  ""David  has  made  a  big  mistake  and  he  knows  it.  I  can't  condone  what  he's  done.  He  was  out  of  order  but  he  knows  that,""  said  Redknapp.  ""He's  a  decent  lad.  He  over-reacted  badly  for  some  reason  -  he  had  a  rush  of  blood  from  somewhere.  Off  the  pitch  you  couldn't  meet  a  nicer  lad.""  Prutton  has  apologised  publicly  for  his  actions  and  to  Arsenal's  Robert  Pires,  who  was  injured  in  a  wild  tackle  by  the  Saints'  midfield  man.  |||    He  said:  ""It's  an  horrendous  situation.  I  apologise  to  the  ref  and  linesman,  who  were  only  doing  their  job.  ""I've  also  seen  what  happened  to  Pires'  leg  and  I'm  sorry  for  that  as  well.""  ""I  apologise  for  the  people  who  saw  it.  I  know  you  get  lots  of  kids  going  to  the  match  now  and  they  don't  pay  money  to  see  that  sort  of  thing.  ""It's  not  a  cop-out,  but  it  was  all  a  bit  of  a  blur.  Sometimes  you  react  and  it's  beyond  your  control,  ""  added  Prutton."

Steps  being  considered  include  listing  Ferrari  and  bringing  Maserati  and  Alfa  Romeo  closer  together,  it  said.  Despite  strong  sales  of  Alfa  Romeo,  Fiat's  car  business  is  making  a  loss.  |||    Under  the  proposals  -  which  the  paper  said  could  be  announced  within  days  -  the  iconic  sportscar  maker  could  be  listed  separately  on  the  market.  Fiat  owns  a  56%  stake  in  Ferrari  -best  known  for  its  dominant  Formula  One  motor  racing  team  -  having  first  bought  into  the  business  in  1969.  It  considered  floating  Ferrari  in  2002  but  opted  to  sell  a  minority  stake  to  Italian  bank  Mediobanca  for  775m  euros  ($1bn).  That  sale  valued  Ferrari  -  which  owns  the  Maserati  brand  -  at  2.3bn  euros.  The  price  tag  would  change  if  Maserati  was  stripped  out.  The  Financial  Times  said  Fiat  may  transfer  Maserati  within  its  wholly-  owned  Alfa  Romeo  division  in  an  effort  to  exploit  commercial  synergies.  Such  a  move  would  help  Alfa  Romeo  and  Maserati  to  share  marketing,  distribution  and  research  &  development  costs.  Maserati  and  Ferrari  sell  about  10,000  cars  between  them  and  both  companies  broke  even  in  2003.  |||    Fiat,  Italy's  largest  private  sector  employer,  did  not  comment  on  the  reported  changes.  Fiat  recently  negotiated  an  end  to  its  alliance  with  General  Motors.  The  US  firm  agreed  to  pay  $2bn  to  exit  an  agreement  under  which  it  could  have  been  liable  to  buy  Fiat  outright.  Analysts  said  the  reported  restructuring  was  evidence  of  the  greater  flexibility  which  Fiat  now  had  to  develop  the  business." 

2	"Protesters  plan  airport  challenge  |||    Campaigners  against  the  expansion  of  Britain's  airports  have  begun  challenging  the  government's  plans  in  the  High  Court.  |||    BAA's  expansion  of  Stansted  Airport  in  Essex  by  building  an  extra  runway  is  one  of  the  most  fiercely  opposed  plans.  Opponents  say  the  £2bn  cost  of  the  new  runway  could  not  be  met  unless  cash  from  Heathrow  and  Gatwick  was  used.  They  said  this  is  illegal  under  current  rules  and  are  trying  to  block  the  government  from  changing  legislation.  BAA  are  also  owners  of  the  airports  at  Heathrow  and  Gatwick.  They  have  said  they  cannot  raise  the  money  needed  for  the  Stansted  upgrades  from  current  landing  charges.  BAA  also  says  it  has  attempted  to  involve  communities  in  any  future  airport  plans.  |||    Groups  challenging  the  plans  include  Stop  Stansted  Expansion,  Heathrow  anti-noise  campaigners  HACAN  Clearskies  and  the  London  boroughs  of  Hillingdon  and  Wandsworth.  Their  opponents  are  also  likely  to  complain  there  was  no  public  consultation  before  an  extra  runway  was  built  at  Luton  Airport,  or  when  it  changed  take-off  and  landing  procedures  at  Heathrow.  If  the  group  wins,  the  government's  future  aviation  plans  outlined  in  last  year's  transport  White  Paper  could  be  left  in  ruins.  |||    The  campaigners  will  say  the  government  did  not  adequately  consider  the  building  of  new  airports,  such  as  one  planned  for  the  Isle  of  Sheppey  east  of  London.  Lord  Hanningfield,  leader  of  Essex  County  Council,  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""We  are  going  to  the  High  Court  because  we  want  a  judge  to  rule  there  should  be  a  proper  inquiry.  ""We  want  a  judge  to  say  there  has  been  inadequate  preparation,  consultation  and  thought  before  the  government  came  out  with  its  Green  Paper.  ""Then  there  could  be  a  proper  debate  nationally  about  where  this  extra  capacity  should  go.""  He  added:  ""Politicians  should  not  decide  where  runways  should  be.""  The  Stansted  expansion,  apart  from  the  building  of  the  new  runway,  would  also  need  to  include  new  terminal  buildings  to  deal  with  the  projected  50m  passengers  who  will  use  it  every  year.  |||    The  airport  is  the  hub  of  many  of  the  no-frills  airlines  operating  in  the  UK.  But  BAA  has  said  it  has  attempted  to  involve  communities  in  any  future  airport  plans.  At  Heathrow,  Gatwick,  Edinburgh  and  Glasgow  airports,  BAA  launched  a  series  of  consultations  on  blight  to  properties  from  the  proposed  expansion  in  September  2004,  which  will  close  next  week.  BAA  is  also  offering  to  buy  noise-hit  properties  for  an  index-linked,  unblighted  price.  At  Heathrow,  BAA  said  it  was  working  closely  with  all  interested  parties  to  see  how  the  strict  environmental,  air  quality  and  noise  targets  for  a  third  runway  can  be  met.  At  Gatwick,  the  company  has  written  to  homes  and  business  likely  to  be  affected  by  any  extra  runway."

Profit  growth  in  the  insurance  market  has  not  matched  expansion  at  Citigroup's  other  businesses.  For  Metlife,  the  US's  leading  insurance  company,  the  purchase  gives  it  access  to  a  much  larger  distribution  network.  |||    Robert  Benmosche,  Metlife's  chairman  and  chief  executive,  said  that  it  was  a  ""great  opportunity  for  the  brand  of  Metlife  to  be  distributed  through  Citigroup"".  Under  the  agreement,  Metlife  will  be  able  to  sell  its  products  through  Citigroup  over  the  next  10  years.  The  deal  includes  Smith  Barney  retail  brokerages  and  Citibank  branches.  The  company  will  pay  between  $1bn  and  $3bn  in  Metlife  stock  with  the  rest  being  made  up  of  cash.  Travelers  had  sales  of  $5.2bn  in  2004  and  made  a  profit  of  $901m.  It  has  total  net  assets  of  $96bn.  ""This  deal  employs  some  of  Metlife's  excess  capital  in  a  potentially  higher-return  business  and  gives  it  more  distribution,""  said  Stuart  Quint,  an  analyst  at  Gartmore." 

0	"China  had  role  in  Yukos  split-up  |||    China  lent  Russia  $6bn  (£3.2bn)  to  help  the  Russian  government  renationalise  the  key  Yuganskneftegas  unit  of  oil  group  Yukos,  it  has  been  revealed.  |||    The  Kremlin  said  on  Tuesday  that  the  $6bn  which  Russian  state  bank  VEB  lent  state-owned  Rosneft  to  help  buy  Yugansk  in  turn  came  from  Chinese  banks.  The  revelation  came  as  the  Russian  government  said  Rosneft  had  signed  a  long-term  oil  supply  deal  with  China.  The  deal  sees  Rosneft  receive  $6bn  in  credits  from  China's  CNPC.  |||    According  to  Russian  newspaper  Vedomosti,  these  credits  would  be  used  to  pay  off  the  loans  Rosneft  received  to  finance  the  purchase  of  Yugansk.  Reports  said  CNPC  had  been  offered  20%  of  Yugansk  in  return  for  providing  finance  but  the  company  opted  for  a  long-term  oil  supply  deal  instead.  Analysts  said  one  factor  that  might  have  influenced  the  Chinese  decision  was  the  possibility  of  litigation  from  Yukos,  Yugansk's  former  owner,  if  CNPC  had  become  a  shareholder.  Rosneft  and  VEB  declined  to  comment.  ""The  two  companies  [Rosneft  and  CNPC]  have  agreed  on  the  pre-payment  for  long-term  deliveries,""  said  Russian  oil  official  Sergei  Oganesyan.  ""There  is  nothing  unusual  that  the  pre-payment  is  for  five  to  six  years.""  |||    The  announcements  help  to  explain  how  Rosneft,  a  medium-sized,  indebted,  and  relatively  unknown  firm,  was  able  to  finance  its  surprise  purchase  of  Yugansk.  Yugansk  was  sold  for  $9.3bn  in  an  auction  last  year  to  help  Yukos  pay  off  part  of  a  $27bn  bill  in  unpaid  taxes  and  fines.  |||    The  embattled  Russian  oil  giant  had  previously  filed  for  bankruptcy  protection  in  a  US  court  in  an  attempt  to  prevent  the  forced  sale  of  its  main  production  arm.  But  Yugansk  was  sold  to  a  little  known  shell  company  which  in  turn  was  bought  by  Rosneft.  Yukos  claims  its  downfall  was  punishment  for  the  political  ambitions  of  its  founder  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky.  Once  the  country's  richest  man,  Mr  Khodorkovsky  is  on  trial  for  fraud  and  tax  evasion.  |||    The  deal  between  Rosneft  and  CNPC  is  seen  as  part  of  China's  desire  to  secure  long-term  oil  supplies  to  feed  its  booming  economy.  China's  thirst  for  products  such  as  crude  oil,  copper  and  steel  has  helped  pushed  global  commodity  prices  to  record  levels.  ""Clearly  the  Chinese  are  trying  to  get  some  leverage  [in  Russia],""  said  Dmitry  Lukashov,  an  analyst  at  brokerage  Aton.  ""They  understand  property  rights  in  Russia  are  not  the  most  important  rights,  and  they  are  more  interested  in  guaranteeing  supplies.""  ""If  the  price  of  oil  is  fixed  under  the  deal,  which  is  unlikely,  it  could  be  very  profitable  for  the  Chinese,""  Mr  Lukashov  continued.  ""And  Rosneft  is  in  desperate  need  of  cash,  so  it's  a  good  deal  for  them  too."""

3	"Parmar  ruled  out  of  Davis  Cup  tie  |||    A  knee  injury  has  forced  Arvind  Parmar  out  of  Great  Britain's  Davis  Cup  tie  in  Israel  and  left  Alex  Bogdanovic  in  line  to  take  the  second  singles  place.  |||    Parmar  picked  up  the  injury  last  week  and  has  failed  to  recover  in  time  for  the  Europe/Africa  Zone  I  tie,  which  begins  in  Tel  Aviv  on  Friday.  Bogdanovic  looks  set  to  take  the  second  singles  place  alongside  Greg  Rusedski.  GB  captain  Jeremy  Bates  could  use  17-year-old  Andrew  Murray  and  David  Sherwood  in  the  doubles  rubber.  Bogdanovic  and  Murray  both  pulled  out  of  tournaments  last  week  through  injury  but  are  expected  to  be  fit.  Jamie  Delgado  and  Lee  Childs  have  been  called  into  the  squad  in  Tel  Aviv  as  designated  hitters  for  team  practice  but  Bates  has  no  plans  to  call  either  of  them  into  his  squad  at  present.  |||    The  unheralded  Sherwood  was  the  surprise  inclusion  when  the  squad  was  announced  last  week,  and  Bates  said:  ""David  has  earned  his  place  in  this  squad  on  the  merit  of  his  form  and  results  over  the  last  12  months.""  The  6ft  4in  Sherwood  is  ranked  264th  in  the  world  and  the  LTA  have  high  hopes  for  him  after  Futures  tournament  wins  in  Wrexham  and  Edinburgh.  |||    The  Sheffield-born  right-hander,  aged  24,  also  reached  another  final  in  Plaisir,  France,  a  week  after  making  the  semi-final  in  Mulhouse.  Bates  is  glad  to  have  Rusedski  available  after  Tim  Henman's  retirement  from  Davis  Cup  tennis.  ""His  wealth  of  experience  is  invaluable,  particularly  to  the  younger  players  and  I  know  he  will  lead  by  example,""  Bates  said.  ""We  are  looking  forward  to  the  tie.

Some  63%  of  respondents  in  the  Sunday  Times  poll  thought  his  former  lover  -  Kimberly  Quinn  -  acted  vindictively  and  61%  that  he  had  been  right  to  resign.  YouGov  polled  a  weighted  sample  of  1,981  voters  online  on  16-18  December.  Mr  Blunkett  resigned  as  Home  Secretary  on  Wednesday  after  an  inquiry  uncovered  an  e-mail  showing  a  visa  application  by  Mrs  Quinn's  former  nanny  had  been  speeded  up.  Sir  Alan  Budd's  inquiry  also  found  Mr  Blunkett's  account  of  events  had  been  wrong.  Almost  a  quarter  (21%)  of  those  polled  for  the  Sunday  Times  said  he  should  return  to  the  Cabinet  straight  after  the  election.  One  in  four  said  he  should  be  back  in  the  Government's  top  ranks  within  a  year  or  two  while  39%  opposed  a  comeback.  |||    Three-quarters  said  Mr  Blunkett  was  right  to  go  to  court  for  the  right  to  see  Mrs  Quinn's  son  -  whom  he  says  he  fathered  -  and  just  14%  voiced  sympathy  for  Mrs  Quinn.  A  total  of  53%  of  those  polled  said  they  had  sympathy  for  Mr  Blunkett,  with  40%  saying  they  did  not.  Forty-three  per  cent  thought  Mr  Blunkett  had  done  a  good  job  as  home  secretary  and  17%  disagreed.  Meantime,  32%  said  Mr  Blair  was  a  good  prime  minister  and  38%  disagreed.  A  majority,  52%,  said  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  had  done  a  good  job  and  just  16%  disagreed.  |||    A  second  poll  for  the  Independent  on  Sunday  found  that  support  for  all  political  parties  remained  largely  unchanged  after  the  Blunkett  controversy.

In  contrast,  he  said,  the  popularity  of  van-style  seven-seat  vehicles  and  traditional  saloon  cars  would  fade.  ""Customers  are  moving  out  of  the  mini-van  (and)  traditional  concepts  are  not  as  attractive  anymore,""  he  said.  ""We  have  decided  that  BMW  will  enter  the  [crossover]  segment,""  he  said  in  the  clearest  indication  yet  about  the  car  maker's  intentions.  |||    Mr  Panke  praised  the  Honda  Accura  as  the  ""best  execution""  yet  of  a  crossover  vehicle.  ""We  have  decided  that  the  BMW  brand  will  enter  the  segment,""  he  said.  |||    A  decision  on  just  how  BMW  will  manage  its  entry  into  the  new  market  is  due  in  the  first  half  of  2005.  Typically  it  takes  about  three  years  from  when  a  decision  is  taken  before  a  new  model  hits  the  streets,  Mr  Panke  said,  implying  that  a  BMW  crossover  could  be  on  the  market  by  2008.  The  coming  switch  is  driven  in  part  by  the  need  for  successful  carmakers  to  stay  aware  of  trans-Atlantic  differences  in  the  car  market,  Mr  Panke  insisted.  While  in  the  US  drivers  tend  to  prefer  sports  utility  vehicles  (SUVs),  such  as  the  BMW  X5  and  its  sibling  X3,  in  Europe  demand  for  crossover  vehicles  is  likely  to  be  considerable,  Mr  Panke  said.

2	"Falconer  rebuts  'charade'  claims  |||    Concessions  on  a  bill  which  critics  claim  would  allow  euthanasia  ""through  the  back  door""  were  not  a  political  ploy,  the  lord  chancellor  has  said.  |||    Ministers  have  been  accused  of  panic  in  offering  last  minute  changes  to  the  Mental  Capacity  Bill  amid  chaotic  scenes  in  the  Commons  on  Tuesday.  Lord  Falconer  said  it  was  fair  to  criticise  the  late  timing  of  the  offer.  He  said  the  changes  provided  a  solution  to  a  very  difficult  issue  but  some  MPs  argue  the  situation  is  still  unclear.  |||    The  bill  allows  people  to  give  somebody  the  power  of  attorney  to  make  decisions  on  their  behalf  if  they  become  too  ill  to  decide  for  themselves.  Ministers  insist  the  plans  would  not  change  laws  on  euthanasia  and  would  improve  safeguards.  Critics  fear  it  could  allow  ""killing  by  omission""  through  withdrawing  treatment,  including  food  and  fluids.  |||    Tony  Blair  said  he  would  do  everything  he  could  to  meet  concerns  about  the  bill.  But  changes  to  the  bill  must  not  overturn  the  law  set  when  a  court  ruled  that  doctors  could  withdraw  artificial  feeding  and  hydration  from  Hillsborough  coma  victim  Tony  Bland.  ""It  is  important  we  don't  end  up  in  the  situation  where  doctors  and  consultants  are  confused  about  the  law  and  may  lay  themselves  open  to  prosecution  in  circumstances  where  no  sensible  person  would  want  that  to  happen,""  he  said.  |||    On  Tuesday,  the  government  saw  off  a  backbench  attempt  to  force  changes  to  the  bill  by  297  votes  to  203,  despite  rebellion  by  34  Labour  MPs.  The  revolt  was  also  reduced  by  news  that  Lord  Falconer  had  promised  the  Catholic  archbishop  of  Cardiff  to  strengthen  safeguards  in  the  bill.  But  that  only  came  after  MPs  bombarded  Constitutional  Affairs  Minister  David  Lammy  with  a  barrage  of  requests  for  him  to  read  the  letter  as  they  complained  they  had  been  left  in  the  dark.  Eventually,  he  was  hurriedly  handed  the  letter  to  read  out  five  minutes  before  the  crunch  votes,  prompting  claims  of  a  shambles.  The  deputy  speaker  later  said  the  debate  had  not  been  handled  as  it  should  have  been.  |||    Lord  Falconer  says  there  will  be  amendments  when  the  bill  goes  to  the  House  of  Lords.  He  told  BBC  News:  ""We  have  given  a  commitment  to  put  into  the  bill  a  clause  that  says  that  nothing  in  the  bill  authorises  any  act  where  the  motive  of  the  person  authorising  the  decision  is  to  end  life.  ""The  motive  has  got  to  be  to  end  suffering.""  He  denied  the  concessions  were  a  ""political  manoeuvre""  forced  by  panic  about  the  rebellion.  It  was  inevitable  that  minds  became  more  focused  as  the  bill  went  through  Parliament  but  the  result  was  a  ""sensible  solution"",  he  said.  ""I  don't  think  it  is  something  to  be  embarrassed  about.  These  issues  are  not  easy  to  deal  with,""  he  went  on.  BBC  political  editor  Andrew  Marr  said  Mr  Lammy  was  ""waste  deep  in  quicksand  and  sinking  fast""  after  his  performance.  But  Lord  Falconer  praised  his  minister  for  an  ""excellent  job"".  Former  Conservative  leader  Iain  Duncan  Smith,  one  of  the  chief  critics  of  the  plans,  condemned  the  debate  as  a  ""charade""  and  complained  the  promises  of  changes  to  the  bill  were  vague." 

1	"God  cut  from  Dark  Materials  film  |||    The  director  and  screenwriter  of  the  film  adaptation  of  Philip  Pullman's  His  Dark  Materials  is  to  remove  references  to  God  and  the  church  in  the  movie.  |||    Chris  Weitz,  director  of  About  a  Boy,  said  the  changes  were  being  made  after  film  studio  New  Line  expressed  concern.  The  books  tell  of  a  battle  against  the  church  and  a  fight  to  overthrow  God.  ""They  have  expressed  worry  about  the  possibility  of  perceived  anti-religiosity,""  Weitz  told  a  His  Dark  Materials  fans'  website.  Pullman's  trilogy  has  been  attacked  by  some  Christian  teachers  and  by  the  Catholic  press  as  blasphemy.  Weitz,  who  admitted  he  would  not  be  many  people's  first  choice  to  direct  the  films,  said  he  regarded  the  film  adaptation  as  ""the  most  important  work  of  my  life"".  |||    ""In  part  because  it  is  one  of  the  few  books  to  have  changed  my  life,""  he  told  bridgetothestars.net.  The  award-winning  trilogy  -  Northern  Lights,  The  Subtle  Knife  and  The  Amber  Spyglass  -  tell  the  story  of  Oxford  school  child  Lyra  Belacqua.  She  is  drawn  into  an  epic  struggle  against  the  Church,  which  has  been  carrying  out  experiments  on  children  in  an  attempt  to  remove  original  sin.  |||    As  the  books  progress  the  struggle  turns  into  a  battle  to  overthrow  the  Authority,  a  figure  who  is  God-like  in  the  books.  Weitz,  who  directed  American  Pie  and  About  A  Boy,  said  New  Line  feared  that  any  anti-religiosity  in  the  film  would  make  the  project  ""unviable  financially"".  He  said:  ""All  my  best  efforts  will  be  directed  towards  keeping  the  film  as  liberating  and  iconoclastic  an  experience  as  I  can.  ""But  there  may  be  some  modification  of  terms.""  |||    Weitz  said  he  had  visited  Pullman,  who  had  told  him  that  the  Authority  could  ""represent  any  arbitrary  establishment  that  curtails  the  freedom  of  the  individual,  whether  it  be  religious,  political,  totalitarian,  fundamentalist,  communist,  what  have  you"".  He  added:  ""I  have  no  desire  to  change  the  nature  or  intentions  of  the  villains  of  the  piece,  but  they  may  appear  in  more  subtle  guises.""  There  are  a  number  of  Christian  websites  which  attack  the  trilogy  for  their  depiction  of  the  church  and  of  God,  but  Pullman  has  denied  his  books  are  anti-religious.  His  agent  told  the  Times  newspaper  that  Pullman  was  happy  with  the  adaptation  so  far.  ""Of  course  New  Line  want  to  make  money,  but  Mr  Weitz  is  a  wonderful  director  and  Philip  is  very  supportive.  ""You  have  to  recognise  that  it  is  a  challenge  in  the  climate  of  Bush's  America,"""

Barclays  has  declined  to  comment  on  the  report  in  the  Sunday  Express,  saying  it  does  not  respond  to  market  speculation.  The  two  banks  reportedly  held  talks  in  October  and  November  2004.  |||    Barclays  shares  were  up  8  pence,  or  1.3%,  at  605  pence  by  late  morning  in  London  on  Monday,  making  it  the  second  biggest  gainer  in  the  FTSE  100  index.  UK  banking  icon  Barclays  was  founded  more  than  300  years  ago;  it  has  operations  in  over  60  countries  and  employs  76,200  staff  worldwide.  Its  North  American  divisions  focus  on  business  banking,  whereas  Wells  Fargo  operates  retail  and  business  banking  services  from  6,000  branches.  In  2003,  Barclays  reported  a  20%  rise  in  pre-tax  profits  to  £3.8bn,  and  it  has  recently  forecast  similar  gains  in  2004,  predicting  that  full  year  pre-tax  profits  would  rise  18%  to  £4.5bn.  Wells  Fargo  had  net  income  of  $6.2bn  in  its  last  financial  year,  a  9%  increase  on  the  previous  year,  and  revenues  of  $28.4bn.  Barclays  was  the  focus  of  takeover  speculation  in  August,  when  it  was  linked  to  Citigroup,  though  no  bid  has  ever  materialised.  Stock  market  traders  were  sceptical  that  the  latest  reports  heralded  a  deal.  ""The  chief  executive  would  be  abandoning  his  duty  if  he  didn't  talk  to  rivals,  but  a  deal  doesn't  seem  likely,""  Reuters  quoted  one  trader  as  saying."

And  Wenger  said:  ""At  the  beginning  of  the  season  you  would  expect  them  to  be  fighting  for  the  top  four.  ""I  don't  know  how  they  got  to  be  where  they  are.

And  Wenger  added:  ""The  best  way  to  prepare  for  a  game  is  to  win  the  previous  one.  We  will  go  to  Newcastle  in  good  shape.  ""Fatigue  won't  play  too  big  a  part  in  the  next  few  weeks  as  we  have  players  coming  back  so  I  can  rotate  a  bit  more.  ""We  do  not  play  a  season  with  11  players  and  I  believe  that  all  of  our  squad  deserve  a  chance  in  the  team.""  Striker  Thierry  Henry,  along  with  Robert  Pires,  scored  against  Fulham.  And  Henry  afterwards  described  the  display  as  ""beautiful  to  watch"".  He  said:  ""What  matters  is  winning  and  the  three  points,  of  course.  That  is  the  only  thing  that  really  matters.  But  it  is  more  enjoyable  when  you  play  like  we  did  against  Fulham.  ""We  are  playing  as  a  team  and  that  is  important  because  there  were  some  games  when  we  maybe  were  not  there  as  a  team  and  suffered  for  that.  Those  were  games  we  lost."""

MCI's  directors  have  backed  Verizon,  despite  it  tabling  less  money.  They  are  accused  of  breaching  their  fiduciary  duties  by  depriving  MCI  shareholders  ""of  maximum  value"".  |||    According  the  legal  papers  filed  in  a  Delaware  court,  Verizon  is  set  to  pay  an  """"unconscionable,  unfair  and  grossly  inadequate""  sum  for  MCI,  which  was  formerly  known  as  Worldcom.  Qwest  said  on  Wednesday  that  MCI  had  rejected  a  deal  worth  $8bn.  A  number  of  large  MCI  shareholders  expressed  unhappiness  at  the  decision,  saying  that  Verizon's  offer,  made  up  of  cash,  shares  and  dividends,  undervalued  the  company.  Friday's  lawsuit  argues  that  the  Verizon  offer  makes  no  provision  for  future  growth  prospects  and  that  consolidation  in  the  US  phone  industry  will  put  a  premium  on  MCI's  network,  assets  and  clients.  MCI's  directors  have  argued  that  Verizon  is  bigger  than  Qwest,  has  fewer  debts  and  has  built  a  successful  mobile  division.  Chief  executive  Michael  Capellas  spent  last  week  meeting  with  shareholders  in  an  effort  to  win  their  backing.  |||    In  2002,  investors  in  the  then-named  Worldcom  lost  millions  when  the  company  filed  for  bankruptcy  following  an  accounting  scandal.  However,  the  firm  -  now  renamed  MCI  -  has  put  its  operations  in  order  and  emerged  from  bankruptcy  protection  last  April.  It  is  a  long-distance  and  corporate  phone  firm,  and  would  provide  the  buyer  with  access  to  a  global  telecommunications  network  and  a  large  number  of  business-based  subscribers.  MCI  shares  jumped  on  Friday,  hitting  their  highest  level  since  April  2004  amid  speculation  that  it  would  be  the  focus  of  a  bidding  war.  A  takeover  of  MCI  would  be  the  fifth  billion-dollar  telecoms  deal  since  October  as  companies  look  to  cut  costs  and  boost  client  bases.  Earlier  this  month,  SBC  Communications  agreed  to  buy  its  former  parent  and  phone  pioneer  AT&T  for  about  $16bn." 

2	"Nuclear  strike  'key  terror  risk'  |||    The  UK  and  US  must  realise  they  cannot  prevent  all  terror  attacks  and  should  focus  on  making  sure  they  are  not  nuclear  strikes,  says  a  top  academic.  |||    Amitai  Etzioni,  a  key  influence  on  New  Labour  thinking,  says  the  US  emphasis  on  an  ""Axis  of  Evil""  is  misplaced.  The  priority  should  instead  be  on  ""failing  states"",  including  Russia  and  Pakistan,  who  cannot  properly  control  their  nuclear  material,  he  argues.  His  report  demands  a  major  overhaul  of  world  rules  on  nuclear  technology.  |||    Professor  Etzioni  was  a  senior  adviser  to  President  Carter's  White  House  and  is  the  guru  behind  communitarian  ideas  which  influenced  the  development  of  Blairite  Third  Way  politics.  In  a  report  for  the  Foreign  Policy  Centre  think  tank,  he  says  a  nuclear  terrorist  attack  is  the  main  danger  faced  by  many  nations.  |||    ""Attempts  to  defend  against  it  by  hardening  domestic  targets  cannot  work,  nor  can  one  rely  on  pre-emption  by  taking  the  war  to  the  terrorists  before  they  attack,""  he  says.  That  means  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  curb  terrorists'  access  to  nuclear  arms  and  the  materials  used  to  make  them.  ""We  must  recognise  that  we  will  be  unable  to  stop  all  attacks  and  thus  ensure  terrorists  will  not  be  able  to  strike  with  weapons  of  mass  destruction,""  Prof  Etzioni  continues.  |||    He  suggests  so-called  rogue  states  such  as  Iran  and  North  Korea  are  less  of  a  problem  than  ""failed  and  failing  states"",  which  are  more  likely  to  be  a  source  of  nuclear  materials.  He  names  Russia  as  the  ""failing  state""  of  gravest  concern  as  it  has  an  estimated  90%  of  all  fissile  material  outside  America.  And  he  is  also  worried  about  Pakistan  after  one  of  its  top  nuclear  scientists,  Abdul  Qadeer  Khan,  admitted  leaking  nuclear  secrets.  Prof  Etzioni  criticises  the  US  for  overlooking  those  reports,  suggesting  it  was  done  in  return  for  Pakistani  help  in  hunting  Osama  Bin  Laden.  ""This  is  like  letting  a  serial  killer  go  because  he  promised  to  catch  some  jay-walkers,""  he  says.  |||        -  Upgrading  security  at  nuclear  arms  stores  as  a  temporary  measure      -  Creating  a  new  Global  Safety  Authority  to  tackle  nuclear  terrorism,  using  the  intelligence  links  established  in  the  wake  of  11  September  -  backed  by  the  United  Nations'  authority      -  Encouraging,  pressuring  and  using  ""all  available  means""  to  persuade  countries  to  switch  their  highly-enriched  uranium  for  less  dangerous  less-enriched  uranium      -  When  possible,  taking  fissile  material  away  from  failing  states  to  safe  havens  where  it  can  be  blended  down  or  converted      -  Compelling  ""failing  and  rogue  states"",  and  eventually  all  states,  to  destroy  their  nuclear  bombs." 

0	"Survey  confirms  property  slowdown  |||    Government  figures  have  confirmed  a  widely  reported  slowdown  of  the  UK's  housing  market  in  late  2004.  |||    House  prices  were  11.8%  higher  on  the  year  in  the  last  quarter  of  2004,  down  from  16.3%  in  the  July-to-September  quarter,  the  Land  Registry  said.  The  average  house  price  in  England  and  Wales  was  £182,920,  down  from  £187,971  in  July-September.  The  volume  of  sales  between  October  and  December  dropped  by  nearly  a  quarter  from  the  same  period  in  2003.  The  government  figures  are  the  first  official  confirmation  of  falls  in  the  market  at  the  end  of  2004.  Land  Registry  figures  are  less  up  to  date  than  those  of  banks  and  building  societies,  since  they  record  completions  not  mortgage  approvals.  However,  the  figures  are  viewed  as  the  most  accurate  measure  of  house  prices  as  they  include  all  property  transactions,  including  cash  sales.  |||    The  cost  of  buying  a  home  fell  in  seven  out  of  10  regions  between  the  third  and  fourth  quarters  of  2004.  |||    The  biggest  annual  gains  were  made  in  Wales,  where  house  prices  were  up  by  23%  in  the  fourth  quarter.  House  prices  rose  the  slowest  in  Greater  London,  being  up  by  6%.  In  the  capital,  the  volume  of  sales  fell  by  23%  from  36,185  in  2003  to  28,041  for  the  same  period  in  2004.  There  was  also  a  decline  in  the  number  of  million-pound  properties  sold  in  the  capital,  with  436  properties  over  £1m  sold  compared  to  469  for  the  same  period  in  2003.  Although  the  figures  point  to  a  slowdown  in  the  market,  the  most  recent  surveys  from  Nationwide  and  Halifax  have  indicated  the  market  may  be  undergoing  a  revival.  After  registering  falls  at  the  back  end  of  2004,  Halifax  said  house  prices  rose  by  0.8%  in  January  and  Nationwide  reported  a  rise  of  0.4%  in  the  first  month  of  the  year.  Members  of  the  Bank  of  England's  rate-setting  committee  will  make  their  latest  decision  on  interest  rates  on  Thursday." 

0	"No  seasonal  lift  for  house  market  |||    A  swathe  of  figures  have  provided  further  evidence  of  a  slowdown  in  the  UK  property  market.  |||    The  Council  of  Mortgage  Lenders  (CML),  British  Bankers  Association  (BBA)  and  Building  Societies  Association  (BSA)  all  said  mortgage  lending  was  slowing.  CML  figures  showed  gross  lending  fell  by  4%  in  November  as  the  number  of  people  buying  new  homes  fell.  Elsewhere,  the  BBA  added  underlying  mortgage  lending  rose  by  £4m  in  November,  compared  to  October's  £4.29m.  The  CML  said  that  loans  for  new  property  purchases  fell  25%  year-on-year  to  85,000  -  the  lowest  total  seen  since  February  2003.  |||    Data  from  the  CML  showed  lending  fell  to  just  over  £25bn  in  November,  from  £25.5bn  a  year  earlier.  Separate  figures  from  the  Building  Societies  Association  showed  the  value  of  mortgage  approvals  --  loans  agreed  but  not  yet  made  --  stood  32%  lower  than  at  the  same  time  last  year,  at  a  seasonally-adjusted  £2.98bn.  The  figures  come  hot  on  the  heels  of  new  data  from  property  website  Rightmove  which  suggested  owners  must  indulge  in  a  ""winter  sale""  and  slash  prices  by  up  to  8%.  Miles  Shipside,  commercial  director  at  Rightmove,  said  sellers  would  have  to  be  ""more  realistic  with  their  asking  prices""  to  tempt  buyers.  The  average  asking  price  of  a  home  fell  by  more  than  £600  from  £190,329  in  November  to  £189,733  in  December,  while  the  length  of  time  it  takes  to  sell  a  home  rose  to  81  days  from  53  in  the  summer.  |||    Rightmove  said  estate  agents  were  set  to  enter  2005  with  a  third  more  properties  on  their  books  than  a  year  ago.  ""Even  once  the  quieter  holiday  period  is  over,  sellers  will  find  themselves  competing  with  a  lot  of  other  properties  on  the  market.  In  any  business,  excess  supply  and  low  demand  means  one  thing  -  cut  prices,""  Mr  Shipside  said.  |||    ""The  proof  is  that  some  properties  that  have  been  appropriately  discounted  are  selling,  even  in  the  current  market.""  Overall,  asking  prices  have  fallen  3.3%  from  their  July  peaks  as  the  equivalent  of  £6,500  has  been  cut  from  an  average  property.  A  host  of  mortgage  lenders  and  economists  have  predicted  that  property  prices  will  either  fall  or  stagnate  in  2005.  ""What  is  apparent  is  a  picture  of  a  slowing  market,  but  one  that  should  remain  stable  as  we  return  to  more  normal  volumes  of  lending  over  2005  as  a  whole,""  CML  director  general  Michael  Coogan  said.  ""It's  a  fairly  consistent  picture,  showing  that  mortgage  demand  has  fallen  back  again,  which  is  consistent  with  a  continuing  correction  in  the  housing  market,""  Investec  economist  Philip  Shaw  said.  ""However,  the  figures  do  suggest  only  a  modest  weakening,  and  we  stand  by  our  view  that  the  property  market  will  remain  in  the  doldrums  for  some  time,  though  a  collapse  is  still  unlikely.""" 

2	"Immigration  to  be  election  issue  |||    Immigration  and  asylum  have  normally  been  issues  politicians  from  the  big  parties  have  tiptoed  around  at  election  time.  |||    But  no  longer.  Both  Labour  and  the  Tories  have  signalled  their  intention  of  making  them  central  to  their  election  campaigns.  They  have  been  struck  by  the  level  of  concern  amongst  voters  about  the  issues,  with  internal  surveys  showing  they  have  the  potential  to  swing  large  numbers  of  votes.  That  was  also  true  at  the  last  general  election  and  the  issue  did  briefly  become  a  campaigning  issue.  But  it  sparked  the  probably  predictable  furore  with  claims  politicians  were  either  stoking  up  xenophobia  or,  alternatively,  running  scared  of  addressing  the  problem.  But  this  time  around  it  looks  set  to  be  one  of  the  core  battlegrounds  with  both  the  big  parties  competing  to  set  out  tough  policies.  |||    The  Tories  are  already  committed  to  imposing  annual  limits  on  immigration,  with  a  quota  for  asylum  seekers  and  with  applications  processed  outside  the  UK.  Labour  has  already  branded  the  proposal  unworkable  but  party  strategists  have  seen  the  Tories  seizing  a  poll  advantage  over  the  issue.  |||    Now  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  has  come  up  with  alternative  proposals  for  a  points  system  to  ensure  only  immigrants  who  can  benefit  the  economy  will  be  granted  entry,  and  to  kick  out  more  failed  asylum  seekers.  That  has  been  attacked  by  the  Tories  as  too  little,  too  late  and  for  failing  to  tackle  the  key  issue  of  the  numbers  entering  the  UK.  The  Liberal  Democrats  have  not  been  drawn  too  deeply  into  the  argument  but  have  called  for  a  Europe-wide  policy  on  immigration.  |||    But,  while  all  the  parties  appear  to  agree  the  time  has  come  to  properly  debate  and  address  the  issue,  there  are  already  signs  they  will  run  into  precisely  the  same  problems  as  before.  Former  union  leader  Sir  Bill  Morris  has  already  accused  both  the  big  parties  of  engaging  in  a  ""bidding  war  about  who  can  be  nastiest  to  asylum  seekers"".  |||    ""My  concern  is  that,  whilst  the  Labour  Party  and  the  Conservative  Party  will  take  a  constructive  approach  to  the  debate,  right-wing  political  parties,  picking  up  on  statements  like  `burden  to  Britain'  will  exploit  this  and  create  a  lot  of  fear  and  uncertainty"".  It  is  precisely  that  concern  -  and  the  possible  suggestion  the  issue  is  playing  to  the  far  right's  racist  agenda  -  that  will  provoke  strong  reactions  from  many  concerned  with  this  issue.  The  challenge  for  the  big  parties  is  to  ensure  they  can  engage  in  the  debate  during  the  cut  and  thrust  of  a  general  election  while  also  avoiding  that  trap."

Analysts  expect  Jet  to  raise  at  least  16.4bn  rupees  ($375m;  £198m)  from  the  offering.  Interest  in  Jet's  IPO  has  been  fuelled  by  hopes  for  robust  growth  in  India's  air  travel  market.  |||    The  share  offer,  representing  about  20%  of  Jet's  equity,  was  oversubscribed,  news  agency  Reuters  reported.

The  company  has  grown  rapidly  since  it  launched  operations  in  1993,  overtaking  state-owned  flag  carrier  Indian  Airlines.  However,  it  faces  stiff  competition  from  rivals  and  low-cost  carriers.  Jet's  IPO  is  the  first  in  a  series  of  expected  share  offers  from  Indian  companies  this  year,  as  they  move  to  raise  funds  to  help  them  do  business  in  a  rapidly-growing  economy." 

0	"House  prices  show  slight  increase  |||    Prices  of  homes  in  the  UK  rose  a  seasonally  adjusted  0.5%  in  February,  says  the  Nationwide  building  society.  |||    The  figure  means  the  annual  rate  of  increase  in  the  UK  is  down  to  10.2%,  the  lowest  rate  since  June  2001.  The  annual  rate  has  halved  since  August  last  year,  as  interest  rises  have  cooled  the  housing  market.  At  the  same  time,  the  number  of  mortgage  approvals  fell  in  January  to  a  near  10-year  low,  official  Bank  of  England  figures  have  shown.  |||    Nationwide  said  that  in  January  house  prices  went  up  by  0.4%  on  the  month  and  by  12.6%  on  a  year  earlier.  ""We  are  not  seeing  the  market  collapsing  in  the  way  some  had  feared,""  said  Nationwide  economist  Alex  Bannister.  There  have  been  a  number  of  warnings  that  the  UK  housing  market  may  be  heading  for  a  downturn  after  four  years  of  strong  growth  to  2004.  In  November,  Barclays,  which  owns  former  building  society  the  Woolwich,  forecast  an  8%  fall  in  property  prices  in  2005,  followed  by  further  declines  in  2006  and  2007.  And  last  summer,  economists  at  PricewaterhouseCoopers  (PWC)  warned  house  prices  were  overvalued  and  could  fall  by  between  10%  and  15%  by  2009.  |||    The  price  of  an  average  UK  property  now  stands  at  £152,879.  Homeowners  now  expect  house  prices  to  rise  by  1%  over  the  next  six  months,  Mr  Bannister  said.  He  said  if  the  growth  continued  at  this  level  then  the  Bank  of  England  may  increase  interest  rates  from  their  current  4.75%.  |||    ""I  think  the  key  is  what  the  Bank  expects  to  happen  to  the  housing  market.  We  always  thought  we  would  see  a  small  rise,  they  thought  they  would  see  a  small  decline.""  House  prices  have  risen  0.9%  this  year,  Nationwide  said,  and  if  this  pace  of  increase  persists,  prices  would  rise  by  just  under  6%  in  the  year  to  December.  This  is  slightly  above  the  0-5%  range  Nationwide  predicts.  |||    Further  evidence  of  a  slowdown  in  the  housing  market  emerged  from  Bank  of  England  lending  figures  released  on  Tuesday.  New  mortgage  loans  in  January  fell  to  79,000  from  82,000  in  December,  the  bank  said.  The  past  few  months  have  seen  approvals  fall  to  levels  last  seen  in  1995.  The  Bank  revealed  that  48,000  fewer  mortgages  were  approved  in  January  than  for  the  same  month  in  2004.  Overall,  mortgage  lending  rose  by  £7.2bn  in  January,  marginally  up  on  the  £7.1bn  rise  in  December."

But  the  group  said  Barclays  is  still  waiting  for  the  approval  of  South  Africa's  banking  and  competition  authorities  to  make  a  formal  offer.  Absa  also  announced  that  it  expects  to  see  earnings  grow  by  20-25%  in  its  current  financial  year.  |||    ""Discussions  with  Barclays  are  continuing,  but  shareholders  are  advised  that  no  agreement  has  been  reached  as  to  any  offer  being  made  by  Barclays  to  acquire  a  majority  stake  in  Absa,""  Absa  said  in  a  statement.  If  Barclays  buys  a  stake  in  Absa  it  will  be  one  of  the  largest  foreign  investments  in  South  Africa  in  recent  years.  Absa  currently  has  a  market  value  of  about  $8.5bn  (£4.4bn).  Analysts  said  Absa's  earnings  forecast  was  better  than  expected.  However,  the  company  warned  that  headline  earnings  growth  would  be  trimmed  by  about  four  percentage  points  because  of  share  options  for  a  black  economic  empowerment  transaction  and  a  staff  share  incentive  scheme.  The  South  African  group  will  release  its  results  for  the  year  to  31  March  on  30  May."

Qwest  chairman  Richard  Notebaert  sent  a  letter  to  MCI's  board  on  Thursday  saying  that  it  plans  to  submit  a  new  offer  after  examining  Verizon's  bid.  Formerly  known  as  Worldcom,  MCI  is  a  long-distance  and  corporate  phone  firm.  Snapping  up  MCI  would  give  the  buyer  access  to  a  global  telecommunications  network  and  a  large  number  of  business-based  subscribers.  Shares  of  MCI  were  up  more  than  4%  in  electronic  trading  after  the  close  of  New  York  markets.  |||    Qwest  said  on  Wednesday  that  MCI  had  rejected  a  deal  worth  $8bn.  ""We  would  like  to  advise  you  that  once  we  have  completed  our  review  of  the  Verizon  merger  agreement,  we  do  intend  to  submit  a  modified  offer  to  acquire  MCI,""  the  letter  from  Qwest  said.  Verizon's  offer  is  made  up  of  cash,  shares  and  dividends,  and  a  number  of  investors  have  said  that  it  undervalues  MCI.  Verizon  plans  to  swap  0.41  of  its  shares  and  $1.50  in  cash  for  each  MCI  share,  as  well  as  offering  special  dividends  of  $4.50  a  share.  Both  company  boards  have  backed  the  deal,  but  regulators  will  still  need  to  give  their  approval.  As  well  as  trying  to  lure  investors  with  the  promise  of  better  returns,  Qwest  also  reckons  that  its  offer  will  face  less  regulatory  scrutiny  than  Verizon's.  |||    The  takeover  would  be  the  fifth  billion-dollar  telecoms  deal  since  October  as  companies  look  to  cut  costs  and  boost  client  bases.  Earlier  this  month,  SBC  Communications  agreed  to  buy  its  former  parent  and  phone  trailblazer  AT&T  for  about  $16bn.  There  may  be  concerns  other  than  cash,  however,  especially  as  MCI  only  emerged  from  bankruptcy  protection  last  April.  Verizon  is  far  bigger  than  Qwest,  has  fewer  debts  and  has  built  a  successful  mobile  division.  Also,  MCI,  while  trading  under  the  name  Worldcom,  became  the  biggest  corporate  bankruptcy  in  US  history  after  admitting  that  it  illegally  booked  expenses  and  inflated  profits.  Former  Worldcom  boss  Bernie  Ebbers  is  currently  standing  trial,  accused  of  overseeing  an  $11bn  fraud.  Qwest,  meanwhile,  had  to  pay  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  $250m  in  October  to  settle  charges  that  it  massaged  earnings  to  keep  Wall  Street  happy." 

2	"Minimum  wage  increased  to  £5.05  |||    The  minimum  wage  will  rise  in  October,  benefiting  more  than  1m  people,  the  government  has  announced.  |||    Adults  must  be  paid  at  least  £5.05  an  hour,  up  from  £4.85,  while  18  to  21  year  olds  will  be  paid  £4.25.  The  recommendations  came  from  the  Low  Pay  Commission  which  said  the  number  of  jobs  had  continued  to  grow  since  the  minimum  wage  was  introduced  in  1999.  Businesses  wanted  it  frozen,  warning  more  rises  could  damage  competitiveness  but  the  unions  want  a  £6  rate.  |||    A  further  increase  in  the  adult  rate  to  £5.35  an  hour  is  provisionally  scheduled  for  October  2006.  According  to  the  commission,  many  businesses  had  found  the  last  two  significant  increases  in  the  minimum  wage  ""challenging"".  ""We  have  therefore  recommended  only  a  slight  increase  above  average  earnings,  and  concentrated  it  in  the  second  year  to  allow  business  more  time  to  absorb  the  impact,""  said  chairman  Adair  Turner.  The  government  says  most  of  those  on  the  minimum  wage  are  women  -  with  many  working  in  cleaning,  catering,  shops  and  hairdressing.  |||    Unveiling  the  latest  increase,  Mr  Blair  said  he  wanted  the  minimum  wage  to  become  a  ""symbol  of  decency  and  fairness"".  ""For  too  long,  poverty  pay  capped  the  aspiration  and  prosperity  of  far  too  many  hard-working  families,""  he  said.  ""Too  often,  people  were  told  to  make  a  choice  between  the  indignity  of  unemployment  or  the  humiliation  of  poverty  pay.""  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  and  Transport  Secretary  Alistair  Darling  promoted  the  news  in  Edinburgh,  Wales  Secretary  Peter  Hain  and  Welsh  First  Minister  Rhodri  Morgan  in  Cardiff  and  Northern  Ireland  Minister  John  Spellar  in  Belfast.  The  government  has  not  accepted  the  commission's  recommendation  that  21-year-olds  should  be  paid  at  the  adult  rate,  but  says  it  will  look  again  at  the  rate  later  on.  Mr  Brown  said:  ""We  want  to  do  nothing  that  can  damage  the  employment  opportunities  for  young  people,  particularly  young  people  entering  the  labour  market  for  the  first  time.""  The  government  has  said  it  will  look  at  tougher  action  against  the  small  number  of  employers  who  consistently  refuse  to  pay  the  minimum  wage.  |||    The  national  minimum  wage  is  currently  set  at  £4.85  per  hour  for  those  aged  22  and  above,  and  at  £4.10  for  those  aged  18  to  21.  A  £3  per  hour  minimum  wage  was  introduced  last  October  for  16  to  17-year-olds,  but  apprentices  are  exempt.  The  Trade  Unions  Congress  welcomed  the  increase,  but  has  called  for  a  £6  minimum  wage  by  next  year.  But  the  Confederation  of  British  Industry  (CBI)  called  for  a  ""pause  year""  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  above  inflation  rise  in  the  minimum  wage  in  October.  And  David  Frost,  director  of  the  British  Chambers  of  Commerce,  said:  ""The  level  of  increase  each  year  has  increased  by  rates  far  outstripping  the  rates  of  inflation.  ""What  employers  are  saying  to  us  now  is  that  it's  at  a  level  where  it's  starting  to  bite  into  the  competitiveness  of  companies  right  across  the  country.""  |||    The  Liberal  Democrats'  economics  spokesman  Vincent  Cable  said  he  supported  the  move  to  raise  the  minimum  wage.  ""It's  not  just  good  for  the  workers  themselves  but  it  lifts  them  out  of  benefits  and  therefore  is  good  for  the  Exchequer  too,""  he  said.  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard  said  he  accepted  the  principle  of  the  minimum  wage  and  would  not  ""seek  to  disturb""  the  increase.  Speaking  on  BBC  Radio  4's  Woman's  Hour,  Mr  Howard  hinted  the  Tories  might  go  into  the  general  election  with  a  promise  to  cancel  income  tax  for  the  lowest-paid  workers.  ""There  are  people  on  very  low  salaries,  very  low  incomes  indeed  who  really  shouldn't  be  paying  income  tax,""  he  said.  |||    It  would  be  better  to  decrease  taxes  on  earnings  below  £12,000  a  year,  with  say  no  tax  on  below  £6,000.  The  losses  in  tax  can  be  recouped  by  having  a  50pc  tax  band  for  people  making  over  £100,000.  Our  minimum  wage  is  going  to  be  effectively  almost  twice  the  US  minimum  wage,  yet  our  economy  per  person  is  only  2/3rds  of  the  US!  Perhaps,  we  have  to  really  starting  questioning  why  some  products  cost  50-60%  more  here  than  they  do  in  the  US.  This  combined  with  the  tax  decreases  would  make  the  pounds  the  low-paid  people  do  make  go  much  further.  |||    It's  still  not  good  enough!  I  got  a  part  time  Job  at  16  when  I  was  doing  my  A-levels  in  an  attempt  to  get  a  little  money  saved  for  Uni.  This  was  only  2  years  ago  and  I  was  getting  paid  £2.75  an  hour,  and  working  as  hard  as  any  of  the  older  staff,  maybe  it's  about  time  16  -  21  year  olds  got  a  fair  wage!  |||    We  must  remember  that  the  minimum  wage  is  only  part  of  the  picture  and  must  not  rise  to  a  level  that  makes  employing  people  unattractive  and  encourages  businesses  to  send  work  and  therefore  jobs  abroad.  Still  government  and  local  councils  employ  staff  via  their  contractors  that  pay  at  the  minimum  wage  or  very  close  to  it.  An  easy  way  for  the  government  to  do  as  it  preaches  would  be  to  insist  on  floor  pay  levels  for  all  government  workers  and  take  tens  of  thousand  of  civil  servants  out  of  the  social  security  system  all  together.  |||    Any  increase  is  certainly  welcome  news.  However  for  all  those  whining  about  the  pressures  of  an  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  I  would  simply  ask  them:  ""Would  you  be  happy  to  work  for  less  than  £5.05  an  hour?"".  Thought  not  ...  so  then,  don't  expect  others  to  either.  |||    I  can't  believe  that  so  many  of  these  comments  are  against  the  minimum  wage!  Also  I  personally  take  great  offence  at  the  insinuation  that  people  earning  minimum  wage  were  lazy  at  school  if  everyone  went  to  university  then  who  would  serve  you  in  the  supermarkets  and  clean  up  after  you?  It's  about  time  that  these  hardworking  people  are  rewarded  with  only  what  they  deserve  and  have  earned  fair  pay  and  a  bit  of  respect  wouldn't  go  a  miss  either.  br  /&gt;  |||    This  is  good  news.  The  minimum  wage  has  put  a  sense  of  equality  back  into  a  worker's  relationship  with  their  employer.  Wages  are  supposed  to  be  a  fair  reflection  of  an  employee's  efforts.  For  too  long  wages  were  a  point  of  exploitation  -  what  could  an  employer  get  away  with.  In  very  simplistic  terms  this  put  a  pressure  to  keep  low-paid  wages  low.  With  the  minimum  wage  this  downward  pressure  is  at  least  partly  removed.  |||    It  is  also  interesting  to  read  the  comments  from  so  called  business  leaders.  They  are  the  first  to  defend  the  rights  and  privileges  of  boards  to  award  fat-cat  salaries,  bonuses  and  pension  rights  to  the  select  few  but  they  are  the  first  to  attack  policies  that  are  put  in  place  to  merely  defend  the  rights  of  those  that  really  make  those  fat  cats  purr!  |||    I  feel  there  are  both  negatives  and  positives  to  the  increase,  on  one  hand  some  businesses  will  struggle  to  stay  afloat  but  on  the  other  hand  in  today  world  many  young  people  can't  afford  to  move  out  as  property  costs  too  much  and  only  by  earning  more  will  they  be  able  to  get  on  in  life.  Its  true  many  may  get  complacent  but  the  minimum  wage  could  be  looked  at  as  more  of  a  stepping  stone  rather  than  a  hand  out.  |||    Here  come  the  usual  whines  about  how  difficult  it  will  be  for  businesses!  We  all  remember  Michael  Howard's  protestations  that  the  minimum  wage  would  cost  a  million  jobs  when  it  was  introduced  -  funny  how  he's  gone  quiet  on  that  one!  Jobs  have  continued  to  increase  since  this  humane  legislation  was  brought  in.  I  think  if  any  job  is  worth  doing  then  it's  worth  being  paid  a  fair  wage  for,  and  £5.05  is  hardly  a  fortune.  If  your  business  cannot  pay  its  workers  a  decent  wage  then  maybe  it's  not  being  run  properly  and  if  it  folds,  a  better-run  company  will  take  over  its  duties  and  employ  more  people,  so  everybody  wins  except  incompetent  business  owners!  |||    Great  keep  at  it  Tony,  I  remember  the  despair  of  the  80s  and  the  low  wages  employers  got  away  with.  At  last  we  can  make  a  difference  to  people  and  reward  them  for  working.  We  can't  afford  not  to  pay  a  decent  wage.  It's  not  a  jobs  at  any  price  economy,  goodbye  sweatshops  hello  decency.  |||    The  increase  in  minimum  wage  is  a  good  thing.  Living  in  the  southwest  where  house  prices  and  rent  have  increased  hugely  (like  the  rest  of  the  country)  over  the  past  5  years  has  made  living  for  you  average  18-21  years  old  very  difficult.  In  the  south  west  the  increase  in  living  costs  have  not  been  matched  by  an  increase  in  pay,  for  example  a  job  I  did  in  Plymouth  was  underpaid  to  an  equivalent  worker  in  Exeter  by  75p  an  hour.  Hopefully  the  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  will  bring  in  to  balance  pay  on  a  regional  and  national  level,  and  in  turn  allow  people  like  myself  who  do  work  hard,  but  might  never  earn  a  6  figure  salary  the  chance  to  branch  out  on  our  own.  |||    I  work  at  a  large  Hospital  where  the  contractors  providing  all  ancillary  services  -  domestic,  catering  &  portering  etc  -  pay  the  minimum  wage  of  £4.85  as  the  basic  rate.  Someone  has  to  do  these  unglamorous  jobs  and  earn  enough  to  live  decently.  How  dare  people  suggest  we  are  lazy  or  complacent  for  accepting  these  jobs  and  these  wages?  Who  do  they  think  will  be  carrying  out  these  public  service  jobs  if  contractors  are  allowed  to  pay  as  little  as  their  consciences  allow?  |||    This  is  definitely  the  right  step  in  the  right  direction.  It  shows  that  this  government  cares  for  the  low  income  earners  as  well.  This  is  a  million  votes  more.  Good  strategy  isn't  it?  |||    Although  I  would  not  deny  people  the  minimum  wage  increase,  its  timing  stinks.  I  am  quite  prepared  for  a  raft  of  'bribes'  to  come  from  the  government  before  the  election  and  a  raft  of  taxes  afterwards,  they  are  playing  us  for  the  fools  they  think  we  are.  |||    This  is  extremely  bad  news  for  any  business  -  whether  they  are  small  and  medium  enterprises  or  even  large  companies.  By  increasing  overheads,  for  business,  there  will  be  an  almost  certain  rise  in  costs  to  the  consumer  who  while  they  openly  welcome  the  idea  of  an  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  are  the  same  people  who  still  want  to  buy  that  shirt,  or  that  pair  of  trainers  for  next  to  nothing.  The  extra  cost  this  increase  will  bring,  will  only  be  reflected  in  the  price  of  the  goods  we  buy,  which,  in  turn  will  only  serve  to  discourage  companies  from  setting-up  business  in  the  UK,  or  encourage  those  companies  already  based  here  to  look  elsewhere.  The  jubilation  felt  by  ""low-paid""  workers  here  will  soon  give  way  to  misery  as  they  lose  their  jobs.  |||    This  will  only  lead  to  a  reduction  in  jobs.  Why  have  many  of  the  call  centre  jobs  gone  to  India.  Blair  say's  the  economy  is  ""strong  and  stable  economy""  however  consumer  debt  and  the  country's  debt  is  at  its  highest  and  now  they  heap  this  onto  businesses,  that  will  have  no  choice  but  to  cut  the  workforce.  |||    The  timing  cannot  be  coincidental.  This  is  blatant  electioneering  and  should  be  exposed  as  such.  |||    Andrew  in  Derby  complains  that  raising  the  minimum  wage  is  'blatant  electioneering'.  I  don't  mind  if  it  is.  In  our  degraded  democracy,  elections  are  the  one  time  when  elites  really  have  to  worry  about  doing  something  concrete  for  the  majority.  My  only  complaint  is  the  paltry  figures  being  discussed.  If  my  maths  is  right,  a  35  hour  week  at  £5.05  gives  you  an  annual  income  just  over  £9,000  and  raising  it  to  £6  leaves  it  under  £11,000.  The  unions  should  be  putting  the  Government  under  pressure  for  much  more.  Businesses  complaining  might  like  to  take  a  look  at  corporate  pay,  shareholder  payouts  and  profits  before  wondering  if  paying  a  living  wage  is  really  a  controlling  factor  in  the  viability  of  their  firm.  |||    I  am  all  for  lifting  the  minimum  wage  of  workers  to  a  reasonable  level,  but  we  have  to  accept  that  with  this  will  come  competition  from  overseas  workers.  Also  small  businesses  will  have  to  be  able  to  afford  this  manpower  cost.  We  are  already  seeing  a  sweeping  change  in  IT  work  being  lost  to  India  where  people  are  paid  much  less.  It  is  difficult  for  me  to  understand  that  only  five  years  ago  cheap  labour  abroad  was  classified  as  'sweat  shop',  but  now  we  are  told  it  is  global  competition.  With  our  manufacturing  industry  in  serious  decline  the  country  cannot  be  entirely  service  industries  without  something  tangible  to  serve.  There  has  to  be  something  at  the  top  of  the  food  chain  and  that  is  manufacturing.  The  whole  picture  needs  to  be  looked  at.  |||    This  is  great  news,  but  that  might  be  because  I  work  for  minimum  wage.  Seems  a  good  idea  and  will  hopefully  be  an  incentive  to  those  who  live  to  claim  to  actually  get  a  job.  When  you  can  ""earn""  more  from  claiming  than  you  can  from  work,  there  is  no  incentive.  Perhaps  a  step  in  the  right  direction.  |||    If  the  TUC  get  their  way  a  very  large  number  of  SMEs  will  have  to  close  -  this  will  put  more  people  out  of  work.  How  then  will  the  government  fudge  the  unemployment  figures!  The  government  know  it  is  not  big  business  that  keeps  the  economy  going  but  the  SMEs  but  we  always  get  overlooked,  they  will  only  take  notice  if  these  large  corporations  close  and  move  to  other  countries,  after  all  they  are  predominantly  owned  by  foreign  companies.  We  are  a  specialist  company  but  with  these  increases  have  already  had  an  effect  on  us  and  we  have  lost  work  another  one  will  close  us.  |||    While  I'm  delighted  for  those  on  low  pay  that  this  increase  is  being  put  forward,  I  am  extremely  concerned  at  the  implications  for  small  businesses.  As  an  employee  for  a  small  nursery,  I  know  this  increase  will  cause  great  hardship  for  my  employer,  who  has  been  unable  to  increase  salaries  for  higher  paid  employees  because  of  last  October's  increase  for  the  lower  paid  employees  -  who  were  originally  being  paid  slightly  above  the  minimum  but  are  now  on  the  minimum.  This  latest  increase  of  20p  an  hour  will  cause  even  more  financial  hardship.  If  the  rate  rises  to  £6  then  I  can  foresee  many  small  businesses  having  to  pay  off  employees.  |||    The  increase  in  minimum  wage  will  have  a  serious  effect  on  my  business.  Although  we  pay  above  the  minimum  level  we  will  have  to  increase  our  pay  rates  to  maintain  the  differential.  The  raise  is  well  above  inflation  and  without  significant  increases  in  sales,  it  will  mean  that  I  will  not  be  taking  on  a  new  member  of  staff  as  planned  and  I  will  be  looking  to  reduce  the  total  hours  worked  by  the  other  members  of  staff,  overtime  being  the  first  to  go.  |||    I  currently  employ  42  staff  whose  wages  mirror  the  national  minimum  wage.  Increases  above  inflation  are  fine  but  all  of  my  business  is  conducted  with  local  authorities  who  will  not  accept  above  inflation  rises  in  my  service  delivery.  80%  of  my  costs  are  labour.  The  other  aspect  that  is  always  hidden  is  that  the  thresholds  for  tax  credits  do  not  move  in  line  with  these  increases  so  that  all  that  happens  is  that  employees  tax  credit  support  is  reduced  by  the  amount  of  the  increase,  thereby  saving  the  government  money  but  increasing  the  financial  burden  on  small  to  medium  businesses  |||    It  is  very  good  that  the  government  has  decided  to  increase  the  minimum  wage  -  this  should  hopefully  motivate  people  to  undertake  the  ""lower  status""  jobs.  |||    I  know  about  this  great  idea  -  don't  bother  getting  qualifications,  laze  about  at  school,  no  need  to  do  anything  other  than  attend  so  your  parents  don't  get  fined  because  remember,  when  you  do  eventually  start  working,  doesn't  matter  how  lazy  you  are,  you'll  be  guaranteed  a  decent  wage.  The  ones  who  suffer  are  the  employers.  |||    I  hope  that  if  industry  and  business  have  to  pay  this  new  rate  that  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  will  increase  tax  allowances  and  raise  national  insurance  thresholds  so  that  the  treasury  won't  take  some  of  this  increase  off  the  people  they  say  they  are  helping,  or  is  this  just  another  form  of  stealth  tax  on  business  through  the  back  door?  |||    I  don't  believe  in  the  minimum  wage  at  all!  I  think  jobs  should  create  their  own  wage  value  and  that  if  people  want  higher  wages  they  should  earn  them.  Now,  before  everyone  thinks  that  I  am  some  ""rich-kid"",  I  can  assure  you  I  am  not.  I  came  from  a  very  much  working  class  background  and  started  work  20  years  ago  on  a  Youth  Opportunity  Program  earning  £25  per  week.  I  worked  hard,  went  to  college  part  time,  got  my  A-levels  and  degree  &  bettered  myself.  I  now  earn  a  6  figure  salary.  I  did  that  through  hard  work  and  getting  off  my  backside.  A  minimum  wage  just  makes  people  complacent.  |||    To  Ashley,  of  Swindon:  when  you  earned  £25  per  week,  it  was  worth  something.  These  days  that  £25  would  need  to  be  near  to  £60  to  have  the  equivalent  buying  power.  I  might  add,  that  thanks  to  successive  governments  holding  down  the  tax  allowance  threshold  below  inflation,  people  earning  the  minimum  wage  are  paying  taxes  that  they  never  would  have  done  10  years  ago  at  equivalent  wages.  ""In  my  day""  type  arguments  are  a  view  that  belong  in  the  'your  day'  -  20  years  ago!  |||    As  a  graduate  working  for  minimum  wage,  I  welcome  any  increase  of  pay  I  can  get.  I  disagree  with  Ashley,  Swindon  saying  I  have  to  work  harder  to  get  more  pay.  I  have  my  GCSE's  A-Levels  and  A  degree  and  have  chosen  to  work  for  a  small  business  that  can't  afford  the  wages  I  should  be  getting,  I  should  be  on  at  least  3x  what  I'm  getting  but  they  can't  afford  it.  We  all  work  hard  but  the  money  is  just  not  there.  But  on  the  plus  side  I  love  my  job  and  wouldn't  change  it  just  to  get  more  pay.  |||    As  an  employer  of  staff  in  several  shops  the  last  rise  in  the  minimum  wage  cost  my  company  an  additional  £5000  per  year.  These  next  rises  will  cost  me  more.  I  have  to  get  the  money  from  somewhere  so  pass  it  on  to  customers.  So  no  one  really  wins  in  the  end.  |||    In  answer  to  Emma  from  Sleaford  regarding  no  one  really  wins  in  the  end...  on  the  contrary  Mr  Blair  wins  -  he  wins  because  he  obviously  has  announced  this  to  be  a  vote  winner  and  his  treasury  wins  because  as  an  employer  you  will  know  that  the  amount  of  tax  and  national  insurance  that  the  government  will  receive  from  all  the  minimum  wage  increases  will  rise  and  of  course  not  only  will  be  paying  out  higher  wages  but  as  an  employer  higher  Employer  NI  Contributions  as  well.  If  the  minimum  wage  increases  again  and  if  it  hits  anywhere  near  the  £6.00  mark  there  will  be  12  more  people  on  the  employment  line  and  one  more  small  business  going  bankrupt  -  namely  mine.  Think  of  us  employers  as  well  Mr  Blair,  we  are  not  all  big  corporations  earning  millions.  |||    All  workers  should  be  entitled  to  a  fair  day's  pay  for  a  fair  day's  work.  How  many  people  on  the  minimum  wage  have  any  hope  of  obtaining  a  mortgage  or  saving  towards  retirement?  |||    It  is  good  news  for  many  Asians  living  in  UK.  Students  who  do  odd  jobs  can  increase  their  income  and  can  help  there  family  in  their  home  country.  I  thank  Mr.  Blair  and  his  government  for  increase  in  the  national  minimum  wage." 

2	"Blair  dismisses  quit  claim  report  |||    Tony  Blair  has  dismissed  reports  he  told  Gordon  Brown  he  would  quit  before  the  next  general  election.  |||    ""You  don't  do  deals  over  jobs  like  this,""  the  prime  minister  told  BBC  One's  Breakfast  with  Frost  programme.  According  to  a  new  book,  Brown's  Britain,  Mr  Blair  went  back  on  a  pledge  to  make  way  for  Mr  Brown  after  Cabinet  allies  intervened  in  June  2004.  Mr  Blair  said  the  claims  were  ""reheated  from  six  months  ago""  and  that  he  was  concentrating  on  running  the  country.  Mr  Blair  said:  ""I've  dealt  with  this  six  months  ago.  I  said  then  you  don't  do  deals  over  jobs  like  this  -  you  don't.  |||    ""What  both  of  us  are  actually  concentrating  on  are  the  issues  that  concern  the  country.""  The  book,  by  Sunday  Telegraph  journalist  Robert  Peston  and  serialised  in  the  newspaper,  said  the  pair  had  ""mutual  animosity  and  contempt""  for  each  other.  |||    It  claims  Tony  Blair  felt  by  November  2003  he  had  lost  voters'  trust  because  of  the  Iraq  war  and  that  he  was  no  longer  an  asset  to  the  Labour  Party.  And  that  at  a  dinner  hosted  by  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  he  told  Mr  Brown  of  his  intention  to  stand  down.  According  to  Mr  Peston  the  prime  minister  said:  ""Help  me  to  get  through  the  year  and  I  will  then  stand  down.""  But  he  then  changed  his  mind  in  June  2004,  following  intervention  from  allies  in  the  Cabinet  and  the  suspicion  that  the  chancellor  was  deliberately  manoeuvring  against  him,  according  to  the  book.  |||    Mr  Peston  told  BBC  News:  ""My  understanding  is  that  they  are  not  nearly  as  close  or  as  friendly  as  they  once  were.  ""What  the  book  says  is  there  is  now  a  pretty  profound  mutual  mistrust,  mutual  animosity.  ""I  think  in  public  you  see  this  double-act  pretending  everything  is  alright,  but  in  private  I  don't  think  the  relationship  is  good  because  Brown,  understandably,  feels  deeply  betrayed  -  particularly  over  this  issue  of  the  leadership.""  But,  in  a  wide-ranging  BBC  interview  covering  issues  such  as  the  Asian  tsunami  disaster,  the  Middle  East  peace  process  and  Northern  Ireland,  Mr  Blair  said:  ""When  you  get  to  the  top  in  politics  you  get  this  huge  swell  around  you.  ""All  sorts  of  people  make  all  sorts  of  claims  and  counter-claims.""  He  admitted  to  a  ""sense  of  frustration""  about  the  allegations  which  he  said  had  been  made  ""countless  times"".  |||    There  has  been  fresh  speculation  of  a  rift  recently,  following  their  separate  responses  to  the  Asian  tsunami.  These  rumours  were  fuelled  by  Mr  Blair's  decision  to  hold  his  monthly  media  conference  at  the  same  time  as  a  long-planned  speech  by  Mr  Brown  on  UK  plans  to  tackle  global  poverty  with  a  new  ""Marshall  Plan""  for  Africa.  There  was  speculation  the  pair  were  trying  to  outdo  each  other's  response  to  the  disaster.  But  the  prime  minister  said  he  had  discussed  these  claims  with  the  chancellor  and  dismissed  them  as  a  ""load  of  nonsense"".  Former  welfare  minister  Frank  Field  MP  said  the  prime  minister  should  sack  Mr  Brown,  but  did  not  believe  Mr  Blair  was  strong  enough  to  do  so.  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  accused  the  prime  minister  and  Mr  Brown  of  ""squabbling  like  schoolboys"".  He  told  Sky  News'  Sunday  with  Adam  Boulton:  ""This  is  the  politics  of  the  playground  and  Britain  really  does  deserve  better.""  The  Liberal  Democrat  parliamentary  chairman  Matthew  Taylor  said  the  personal  ambition  of  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  was  ""getting  in  the  way  of  good  government"".  ""Either  they  need  to  grow  up  and  put  their  squabbles  to  one  side  or  they  cannot  expect  the  electorate  to  support  a  divided  government  at  the  next  election.""  During  the  interview  Mr  Blair  also  said  the  former  home  secretary  David  Blunkett  would  play  a  ""big  role""  at  the  general  election." 

2	"'No  UK  apology'  for  colonial  past  |||    The  days  of  Britain  having  to  apologise  for  its  colonial  past  are  over,  Gordon  Brown  has  said.  |||    The  chancellor,  speaking  during  a  week-long  tour  of  Africa,  said  it  was  time  to  talk  about  enduring  British  values  of  liberty  and  tolerance.  Mr  Brown  has  signed  a  debt  relief  deal  with  Tanzania  which  could  cost  the  UK  £1  billion.  South  African  president  Thabo  Mbeki  has  attacked  British  imperialists,  saying  they  treated  Africans  like  savages.  Mr  Brown  said  that  missionairies  had  come  to  Africa  because  of  their  sense  of  duty.  He  added  that  the  history  of  internationalism  and  enterprise  had  given  Britain  a  greater  global  reach  than  any  other  country.  BBC  political  correspondent  Mark  Mardell  said  Britishness  had  long  been  a  theme  of  the  chancellor's  but  ""never  before  has  he  been  so  outspoken  in  defending  Britain's  past  history"".  |||    The  UK  has  pledged  to  pay  10%  of  the  developing  world's  foreign  debt  bill  in  an  attempt  to  fight  poverty.  On  top  of  the  relief  deal  with  Tanzania  Mr  Brown  said  the  UK  would  make  similar  offers  to  70  poorer  nations  around  the  world.  Under  the  plan  -  which  could  cost  the  UK  £1bn  -  countries  must  spend  the  cash  saved  on  health,  education  and  welfare.  ""We  make  this  offer  unilaterally  but  we  are  now  asking  other  countries  to  join  us,""  the  chancellor  said.  Mr  Brown,  on  a  week-long  tour  of  Africa,  spent  two  days  in  Tanzania  before  heading  on  Friday  evening  to  Mozambique,  a  country  where  more  than  half  of  the  17-million  population  lives  below  the  poverty  line.  |||    There  he  is  expected  to  strike  a  similar  debt  relief  pact.  The  chancellor  said  he  hoped  other  G8  and  European  countries  would  follow  suit.  The  UK  has  already  cancelled  its  bilateral  debts  -  money  the  UK  alone  is  owed  -  with  the  world's  poorest  nations  including  Tanzania.  Former  international  development  secretary  Clare  Short  questioned  the  effectiveness  of  debt  relief  as  a  means  of  tackling  poverty." 

2	"Top  judge  clashes  with  ministers  |||    The  UK's  top  judge  has  revealed  he  has  clashed  with  ministers  about  how  the  heads  of  public  inquiries  are  chosen.  |||    Lord  Woolf  said  he  was  determined  his  current  veto  on  whether  a  judge  should  chair  an  inquiry  should  continue  as  a  guard  for  judicial  independence.  But  he  told  MPs  the  Lord  Chancellor,  Lord  Falconer,  was  insisting  he  should  have  the  final  say  in  such  cases.  Lord  Hutton's  inquiry  into  the  death  of  Dr  David  Kelly  sparked  debate  about  who  should  run  inquiries.  |||    The  government  says  the  lord  chancellor  would  be  unlikely  to  go  against  Lord  Woolf's  wishes.  Lord  Woolf,  who  is  Lord  Chief  Justice  of  England  and  Wales,  was  giving  evidence  to  the  Commons  public  administration  select  committee's  inquiry  into  public  inquiries.  He  said  he  had  not  been  involved  in  the  choice  of  Lord  Hutton,  who  as  a  law  lord  did  not  come  under  his  jurisdiction.  But  he  argued  he  should  have  a  veto  on  whether  judges  generally  should  chair  a  particular  inquiry  and  if  so,  which  judge  it  should  be.  In  written  evidence  to  the  committee,  Lord  Woolf  said:  ""I  have,  so  far,  failed  to  reach  an  agreement  with  the  lord  chancellor  on  this  issue  ...  I  intend  to  maintain  my  position  and  will  press  for  this  safeguard  to  be  in  any  future  legislation.""  |||    Judges  should  think  carefully  before  heading  an  inquiry  into  a  highly  political  issue,  such  as  the  intelligence  on  Iraq's  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  he  said.  He  argued:  ""The  subject  matter  of  the  inquiry  may  be  so  political  that  it  would  be  damaging  to  the  judiciary  for  a  judge  to  be  involved.  ""In  addition,  the  question  of  whether  there  should  be  an  inquiry  at  all  may  be  highly  controversial  and  if  a  judge  is  appointed,  the  judiciary,  as  a  result  of  the  appointment,  may  be  seen  as  siding  inappropriately  with  the  government.""  He  told  the  MPs:  ""Anything  that  tends  to  undermine  the  confidence  of  the  public  in  the  judiciary  worries  me.""  |||    Lord  Woolf  said  the  current  rules  were  not  written  down  but  it  was  inconceivable  in  practice  that  the  lord  chancellor  would  overrule  his  concerns.  But  that  situation  could  change  with  new  legal  reforms.  The  issue  had  been  ""overlooked""  when  a  new  agreement  was  drawn  up  about  those  responsibilities  and  the  dispute  had  emerged  in  later  discussions.  ""What  I  am  asking  for  is  a  situation  where  if  the  lord  chancellor  cannot  obtain  my  agreement  [on  appointing  a  judge],  it  doesn't  happen,""  he  said.  |||    Lord  Woolf  said  he  did  not  think  there  would  be  difficulties  but  he  wanted  to  establish  the  principle.  A  Department  for  Constitutional  Affairs  spokeswoman  said  Lord  Woolf  and  Lord  Falconer  agreed  about  what  happened  in  practice.  ""Their  disagreement  is  about  whether  the  legislation  should  include  a  requirement  for  consultation  or  concurrence  -  a  very  narrow  dispute,  in  Lord  Woolf's  words,""  she  said.  ""As  Lord  Woolf  also  acknowledged,  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  the  lord  chancellor  would  appoint  a  judge  against  the  wishes  of  the  lord  chief  justice.  ""Judges  are  free  to  decide  for  themselves  whether  to  accept  positions  as  inquiry  chairs.""  Parliament  will  examine  the  issue  next  year  when  it  debates  a  new  bill  about  public  inquiries." 

0	"Dollar  gains  on  Greenspan  speech  |||    The  dollar  has  hit  its  highest  level  against  the  euro  in  almost  three  months  after  the  Federal  Reserve  head  said  the  US  trade  deficit  is  set  to  stabilise.  |||    And  Alan  Greenspan  highlighted  the  US  government's  willingness  to  curb  spending  and  rising  household  savings  as  factors  which  may  help  to  reduce  it.  In  late  trading  in  New  York,  the  dollar  reached  $1.2871  against  the  euro,  from  $1.2974  on  Thursday.  Market  concerns  about  the  deficit  has  hit  the  greenback  in  recent  months.  On  Friday,  Federal  Reserve  chairman  Mr  Greenspan's  speech  in  London  ahead  of  the  meeting  of  G7  finance  ministers  sent  the  dollar  higher  after  it  had  earlier  tumbled  on  the  back  of  worse-than-expected  US  jobs  data.  ""I  think  the  chairman's  taking  a  much  more  sanguine  view  on  the  current  account  deficit  than  he's  taken  for  some  time,""  said  Robert  Sinche,  head  of  currency  strategy  at  Bank  of  America  in  New  York.  ""He's  taking  a  longer-term  view,  laying  out  a  set  of  conditions  under  which  the  current  account  deficit  can  improve  this  year  and  next.""  |||    Worries  about  the  deficit  concerns  about  China  do,  however,  remain.  China's  currency  remains  pegged  to  the  dollar  and  the  US  currency's  sharp  falls  in  recent  months  have  therefore  made  Chinese  export  prices  highly  competitive.  But  calls  for  a  shift  in  Beijing's  policy  have  fallen  on  deaf  ears,  despite  recent  comments  in  a  major  Chinese  newspaper  that  the  ""time  is  ripe""  for  a  loosening  of  the  peg.  The  G7  meeting  is  thought  unlikely  to  produce  any  meaningful  movement  in  Chinese  policy.  In  the  meantime,  the  US  Federal  Reserve's  decision  on  2  February  to  boost  interest  rates  by  a  quarter  of  a  point  -  the  sixth  such  move  in  as  many  months  -  has  opened  up  a  differential  with  European  rates.  The  half-point  window,  some  believe,  could  be  enough  to  keep  US  assets  looking  more  attractive,  and  could  help  prop  up  the  dollar.  The  recent  falls  have  partly  been  the  result  of  big  budget  deficits,  as  well  as  the  US's  yawning  current  account  gap,  both  of  which  need  to  be  funded  by  the  buying  of  US  bonds  and  assets  by  foreign  firms  and  governments.  The  White  House  will  announce  its  budget  on  Monday,  and  many  commentators  believe  the  deficit  will  remain  at  close  to  half  a  trillion  dollars."

But  he  is  not  on  the  list  of  producers  who  can  win  a  best  film  Oscar  due  to  a  limit  on  the  number  of  nominees.  The  Oscars  organisers  have  picked  two  of  The  Aviator's  four  producers  to  be  nominated  for  best  film.  |||    Up  to  three  producers  can  be  named  per  film  but  the  studios  behind  The  Aviator  and  Million  Dollar  Baby  failed  to  trim  their  credits  -  so  the  Academy  of  Motion  Pictures  Arts  and  Sciences  (Ampas)  has  done  it  for  them.  The  Aviator's  nominated  producers  are  Michael  Mann  and  Graham  King  -  with  Mr  Evans  and  Sandy  Climan,  Mr  Mann's  former  deputy,  left  off.  Mr  Evans  sued  Mr  Mann  in  2001,  claiming  he  came  up  with  the  idea,  spent  years  developing  it  and  persuaded  DiCaprio  to  play  Hughes  -  but  said  he  was  later  excluded  from  the  project.  The  two  sides  settled  out  of  court  in  a  deal  that  has  remained  secret  apart  from  the  fact  Mr  Evans'  name  has  appeared  as  a  producer  when  the  film's  credits  roll.  At  the  Golden  Globes,  Mr  Evans  -  who  was  named  among  the  winners  when  the  film  won  best  drama  film  -  evaded  a  security  guard  to  have  his  photo  taken  with  DiCaprio,  director  Martin  Scorsese,  Mr  Mann  and  Mr  King.  |||    Ampas  decided  to  limit  the  number  of  producers  who  could  be  nominated  after  Shakespeare  in  Love's  victory  in  1999  saw  five  producers  collect  awards.  The  eligible  names  for  The  Aviator  and  Million  Dollar  Baby  were  decided  by  Ampas'  producers  branch  executive  committee  on  Wednesday.  The  decision  also  saw  Clint  Eastwood  get  his  third  personal  nomination  for  Million  Dollar  Baby.  He  is  now  named  in  the  best  film  category  as  well  as  being  nominated  for  best  director  and  best  lead  actor.
