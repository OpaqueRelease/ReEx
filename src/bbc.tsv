2	"Cardinal  criticises  Iraq  war  cost  |||    Billions  of  pounds  spent  on  conflict  in  Iraq  and  in  the  Middle  East  should  have  been  used  to  reduce  poverty,  Cardinal  Cormac  Murphy-O'Connor  has  said.  |||    The  head  of  the  Catholic  Church  in  England  and  Wales  made  the  comments  on  BBC  Radio  4  and  will  re-iterate  his  stance  in  his  Christmas  Midnight  Mass.  The  cardinal  used  a  Christmas  message  to  denounce  the  war  in  Iraq  as  a  ""terrible""  waste  of  money.  He  and  the  Archbishop  of  Canterbury  have  both  spoken  out  about  the  war.  |||    Speaking  on  BBC  Radio  4's  Thought  for  the  Day  slot,  he  criticised  the  fact  that  ""billions""  have  been  spent  on  war,  instead  of  being  used  to  bring  people  ""out  of  dire  poverty  and  malnourishment  and  disease"".  The  cardinal  said  2005  should  be  the  year  for  campaigning  to  ""make  history  poverty"".  He  added:  ""If  the  governments  of  the  rich  countries  were  as  ready  to  devote  to  peace  the  resources  they  are  willing  to  commit  to  war,  that  would  be  to  see  with  new  eyes  and  speak  with  a  new  voice  and  perhaps  then  others  would  listen  to  us  with  new  ears.""  The  cardinal  will  touch  on  this  theme  again  on  Friday  night  when  he  will  tell  the  congregation  of  2,000  at  Westminster  Cathedral  that  peace  is  ""worth,  always,  striving  for"".  |||    ""How  is  it  that  peace  has  not  arrived?,""  the  cardinal  will  ask.  ""How  is  it  that  there  is  war  in  Iraq,  violence  in  the  Holy  Land,  and  the  horror  of  pain  and  death  amongst  the  poor  and  deprived  who  suffer  from  injustice  and  thus  do  not  find  peace?""  ""How  can  one  wish  a  happy  Christmas  for  our  fellow  Christians  in  Iraq  or  in  the  Holy  Land  or  those  who  suffer  in  Africa  unless  you  and  I,  in  whatever  way  is  open  to  us,  say  and  do  what  makes  for  peace?""  Both  the  Cardinal  and  Archbishop  of  Canterbury  Dr  Rowan  Williams  appealed  for  the  weapons  inspectors  to  be  given  more  time  in  Iraq  before  the  war  started.  Dr  Williams  has  since  criticised  the  government  over  its  case  for  war,  saying  the  failure  to  find  weapons  of  mass  destruction  had  damaged  faith  in  the  political  system.  |||    On  Friday,  the  Cardinal  will  ask  the  congregation  to  search  for  peace.  ""It  is  possible,  it  is  real,  it  is  worth,  always,  striving  for,  because  of  the  promise  of  Our  Saviour,""  he  will  say.  ""I  also  wish  you  peace  in  your  homes  because  peace  in  your  home  is  the  beginning  of  peace  in  the  homes  of  the  community.  ""  A  spokesman  said  Downing  Street  had  no  comment  to  make.  But  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  has  said  he  will  put  Africa  at  the  top  of  the  agenda  when  Britain  chairs  the  G8  summit  next  year."

Barclays'  chief  John  Varley  said  the  bank  had  ""caught  the  winds""  of  a  very  strong  world  economy.  Earnings  at  Barclays  Capital  investment  bank  rose  25%  to  £1.04bn,  but  investment  in  branch  operations  held  back  growth  in  its  UK  retail  business.  |||    The  group  is  the  first  of  Britain's  five  big  banks  to  report  2004  results.  According  to  analysts'  forecasts,  HSBC,  the  biggest  UK  bank  by  stock  market  valuation,  will  report  profits  of  £9.4bn  later  this  month.  |||    Barclays  results  were  in  line  with  market  expectations.  Its  Global  Investors  wing  made  £347m,  an  82%  jump  on  2003  figures.  Profits  at  Barclaycard  rose  by  5%  to  £801m  but  were  said  to  have  been  affected  by  a  series  of  interest  rate  rises  and  investment  to  grow  its  customer  base.  The  bank  also  blamed  margins  pressure  on  its  mortgage  business  and  spending  on  its  branches  over  the  past  year  for  a  1%  fall  in  profits  in  its  UK  retail  division  to  £1.13bn.  |||    ""The  outlook  for  2005  is  good  as  a  result  of  balance  sheet  growth  and  investments  made  in  2004,""  Mr  Varley  said.  Barclays  cautioned  that  growth  this  year  may  be  slower  than  in  2004  on  the  back  of  softer  US  and  Chinese  economies  and  the  impact  of  interest  rate  rises  on  household  spending  in  the  UK.  It  added  its  bid  to  acquire  a  controlling  stake  in  South  Africa's  leading  retail  bank  Absa,  was  being  considered  by  regulatory  authorities.  Speaking  on  BBC  Radio  4,  Mr  Varley  declined  to  be  drawn  on  reports  that  Barclays  had  held  merger  talks  with  US  bank  Wells  Fargo.  A  tie-up  between  Barclays  and  California-based  Wells  Fargo  would  create  the  world's  fourth  biggest  bank,  valued  at  $180bn.  At  1405  GMT,  shares  in  Barclays  were  trading  down  0.67%  at  590  pence.  ""The  headline  numbers  are  in  line,  but  the  story  is  costs,""  said  analyst  Alex  Potter  at  Lehman  Brothers.  ""They  are  a  bit  more  aggressive  than  we  had  expected.  The  cost  overshoot  is  not  in  Barclays  Capital  but  in  the  UK  bank.""" 

2	"Blair  and  Brown  criticised  by  MPs  |||    Labour  MPs  have  angrily  criticised  Tony  Blair  and  Gordon  Brown  amid  renewed  reports  of  a  rift  between  the  two  men.  |||    A  meeting  of  the  Parliamentary  Labour  Party  saw  a  succession  of  normally  loyal  members  warn  that  feuding  could  jeopardise  Labour's  election  hopes.  The  PM  insisted  nothing  would  derail  Labour's  campaign,  despite  a  new  book  saying  he  has  upset  his  chancellor  by  backing  out  of  a  pledge  to  stand  aside.  Mr  Brown  will  again  be  in  the  public  eye  at  the  party's  new  poster  launch.  In  what  the  party  had  hoped  would  be  perceived  as  a  show  of  unity,  he  is  due  to  line  up  alongside  Alan  Milburn  -  the  man  controversially  appointed  as  the  party's  election  supremo  -  and  deputy  leader  John  Prescott  for  the  event  in  London  on  Tuesday.  Relations  between  Mr  Brown  and  Mr  Milburn  are  widely  reported  to  be  cool  ever  since  Mr  Blair  brought  the  latter  back  into  the  Cabinet  to  run  Labour's  election  campaign,  a  role  successfully  carried  out  by  Mr  Brown  in  both  1997  and  2001.  |||    Mr  Blair  told  the  Parliamentary  Labour  Party  on  Monday:  ""I  know  from  everyone  here,  in  Cabinet  and  government,  nothing  is  going  to  get  in  the  way  of  a  unified  Labour  Party  with  a  unified  position  and  winning  the  third  term  people  desperately  need.""  |||    The  prime  minister  and  his  chancellor  arrived  within  seconds  of  each  other  for  the  meeting  of  the  PLP  and  were  seemingly  in  good  spirits  as  it  started.  New  speculation  about  the  state  of  their  relationship  was  sparked  by  claims  in  Brown's  Britain,  by  Sunday  Telegraph  journalist  Robert  Peston,  which  suggested  Mr  Blair  went  back  on  a  pledge  to  make  way  for  Mr  Brown.  Labour's  Paul  Flynn  said  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  had  a  ""scorching""  from  MPs  adding:  ""It  was  a  Parliamentary  Labour  Party  meeting  like  no  other.""  |||    Backbencher  Stephen  Pound  said  some  MPs  had  threatend  to  expose  those  fuelling  the  reports  if  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  did  not  ""stop  this  nonsense,  this  poisonous  briefing"".  Lord  Campbell-Savours,  a  former  MP,  challenged  Mr  Brown  to  deny  reports  that  he  had  told  the  prime  minister  he  did  not  believe  anything  he  said.  Mr  Prescott  said  MPs  were  entitled  to  complain  about  discipline  after  reading  recent  press  reports.  |||    ""They  told  us  very  clearly,  it  was  the  troops  telling  the  leaders:  get  in  line,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  on  Tuesday.  Mr  Prescott  said  there  were  occasional  disagreements  in  any  government.  But  he  argued  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown  could  work  successfully  together  and  had  produced  a  strong  economy  and  better  public  services.  |||    The  new  book  claims  Mr  Prescott  hosted  a  dinner  in  November  2003  where  the  prime  minister  told  Mr  Brown  he  would  stand  down  before  the  next  election  because  he  had  lost  trust  over  the  Iraq  war.  He  had  then  changed  his  mind  in  June  2004,  following  intervention  from  Cabinet  allies  and  suspicion  that  the  chancellor  was  manoeuvring  against  him,  writes  Mr  Peston.  Mr  Prescott  said  there  was  a  dinner  but  the  discussions  were  confidential.  ""Of  course  as  a  waiter  for  10  years  I  have  a  professional  ability  here,""  he  joked.  Mr  Blair  has  insisted  he  has  done  no  deals  over  the  premiership  while  Mr  Brown  says  he  will  not  let  ""gossip""  distract  him  from  helping  a  unified  election  campaign.  The  Conservatives  say  the  two  men  are  behaving  like  squabbling  schoolboys  and  the  Liberal  Democrats  claim  personal  ambition  is  obstructing  good  government." 

0	"Turkey  knocks  six  zeros  off  lira  |||    Turkey  is  to  relaunch  its  currency  on  Saturday,  knocking  six  zeros  off  the  lira  in  the  hope  of  boosting  trade  and  powering  its  growing  economy.  |||    The  change  will  see  the  end  of  such  dizzyingly-high  denominations  as  five  million  lira  -  enough  for  a  short  taxi  ride  -  and  the  20m  note,  worth  $15.  These  valuations  were  the  product  of  decades  of  inflation  which,  as  recently  as  2001,  was  as  high  as  70%.  Inflation  has  since  been  tamed  and  economic  prospects  are  improving.  |||    The  currency  -  officially  to  be  known  as  the  new  lira  -  will  be  launched  at  midnight  on  1  January.  From  that  point,  the  one-million  lira  note  will  become  the  new  one-lira  coin.  The  government  hopes  the  change  will  be  seen  as  a  promise  of  growing  economic  stability  as  Turkey  embarks  on  the  long  process  of  trying  to  join  the  European  Union.  |||    On  an  everyday  level,  it  is  hoped  the  change  will  stimulate  more  international  trade  and  end  confusion  among  foreign  investors  and  Turks  alike.  ""The  transition  to  the  new  Turkish  lira  shows  clearly  that  our  economy  has  broken  the  vicious  circle  that  it  was  imprisoned  in  for  long  years,""  said  Sureyya  Serdengecti,  head  of  the  Turkish  Central  Bank.  ""The  new  lira  is  also  the  symbol  of  the  stable  economy  that  we  dreamed  of  for  long  years.""  |||    The  Turkish  economy  teetered  on  the  brink  of  collapse  in  2001  when  the  lira  plunged  in  value  and  two  million  people  lost  their  jobs.  |||    Turkey  had  to  turn  to  the  International  Monetary  Fund  for  financial  assistance,  accepting  a  $18bn  loan  in  return  for  pushing  through  a  wide-ranging  austerity  programme.  These  tough  measures  have  borne  fruit.  Inflation  fell  below  10%  earlier  this  year  for  the  first  time  in  decades  while  exports  are  up  30%  this  year.  Meanwhile,  the  economy  is  expanding  at  a  healthy  rate,  with  7.9%  growth  expected  in  2004.  The  government  hopes  that  the  new  currency  will  cement  the  country's  economic  progress,  two  weeks  after  EU  leaders  set  a  date  for  the  start  of  Turkey's  accession  talks.  |||    The  slimmed-down  lira  is  likely  to  be  widely  welcomed  by  the  business  community.  |||    ""The  Turkish  lira  has  been  like  funny  money,""  Tevfik  Aksoy,  chief  Turkish  economist  for  Deutsche  Bank,  told  Associated  Press.  ""Now  at  least  in  cosmetic  terms  it  will  look  like  real  currency.""  However,  some  do  not  feel  quite  so  happy  about  seeing  the  nominal  value  of  their  investments  reduced.  ""If  a  person  has  10  billion  lira  in  investments  this  will  suddenly  decrease,""  shop  owner  Hayriye  Evren,  told  Associated  Press.  ""This  will  definitely  affect  people  psychologically.""" 

2	"'EU  referendum  could  cost  £80m'  |||    It  could  cost  £80m  to  run  a  UK  referendum  on  the  European  constitution,  ministers  have  revealed.  |||    In  a  written  parliamentary  answer,  Constitutional  Affairs  Minister  Chris  Leslie  said  the  poll  was  likely  to  cost  the  same  as  a  general  election.  Mr  Leslie  said  the  cost  could  not  be  compared  with  the  only  previous  British  referendum,  held  30  years  ago.  Ministers  say  the  constitution  would  make  the  European  Union  work  better  but  critics  fear  creating  a  ""super  state"".  Labour  MP  John  Cryer,  whose  question  revealed  the  price  estimate,  said  the  cost  surprised  him  but  was  not  a  central  factor  as  it  was  important  people  had  their  say.  But  he  said  it  would  have  been  better  to  have  rejected  the  constitution  so  avoiding  the  need  for  a  referendum.  The  2001  election  cost  £80m.  No  date  for  the  vote  has  been  set  but  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  has  suggested  it  is  unlikely  to  be  held  until  early  2006  -  after  the  predicted  date  for  the  next  election.  Most  voters  said  the  UK  should  stay  in  the  Common  Market  in  the  1975  referendum." 

2	"Boothroyd  calls  for  Lords  speaker  |||    Betty  Boothroyd  has  said  the  House  of  Lords  needs  its  own  Speaker  and  that  peers  should  lead  the  way  on  reforming  the  upper  chamber.  |||    Baroness  Boothroyd,  who  was  the  first  woman  to  be  Commons  Speaker,  said  she  believed  Tony  Blair  initiated  reforms  without  a  clear  outcome  in  mind.  ""Now  we  have  to  take  care  of  it  ourselves  and  make  the  best  of  it,""  she  told  the  BBC's  Breakfast  with  Frost.  In  1999  Labour  removed  all  but  92  of  the  Lords'  750  hereditary  peers.  That  was  billed  as  the  first  stage  of  reform  of  the  institution.  The  lord  chancellor  hinted  further  reforms  could  be  unveiled  in  the  next  Labour  manifesto.  |||    ""I  think  we  need  to  look  very  carefully  at  the  relationship  between  the  Lords  and  the  Commons,""  Lord  Falconer  told  BBC1's  Breakfast  With  Frost.  ""How  it  interacts  with  the  Commons  is  a  very,  very  important  issue.  ""We  need  to  address  the  issue  in  the  manifesto,  but  you  will  have  to  wait  for  when  the  manifesto  comes.""  The  lord  chancellor  currently  has  the  role  of  House  of  Lords  speaker.  He  is  also  head  of  the  judiciary  and  a  member  of  the  Cabinet  as  constitutional  affairs  secretary.  |||    Lady  Boothroyd  said  she  believed  it  was  unacceptable  for  the  lord  chancellor  to  have  the  role  of  Speaker.  ""I  would  really  like  to  see  a  Speaker  of  the  House  of  Lords,""  she  said.  ""I  don't  go  for  the  idea  of  somebody  -  a  lord  chancellor  -  who  is  head  of  the  judiciary,  a  senior  Cabinet  minister  and  Speaker  of  the  Lords.  ""I  want  somebody  there  who  is  going  to  look  after  that  House  and  do  a  job  there." 

2	"Regiments'  group  in  poll  move  |||    A  regiments'  campaign  group  is  to  target  nine  marginal  Labour  seats  at  the  General  Election.  |||    Save  the  Scottish  Regiments  will  also  field  a  candidate  against  Armed  Forces  Minister  Adam  Ingram  in  East  Kilbride.  The  group,  which  is  unhappy  at  defence  merger  plans,  is  endorsing  opposition  candidates  in  nine  seats.  The  marginals  are  Aberdeen  South,  Dumfriesshire,  Dundee  East  and  West,  South  West  Edinburgh,  Ochil,  Stirling,  East  Renfrewshire  and  Western  Isles.  The  campaigners  unveiled  a  huge  poster  featuring  Black  Watch  soldiers  fighting  the  war  in  Iraq  before  they  announced  their  election  plans.  |||    Former  Scots  Guardsman  Allan  Hendry  will  challenge  Mr  Ingram.  The  group  said  it  is  well  organised,  with  350  volunteers,  and  will  be  announcing  at  least  one  other  candidate  later.  It  added  that  it  can  only  be  stopped  from  inflicting  serious  damage  on  Labour  if  the  government  reverses  its  plan  to  merge  the  six  Scottish  regiments.  |||    Scotland's  only  Conservative  MP  Peter  Duncan  said  the  Save  the  Scottish  Regiments  had  done  a  ""superb  job""  in  fighting  against  defence  cuts.  He  added:  ""Their  actions  have  reflected  the  pride  that  most  people  in  this  country  have  in  our  troops,  and  have  shown  a  steely  determination  to  make  Labour  pay  for  their  betrayal.  ""I  have  been  honoured  to  speak  at  their  rallies  throughout  Scotland.""  Scottish  National  Party  leader  Alex  Salmond  said  it  had  received  a  ""big  boost""  from  the  campaign's  decision  to  endorse  SNP  candidates  in  four  marginal  seats.  |||    ""Labour's  arrogance  has  been  their  undoing.  In  trying  to  get  rid  of  Scotland's  historic  regiments,  Labour  MPs  will  end  up  being  scrapped  themselves,""  he  said.  However,  Labour  MP  George  Foulkes  said  the  campaigners  would  not  make  any  difference  to  the  outcome  of  the  election  and  would  not  win  the  argument.  ""A  serving  soldier  knows  that  what  Labour  is  proposing  is  right,""  he  said.  As  well  as  their  election  move,  Save  the  Scottish  Regiments  will  join  other  campaigners  at  a  rally  in  London  in  the  spring.  Defence  Secretary  Geoff  Hoon  announced  last  year  that  Scotland's  regiments  would  be  combined  into  a  single  unit.  The  move  was  part  of  overall  Army  reforms." 

3	"Republic  to  face  China  and  Italy  |||    The  Republic  of  Ireland  have  arranged  friendlies  against  China  and  Italy  which  will  take  place  at  Lansdowne  Road  in  March  and  August.  |||    Brian  Kerr's  side  will  face  the  54th  ranked  Chinese  on  29  March  -  just  three  days  after  the  World  Cup  qualifier  against  Israel  in  Tel  Aviv.  Italy  will  visit  on  17  August  in  what  will  be  a  warm-up  game  ahead  of  the  autumn  World  Cup  qualifiers.  In  their  last  meeting,  the  Irish  beat  Italy  in  the  1994  World  Cup  Finals.  However,  that  is  the  Republic's  only  victory  in  eight  attempts  against  the  Italians  who  have  won  all  the  other  seven  games.  The  29  March  game  will  be  the  second  time  the  Republic  have  played  China  -  the  previous  encounter  back  in  June  1984  with  the  Irish  winning  1-0  in  Sapporo,  Japan.  Brian  Kerr  said:  ""China  have  made  great  progress  over  the  last  few  years  and  will  provide  difficult  opposition.  ""We  all  witnessed  the  performances  of  the  Asian  teams  in  the  last  World  Cup,  and  China  play  a  similar  type  of  football.  ""As  for  Italy,  they  make  a  welcome  return  to  Dublin  and  will  be  a  massive  attraction  because  they  are  one  of  the  great  traditional  powers  in  the  world.  ""The  game  will  be  ideal  preparation  for  the  three  important  World  Cup  qualifiers  in  the  autumn.""  Ireland  round  off  their  World  Cup  campaign  with  games  against  France  on  7  September,  Cyprus  on  8  October  and  Switzerland  on  12  October." 

2	"Short  attacks  US  over  tsunami  aid  |||    Former  Cabinet  minister  Clare  Short  has  criticised  the  US-led  tsunami  aid  coalition,  saying  the  UN  should  be  leading  efforts.  |||    President  Bush  has  announced  that  an  alliance  of  the  US,  India,  Australia  and  Japan  will  co-ordinate  a  humanitarian  drive.  But  Ms  Short  said  the  effect  of  the  parallel  coalition  would  be  to  undermine  the  UN.  She  said  only  the  UN  had  the  ""moral  authority""  to  lead  the  relief  work.  Ms  Short  resigned  as  international  development  secretary  over  the  Iraq  war.  ""I  think  this  initiative  from  America  to  set  up  four  countries  claiming  to  co-ordinate  sounds  like  yet  another  attempt  to  undermine  the  UN  when  it  is  the  best  system  we  have  got  and  the  one  that  needs  building  up,""  she  said.  ""Only  really  the  UN  can  do  that  job,""  she  told  BBC  Radio  Four's  PM  programme.  ""It  is  the  only  body  that  has  the  moral  authority.  But  it  can  only  do  it  well  if  it  is  backed  up  by  the  authority  of  the  great  powers.""  Ms  Short  said  the  countries  involved  could  not  boast  good  records  on  their  response  to  major  disasters.  The  US  was  ""very  bad  at  coordinating  with  anyone""  and  India  had  its  own  problems,  Ms  Short  said.  ""I  don't  know  what  that  is  about  but  it  sounds  very  much,  I  am  afraid,  like  the  US  trying  to  have  a  separate  operation  and  not  work  with  the  rest  of  the  world  through  the  UN  system,""  she  added."

AEFA  has  more  than  12,000  advisers  selling  financial  advice,  funds  and  insurance  to  2.5  million  customers.  Over  the  years  it  has  delivered  poor  profits  and  even  some  losses.  |||    ""This  is  an  excellent  move  by  American  Express  to  focus  on  its  core  businesses,  and  sell  off  a  laggard  division,  which  has  been  a  problem  for  quite  some  time,""  said  Marquis  Investment  Research  analyst  Phil  Kain.  Analysts  estimate  that  a  stand-alone  AEFA  could  have  a  market  value  of  $10bn  (£5.3bn).  The  unit  was  acquired  by  American  Express  20  years  ago  as  Investors  Diversified  Service,  of  Minneapolis,  at  a  time  when  firms  were  amassing  one-stop  financial  empires.  However,  the  business  of  selling  investments  was  never  integrated  with  the  rest  of  the  group."

It  is  currently  arguing  against  an  offer  from  Swiss  Xstrata,  which  the  firm  raised  to  A$8.4bn  last  week  after  WMC  said  it  was  an  undervaluation.  Now  reports  say  that  the  Australian  government  is  against  the  deal.  |||    Trade  Minister  Mark  Vaile  has  said  that  the  bid  may  be  ""against  the  national  interest"".  Mr  Vaile,  who  was  quoted  in  the  Australian  Financial  Review,  compared  Xstrata's  attempt  to  take  over  WMC  to  a  similar  bid  by  oil  giant  Shell  for  Australia's  Woodside  Petroleum  in  2001.  The  bid  was  thrown  out  by  Treasurer  Peter  Costello  on  national  interest  grounds.  WMC's  interests  in  uranium  deposits  were  a  contributing  factor,  Mr  Vaile  said.  WMC  itself,  however,  has  no  objection  in  principle  to  being  bought  out,  having  spun  off  its  aluminium  operations  in  2002  to  make  itself  a  more  tempting  target  -  as  long  as  the  price  is  right.  Its  stellar  performance  in  2004  has  been  built  on  sky-high  prices  for  metals.  Copper  and  nickel  in  particular  have  been  in  high  demand  thanks  to  China's  booming  economy,  which  expanded  more  than  9%  in  each  of  the  past  two  years.  Nickel  prices  rose  43%  during  the  year,  with  copper  up  36%." 

2	"Choose  hope  over  fear  -  Kennedy  |||    Voters  will  have  a  clear  choice  between  the  politics  of  fear  and  the  politics  of  hope  in  the  next  general  election,  said  Charles  Kennedy.  |||    In  his  New  Year  message  the  Liberal  Democrat  leader  said  Labour  and  the  Conservatives  were  united  in  relying  on  fear  and  ""populist  scares"".  He  said  his  party  was  the  one  of  hope  and  was  ready  for  a  2005  poll.  On  the  Asian  tsunami  he  said  it  had  been  ""very  heartening""  to  learn  of  the  generosity  being  shown  by  Britons.  Mr  Kennedy  said  his  thoughts  were  with  all  those  caught  up  in  the  disaster,  which  had  dominated  the  Christmas  and  New  Year  period.  At  home  he  said  many  people  were  turning  to  the  Liberal  Democrats  as  they  became  disheartened  with  the  politics  of  the  other  two  main  parties.  |||    The  general  election  would  be  a  three-party  struggle,  as  the  Conservative  party  ""fades  away""  as  a  national  force  and  the  Liberal  Democrats  challenge  Labour  in  its  heartlands,  he  said.  ""A  clear  division  is  emerging  in  British  politics  -  the  politics  of  fear  versus  the  politics  of  hope.  ""Labour  is  counting  on  the  politics  of  fear,  ratcheting  up  talk  of  threats,  crime  and  insecurity.  While  the  Conservatives  are  re-working  their  populist  scares  about  asylum  and  the  European  'menace',""  he  said.  He  said  the  government  was  using  this  climate  of  fear  to  try  to  strip  away  civil  liberties.  |||    It  was  already  using  detention  without  trial  at  Belmarsh  Prison,  ignoring  a  recent  Law  Lords  judgement  that  this  contravenes  basic  human  rights,  he  said.  He  also  criticised  attempts  to  bring  in  trial  without  jury,  plans  to  lower  the  burden  of  proof  in  some  criminal  trials,  curbing  of  rights  to  protest,  increased  stop  and  search  powers  and  ID  card  plans.  He  said  while  everyone  had  the  right  to  be  secure  they  also  had  the  right  to  be  protected  against  unfair  discrimination.  ""But  at  the  same  time,  an  overmighty  state  is  a  dangerous  one,""  he  said.  His  party  ""instinctively""  understood  the  ""new  liberal  Britain""  which  is  no  longer  a  nation  with  one  family  structure,  and  one  colour,  he  said.  ""We  are  less  deferential;  more  inclined  to  think  for  ourselves;  more  open  about  sexuality  and  equality.  ""Our  national  institutions  are  changing  too.  We  are  no  longer  a  nation  of  one  church;  we  are  a  nation  of  many  faiths.  In  our  attitudes  and  the  way  we  live  our  lives,  this  is  in  many  ways  a  liberal  Britain.""" 

1	"Grammys  honour  soul  star  Charles  |||    The  memory  of  soul  legend  Ray  Charles  dominated  the  music  world's  leading  music  ceremony  on  Sunday  as  he  was  given  eight  posthumous  Grammy  Awards.  |||    Charles,  who  died  in  2004,  got  honours  including  record  and  album  of  the  year,  while  Alicia  Keys  and  actor  Jamie  Foxx  performed  a  musical  tribute  to  him.  R&B  star  Keys  won  four  awards  herself  at  the  Grammy  ceremony  in  Los  Angeles.  U2,  Usher,  Norah  Jones  and  Kanye  West  got  three  each.  West  led  the  race  going  into  the  ceremony  with  10  nominations.  |||    Charles'  last  album,  Genius  Loves  Company,  a  collection  of  duets  that  has  sold  more  than  two  million  copies,  was  named  album  of  the  year  and  best  pop  vocal  album.  His  song  Here  We  Go  Again  with  Norah  Jones  won  record  of  the  year  and  best  pop  vocal  collaboration,  while  Heaven  Help  Us  All  with  Gladys  Knight  picked  up  best  gospel  performance.  Jones  said:  ""I'm  glad  he's  getting  recognised,  because  of  who  he  is  and  how  much  I  love  him.""  Actor  Jamie  Foxx  -  who  is  nominated  for  an  Oscar  for  playing  Charles  in  the  hit  movie  Ray  -  dedicated  a  rendition  of  Georgia  on  My  Mind  to  ""old  friends"".  Keys,  looking  to  replicate  her  Grammys  success  of  2002,  when  she  won  five,  picked  up  best  R&B  song  for  You  Don't  Know  My  Name  and  best  R&B  album  for  The  Diary  of  Alicia  Keys.  She  also  shared  the  award  for  best  R&B  vocal  performance  by  a  duo  or  group  with  Usher  for  My  Boo.  |||    Usher's  other  victories  were  for  best  contemporary  R&B  album  for  Confessions  and  best  rap/sung  collaboration  for  Yeah!,  featuring  Lil  Jon  and  Ludacris.  Kanye  West  dominated  the  rap  categories,  winning  best  rap  song  for  Jesus  Walks  and  best  rap  album  for  The  College  Dropout.  But  in  one  of  the  night's  biggest  shocks,  he  lost  out  in  the  battle  to  be  named  best  new  artist  to  pop  rock  act  Maroon  5.  Vertigo  by  rock  giants  U2  won  three  trophies  -  best  rock  song,  best  short  video  and  best  rock  vocal  performance  by  a  duo  or  group.  One  of  the  other  main  awards,  song  of  the  year,  went  to  US  singer-songwriter  John  Mayer  for  Daughters.  Mayer  also  won  best  male  pop  vocal  performance.  Britney  Spears  picked  up  her  first  ever  Grammy  for  her  song  Toxic,  which  was  named  best  dance  recording.  |||    Rod  Stewart  also  won  the  first  Grammy  of  his  career,  getting  the  best  traditional  pop  album  award  for  Stardust...  The  Great  American  Songbook:  Volume  III.  In  2003,  Stewart  said  he  was  ""astounded""  he  had  never  won  a  Grammy  -  but  ""they  tend  not  to  give  it  to  the  British  unless  you're  Sting"".  There  were  few  other  high-profile  British  victors  this  year.  Annie  Lennox,  metal  group  Motorhead  and  dance  act  Basement  Jaxx  all  took  home  trophies.  But  Elvis  Costello,  who  had  four  nominations,  and  Joss  Stone  and  Franz  Ferdinand,  who  were  both  up  for  three  awards,  got  nothing.  |||    Beach  Boys  veteran  Brian  Wilson  was  another  first-time  winner  -  for  best  rock  instrumental  performance.  ""It  represents  triumph  and  achievement  in  music  that  I  feel  that  I  deserved,  and  I'm  really  glad  I  won,""  he  said.  A  live  recording  of  composer  John  Adams'  11  September  tribute,  On  the  Transmigration  of  Souls,  performed  by  the  New  York  Philharmonic,  won  three  classical  prizes.  And  former  US  President  Bill  Clinton  picked  up  the  second  Grammy  of  his  career,  winning  the  spoken  word  award  for  the  audio  version  of  his  autobiography  My  Life." 

2	"Blunkett  unveils  policing  plans  |||    People  could  be  given  the  mobile  phone  number  of  their  local  bobby  under  an  overhaul  of  policing  in  England  and  Wales  unveiled  by  David  Blunkett.  |||    The  plans  include  a  dedicated  policing  team  for  each  neighbourhood  and  a  10  point  compulsory  customer  charter.  The  home  secretary  said  targets  would  be  put  in  place  to  ensure  that  the  public  got  a  good  response  from  police.  Local  people  would  also  be  able  to  ""trigger""  action  on  specific  problems  if  they  felt  nothing  was  being  done.  Local  councillors  would  have  to  show  certain  conditions  had  been  met  before  invoking  the  power.  And  police  could  refuse  the  request  if  the  complaints  were  frivolous,  would  only  cause  annoyance  or  would  pose  too  heavy  a  burden  on  resources.  |||    Mr  Blunkett  said  a  new  three  digit  number  would  be  created  for  non-emergency  phone  calls  to  police.  The  best  performing  police  services  would  get  more  cash  and  extra  freedoms,  he  said,  but  he  would  not  shirk  from  stepping  in  where  the  public  was  being  failed.  The  home  secretary's  powers  to  suspend  or  sack  chief  constables  are  being  reviewed  after  Mr  Blunkett's  battle  with  Humberside  chief  David  Westwood  over  intelligence  failures  on  Soham  murderer  Ian  Huntley.  |||    Opposition  parties  also  want  more  local  policing  to  tackle  nuisance  behaviour  and  other  crime  but  they  accuse  ministers  of  tying  the  police  up  with  paperwork.  Tory  spokesman  David  Davis  said  the  proposals  were  ""little  more  than  a  taxpayer-funded  PR  exercise""  ahead  of  a  general  election  predicted  for  next  May.  |||    Police  forces  were  already  ""buried""  under  existing  government  initiatives  and  there  was  little  in  the  latest  plans  to  reassure  them,""  said  Mr  Davis.  Earlier  Lib  Dem  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  said  the  government  was  right  to  want  to  increase  the  links  between  local  people  and  the  police.  ""But  these  measures  will  only  work  if  they're  matched  with  a  cut  in  the  amount  of  paperwork  -  and  investment  in  modern  equipment  to  keep  the  police  out  on  the  streets.""  |||    Before  delivering  a  statement  to  MPs,  Mr  Blunkett  was  joined  by  Tony  Blair  at  Welling  School,  in  south  east  London,  which  is  at  the  heart  of  a  community  policing  initiative.  Mr  Blunkett  said  he  wanted  ""to  go  back  to  a  time  when  I  was  very  young,  when  you  expected  the  police  to  be  part  of  the  community  and  the  community  to  be  part  of  policing  and  where  people  were  joined  together  in  partnership  making  it  work"".  The  prime  minister  said  the  law-abiding  citizen  should  be  in  charge  of  the  community  and  ""not  the  minority  who  want  to  cause  trouble"".  |||    Mr  Blunkett  already  boasts  about  producing  record  police  numbers.  He  has  also  started  to  recruit  25,000  Community  Support  Officers  (CSOs)  and  the  new  plans  would  allow  all  police  forces  to  give  them  the  power  to  detain  suspects.  An  extra  £50m  was  promised  on  Tuesday  so  2,000  new  CSOs  can  be  recruited  now  rather  than  next  year.  Within  two  years,  every  force  will  be  expected  to  keep  to  a  ""coppers'  contract""  on  what  kind  of  service  the  public  can  expect.  A  Mori  poll  this  summer  suggested  policing,  unlike  health  and  education,  was  the  one  major  public  service  where  people  were  less  satisfied  the  more  contact  they  had  with  it.  The  plans  also  include  the  idea  of  allowing  people  join  police  forces  at  different  levels  rather  than  the  traditional  way  of  making  everybody  spend  specific  amounts  of  time  as  a  constable  before  being  promoted.  There  will  also  be  ""specific  exercises""  to  encourage  black  and  Asian  people  to  join  the  police  at  senior  ranks." 

2	"Blair  joins  school  sailing  trip  |||    The  prime  minister  has  donned  a  life  jacket  and  joined  school  children  in  a  sailing  dinghy  as  he  sought  to  sell  his  party's  education  policies.  |||    Tony  Blair  sailed  across  the  lake  in  Bromsgrove,  Worcestershire,  while  on  a  visit  with  Education  Secretary  Ruth  Kelly  to  back  school  outings.  Mr  Blair  later  stressed  Labour's  election  pledge  to  focus  on  education,  when  he  met  parents  in  the  area.  The  Conservatives  and  Lib  Dems  both  say  his  pledges  are  ""worthless"".  All  the  parties  are  stepping  up  campaigning  ahead  of  a  General  Election  widely  expected  to  be  held  on  5  May.  Mr  Blair,  looking  a  little  windswept,  joined  two  girls  from  St  Egwin's  Middle  School  in  Evesham  and  an  instructor  for  a  trip  in  the  Wayfarer  dinghy,  closely  followed  by  a  boat  full  of  photographers.  |||    Afterwards  he  said  outdoor  activities  were  beneficial  for  children  but  accepted  that  lots  of  teachers  now  worried  about  taking  part  for  fear  of  being  sued  if  something  went  wrong.  ""What  we're  doing  is  introducing  some  simple  guidelines  so  if  teachers  follow  those  they  are  not  going  to  be  at  risk  of  legal  action,""  Mr  Blair  said.  ""When  you  are  doing  these  types  of  activities  you've  got  to  exercise  some  common  sense  there  obviously.  ""You  can't  have  a  situation  where  parents  or  teachers  end  up  being  worried  that  they're  going  to  be  subject  to  all  sorts  of  legal  action  if  they  take  children  sailing  or  doing  outdoor  activity  that  is  actually  good  for  the  kids  and  good  for  their  health  and  their  character.""  |||    The  pledge  on  education  -  ""your  child  achieving  more""  -  was  one  of  six  election  pledges  unveiled  by  Mr  Blair  last  week.  If  it  wins  a  third  term  in  the  general  election  expected  this  year,  Labour  is  committed  to  giving  parents  more  choice  between  schools;  allowing  all  secondary  schools  to  take  on  specialist  status;  opening  200  city  academies  and  creating  100,000  more  sixth-form  places.  It  aims  to  improve  discipline  in  schools  by  adopting  a  ""zero  tolerance""  approach  to  disruption  of  classes  and  introducing  fixed  penalty  notices  for  truants.  Labour  also  plans  to  give  head  teachers  at  groups  of  local  schools  control  over  funding  for  units  to  handle  disruptive  pupils.  |||    Parents  and  teachers  who  met  Mr  Blair  on  Tuesday  were  invited  to  the  informal  discussion  after  writing  to  their  MPs  to  raise  concerns  about  education.  It  is  the  latest  in  a  series  of  events  designed  to  show  the  prime  minister  is  speaking  directly  to  voters  in  the  run-up  to  the  election  -  and  that  he  has  not  lost  touch.  For  the  Conservatives,  shadow  education  secretary  Tim  Collins  said:  ""Mr  Blair&#191;s  government  is  all  talk.  He  must  be  judged  on  what  he  has  done  in  two  terms,  not  what  he  mendaciously  claims  he  would  do  in  a  third.  That  judgment  will  be  damning.""  The  Liberal  Democrats  are  promising  to  cut  class  sizes  for  the  youngest  children  and  ensure  all  children  are  taught  by  a  qualified  teacher  in  each  subject." 

3	"O'Connell  rejects  Lions  rumours  |||    Ireland  and  Munster  lock  Paul  O'Connell  has  dismissed  media  reports  linking  him  to  the  captaincy  of  the  Lions  tour  to  New  Zealand  this  summer.  |||    O'Connell  is  rumoured  to  be  among  the  front-runners  for  the  job,  but  says  he  is  totally  focused  on  Sunday's  Six  Nations  crunch  clash  with  England.  ""I  honestly  don't  think  about  these  reports,""  he  told  BBC  Sport.  ""The  Lions  thing  is  all  speculation  and  newspaper  talk,  nothing  more.  I  just  ignore  it  and  get  on  with  my  job.""  He  added:  ""The  only  thing  that  annoys  me  after  reading  some  reports  is  what  the  opposition  locks  think.  ""I  can  just  imagine  them  saying  'I'm  going  to  show  this  guy  what's  what  about  second  row  play'.  That's  the  one  thing  that  makes  me  cringe.""  O'Connell,  who  made  a  try-scoring  international  debut  against  Wales  two  years  ago,  is  enjoying  his  meteoric  rise  into  rugby's  shop  window  -  but  refuses  to  be  drawn  on  the  Lions.  |||    ""I  have  spoken  to  Sir  Clive  Woodward  a  few  times,  but  not  for  very  long,  certainly  nothing  about  summer  holidays,""  he  joked.  He  also  said  he  remains  wary  of  wounded  England's  abilities  coming  into  Sunday's  game  after  two  straight  defeats,  dismissing  predictions  of  a  certain  Irish  victory.  ""It's  very  dangerous  to  think  that.  This  England  team  has  so  much  experience  and  skill.  You  do  not  become  a  bad  team  overnight.  ""They  have  two  world  class  game-breakers  in  Josh  Lewsey  and  Jason  Robinson,  while  Charlie  Hodgson  is  just  ready  to  click  into  place.""  He  insisted  Ireland  will  not  make  the  mistake  of  being  over-confident.  ""That's  not  going  to  happen  in  our  squad.  No  Ireland  team  lining  up  to  play  England  will  ever  fall  into  that  trap,""  he  said.  ""Every  time  we  play  England  we  know  what  a  big  task  it  is.  Look  at  what  they  did  to  us  two  years  ago.  I  remember  that  game  all  too  well,  and  it  was  not  a  good  feeling.  ""I  came  on  as  a  replacement  and  we  were  losing  13-6,  and  ended  up  getting  hammered  42-6,  so  I  know  what  can  happen  when  England  come  to  Dublin.  ""They  could  so  easily  have  been  coming  to  Dublin  with  two  wins  and  staring  a  Grand  Slam  in  the  face  as  well.""" 

2	"New  rules  tackle  'sham  weddings'  |||    New  rules  on  marriage  for  foreign  nationals  living  in  the  UK  are  coming  into  force.  |||    From  Tuesday,  most  non-EU  citizens  will  need  Home  Office  approval  to  marry.  The  Home  Office  says  the  new  rules  are  aimed  at  reducing  the  number  of  sham  marriages,  of  which  there  are  estimated  to  be  up  to  15,000  a  year.  But  immigrants'  group  the  Joint  Council  for  the  Welfare  of  Immigrants  (JCWI)  says  the  rules  breach  human  rights  law  and  it  may  mount  a  legal  challenge.  When  the  changes  were  unveiled  last  year,  immigration  minister  Des  Browne  said:  ""Our  aim  is  to  avoid  unnecessary  disruption  of  genuine  marriages,  while  providing  firm  controls  to  prevent  abuse.""  Under  the  previous  regulations  anybody  wishing  to  get  married  in  the  UK  only  had  to  produce  evidence  they  had  been  resident  in  the  country  for  a  week  and  give  15  days  notice  of  the  wedding  at  the  local  register  office.  |||    But  from  Tuesday  all  non-EU  nationals,  apart  from  citizens  of  Switzerland,  Liechtenstein,  Iceland  or  Norway,  intending  to  wed  in  the  UK  must  either  obtain  a  visa  allowing  them  to  get  married  before  they  enter  the  country  or  apply  for  a  Home  Office  'certificate  of  marriage  approval'.  To  get  a  certificate,  costing  £135,  applicants  will  have  to  send  proof  that  they  have  a  legal  right  to  be  in  the  UK.  Those  without  a  settled  status,  such  as  asylum  seekers  awaiting  a  decision  on  their  application,  will  have  no  right  to  marry  in  the  UK.  |||    Once  they  have  the  necessary  documentation,  those  subject  to  immigration  controls  wishing  to  get  married  in  England  or  Wales  must  register  their  intention  to  marry  at  one  of  76  specially-designated  register  offices.  They  can,  however,  marry  at  the  register  office  or  church  of  their  choice.  Rhian  Beynon  of  the  JCWI  said  the  new  rules  were  ""not  proportionate""  and  ""discriminatory"".  |||    ""These  rules  means  in  some  cases  the  Home  Secretary  is  going  to  be  a  marriage  registrar  of  last  resort.  ""We're  currently  taking  a  legal  opinion  on  this.  We'll  be  looking  for  people  whose  right  to  marry  is  breached  and  we'll  be  looking  at  taking  a  case  on  this  to  the  Human  Rights  Court,""  Ms  Beynon  said.  The  new  rules  have  also  been  called  into  question  by  the  parliamentary  Joint  Committee  on  Human  Rights.  In  a  report  published  last  July  the  cross-party  committee  stated  there  was  a  ""significant  risk""  the  new  procedures  were  incompatible  with  the  right  to  marry  because  they  introduced  restrictions  which  were  ""disproportionate"".  The  committee  believed  the  new  laws  might  be  incompatible  with  the  Human  Rights  Act  on  the  grounds  of  religion,  belief  and  nationality,  the  report  added.  |||    Over  the  last  year  immigration  service  operations  against  marriages  of  convenience  have  been  stepped  up  resulting  in  a  growing  number  of  convictions.  In  January  25  people  who  took  part  in  a  sham  marriage  network  based  in  Leicester  were  jailed  for  a  total  of  35  years.  And  last  November  Samuel  Amoah,  a  Belgian  national  who  set  up  two  sham  weddings  for  couples  who  wanted  to  remain  in  the  UK,  was  jailed  for  three  years.  Several  other  cases  are  currently  going  through  the  courts.  The  role  of  registrars  who  under  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Act  1999  were  obliged  to  report  suspected  sham  marriages  to  the  Home  Office,  has  been  key  in  many  prosecutions.  Registrars'  spokesman,  Mark  Rimmer,  said  they  welcomed  the  new  marriage  regulations  and  believed  they  would  be  an  significant  deterrent.  ""They  will  effectively  remove  most  of  the  blatant  cases.  Certainly  those  who  are  illegals  in  this  country,  of  which  we  had  quite  a  few,  will  no  longer  be  getting  married,""  Mr  Rimmer  said.  Mr  Rimmer,  the  service  director  for  registrations  of  marriages  at  Brent  Council  in  north-west  London,  said  he  did  not  consider  the  new  law  to  be  an  infringement  of  civil  liberties.  ""It  may  be  seen  to  be  far  more  draconian  than  it  has  been  but  certainly  it's  still  not  as  difficult  to  marry  in  the  UK  than  it  is  to  marry,  for  example,  in  Holland,  Germany  or  France.  ""I  think  it's  a  proportionate  response  by  government  to  what  was  a  very  large  problem,""  Mr  Rimmer  said." 

2	"Blair  to  face  MPs  amid  feud  talk  |||    Tony  Blair  faces  his  first  prime  minister's  questions  of  2005  after  a  week  of  renewed  speculation  about  his  relationship  with  Gordon  Brown.  |||    Meanwhile,  the  chancellor  is  leaving  Britain  on  a  high-profile  tour  of  Africa  to  highlight  poverty  issues.  But  before  doing  so,  he  insisted  he  still  trusted  Mr  Blair,  despite  claims  to  the  contrary  in  a  new  book.  Labour  MPs  have  warned  against  disunity  and  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  may  well  take  up  the  theme  in  the  Commons.  The  Tories  have  already  accused  the  prime  minister  and  his  chancellor  of  behaving  like  ""schoolboys  squabbling  in  a  playground"".  |||    Michael  Howard  is  likely  to  want  to  capitalise  further  on  the  spat  when  he  goes  head-to-head  with  the  prime  minister  in  the  Commons.  At  a  campaign  poster  launch  on  Tuesday,  Mr  Brown  was  joined  by  Alan  Milburn,  who  Mr  Blair  controversially  put  in  charge  of  election  planning  in  place  of  the  chancellor.  |||    Later  this  week  the  prime  minister  is  due  to  set  out  the  themes  of  his  party's  next  election  manifesto,  which  for  the  past  two  polls  have  been  drawn  up  by  the  chancellor.  Mr  Brown,  meanwhile,  is  visiting  Tanzania,  Mozambique  and  Kenya  to  highlight  the  plight  of  many  Africans  hit  by  Aids,  war  and  famine  -  issues  which  Mr  Blair  has  also  spoken  out  on.  The  prime  minister  and  chancellor  faced  backbench  discontent  at  Monday's  meeting  of  the  Parliamentary  Labour  Party  over  claims  made  in  journalist  Robert  Peston's  new  book.  Mr  Blair  told  MPs  and  peers:  ""I  know  from  everyone  here,  in  Cabinet  and  government,  nothing  is  going  to  get  in  the  way  of  a  unified  Labour  Party  with  a  unified  position  and  winning  the  third  term  people  desperately  need.""  Labour's  Paul  Flynn  said  the  pair  had  had  a  ""scorching""  from  MPs.  |||    On  Tuesday,  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Mr  Prescott  told  BBC  News:  ""They  told  us  very  clearly,  it  was  the  troops  telling  the  leaders:  get  in  line.""  The  new  book  claims  Mr  Prescott  hosted  a  dinner  in  November  2003  where  the  prime  minister  told  Mr  Brown  he  would  stand  down  before  the  next  election  because  he  had  lost  trust  over  the  Iraq  war.  Mr  Blair  then  changed  his  mind  in  June  2004,  after  Cabinet  allies  intervened  and  amid  suspicion  the  chancellor  was  manoeuvring  against  him,  writes  Mr  Peston.  In  Mr  Peston's  book  Mr  Brown  is  alleged  to  have  told  the  prime  minister:  ""There  is  nothing  you  could  ever  say  to  me  now  that  I  could  ever  believe.""" 

2	"Faith  schools  citizenship  warning  |||    Schools  must  improve  the  quality  of  citizenship  lessons  -  or  social  cohesion  and  democracy  will  suffer,  says  the  education  watchdog.  |||    Independent  faith  schools  were  singled  out  by  Ofsted  chief,  David  Bell,  for  not  doing  enough  to  promote  the  ""wider  tenets  of  British  society"".  Mr  Bell  said  Muslim,  Jewish  and  Evangelical  Christian  schools  must  be  ""intolerant  of  intolerance"".  Diversity  ""certainly  must  not  mean  segregated  or  separate"",  he  said.  Mr  Bell's  speech  called  for  a  much  greater  effort  in  all  types  of  schools  to  teach  citizenship  -  with  an  accompanying  survey  showing  that  young  people  knew  little  about  politics  and  had  no  enthusiasm  to  find  out  more.  |||    Badly-taught  citizenship  lessons  have  previously  been  criticised  by  Mr  Bell,  and  in  a  speech  to  the  Hansard  Society,  he  warned  that  it  was  failing  to  pass  on  an  understanding  of  democracy,  public  service  and  shared  values.  He  highlighted  his  particular  concern  for  citizenship  in  the  growing  number  of  independent  faith  schools  -  which  he  said  included  about  100  Muslim,  100  Evangelical  Christian  and  50  Jewish  schools.  |||    Mr  Bell  expressed  concern  about  schools  which  did  not  teach  children  enough  about  a  ""common  heritage""  and  needed  to  do  more  to  promote  principles  of  mutual  tolerance  and  social  inclusion.  ""I  worry  that  many  young  people  are  being  educated  in  faith-based  schools,  with  little  appreciation  of  their  wider  responsibilities  and  obligations  to  British  society,""  said  Mr  Bell.  The  Ofsted  chief  said  his  forthcoming  annual  report  would  make  particular  reference  to  Muslim  schools.  ""Many  must  adapt  their  curriculum  to  ensure  that  it  provides  pupils  with  a  broad  general  knowledge  of  public  institutions  and  services  in  England  and  helps  them  to  acquire  an  appreciation  of  and  respect  for  other  cultures  in  a  way  that  promotes  tolerance  and  harmony.""  Mr  Bell  said  such  questions  of  religion  and  cultural  identity  were  ""tricky  issues"".  But  he  argued  that  ""we  must  not  allow  our  recognition  of  diversity  to  become  apathy  in  the  face  of  any  challenge  to  our  coherence  as  a  nation"".  ""I  would  go  further  and  say  that  an  awareness  of  our  common  heritage  as  British  citizens,  equal  under  the  law,  should  enable  us  to  assert  with  confidence  that  we  are  intolerant  of  intolerance,  illiberalism  and  attitudes  and  values  that  demean  the  place  of  certain  sections  of  our  community,  be  they  women  or  people  living  in  non-traditional  relationships,""  said  Mr  Bell."

""Nothing  like  it  has  ever  been  seen  in  Ireland  before,""  said  Justin  Green,  spokesman  for  organisers  MCD  Promoters.  ""We  could  have  sold  a  million  tickets.""  The  Dublin  dates  on  June  24  and  25  form  part  of  the  worldwide  Vertigo  tour.  The  tour  begins  in  San  Diego  on  28  March  and  will  cover  13  US  cities.  The  band  will  also  play  24  European  gigs,  finishing  in  Lisbon  in  August.  |||    Mr  Green  said  that  ticket  outlets  had  been  ""bombarded""  by  U2  fans.  ""Unfortunately  there's  thousands  and  thousands  of  disappointed  fans  all  over  the  country  which  is  disappointing,  but  there's  only  two  dates  confirmed,""  he  said.  Many  fans  camped  on  the  streets  of  the  Irish  capital  for  three  days  to  ensure  they  were  first  in  line  at  Ticketmaster  in  St  Stephen's  Green  Shopping  Centre,  where  the  tickets  went  on  sale  on  Friday.  However  the  majority  of  tickets,  priced  at  between  59.50  and  80  euro  each,  were  sold  online.  Earlier  this  week,  Bono  announced  that  the  band  would  play  two  shows  at  the  venue,  which  holds  almost  80,000  people,  due  to  the  phenomenal  demand  for  tickets." 

1	"Hoffman  hits  out  over  modern  film  |||    Hollywood  legend  Dustin  Hoffman  has  hit  out  at  the  quality  of  current  films  and  theatre  productions.  |||    The  star  of  Rain  Man  and  Tootsie  said  the  film  culture  was  ""in  the  craphouse""  at  a  press  conference  on  Tuesday.  The  67-year-old  also  said  he  stopped  working  a  few  years  ago  because  he  lost  his  ""spark""  for  acting.  Hoffman  is  in  the  UK  to  publicise  his  new  comedy,  Meet  the  Fockers,  which  also  stars  Robert  De  Niro,  Barbra  Streisand  and  Ben  Stiller.  |||    He  said:  ""You  go  to  the  cinema  and  you  realise  you're  watching  the  third  act.  There  is  no  first  or  second  act.  ""There  is  this  massive  film-making  where  you  spend  this  incredible  amount  of  money  and  play  right  to  the  demographic.  ""You  can  tell  how  much  money  the  film  is  going  to  make  by  how  it  does  on  the  first  weekend.  ""The  whole  culture  is  in  the  craphouse.  It's  not  just  true  in  the  movies,  it's  also  true  in  the  theatre.  ""Broadway,  and  now  London  is  the  same,  special  effects  are  in  great  demand.  It's  not  a  good  time  culturally.""  |||    Hoffman  also  said  he  stopped  working  a  few  years  ago  and  moved  into  directing  and  writing.  He  said:  ""I  just  lost  that  spark  I  always  had.  ""A  couple  of  years  ago  I  didn't  like  the  parts  I  was  getting.  ""Studios  weren't  interested  in  the  kind  of  films  that  people  of  my  generation  wanted  to  see.  ""I  thought  I  would  stop  and  just  try  writing  and  directing.  I  wasn't  aware  of  the  depression  that  set  in.""  Recently,  Hoffmann  has  returned  to  film,  with  roles  in  I  Heart  Huckabees,  Finding  Neverland  and  now  Meet  the  Fockers,  which  is  the  sequel  to  Meet  the  Parents.  Meet  The  Fockers  opens  in  the  UK  on  Friday." 

0	"UK  'risks  breaking  golden  rule'  |||    The  UK  government  will  have  to  raise  taxes  or  rein  in  spending  if  it  wants  to  avoid  breaking  its  ""golden  rule"",  a  report  suggests.  |||    The  rule  states  that  the  government  can  borrow  cash  only  to  invest,  and  not  to  finance  its  spending  projects.  The  National  Institute  of  Economic  and  Social  Research  (NIESR)  claims  that  taxes  need  to  rise  by  about  £10bn  if  state  finances  are  to  be  put  in  order.  The  Treasury  said  its  plans  were  on  track  and  funded  until  2008.  According  to  NIESR,  if  the  government's  current  economic  cycle  runs  until  March  2006  then  it  is  ""unlikely""  the  golden  rule  will  be  met.  Should  the  cycle  end  a  year  earlier,  then  the  chances  improve  to  ""50/50"".  Either  way,  fiscal  tightening  is  needed,  NIESR  said.  |||    The  report  is  the  latest  to  call  into  question  the  viability  of  government  spending  projections.  Earlier  this  month,  accountancy  firm  Ernst  &  Young  said  that  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  Gordon  Brown's  forecasts  for  tax  revenues  were  too  optimistic.  |||    It  claimed  revenues  were  likely  to  be  £6bn  below  estimates  by  the  end  of  the  tax  year  despite  the  economy  growing  in  line  with  forecasts.  A  Treasury  spokesperson  dismissed  the  latest  claims,  saying  it  was  ""on  track  to  meeting  spending  rules  and  the  golden  rule  in  the  current  cycle  and  beyond"".  ""Spending  plans  have  been  set  out  until  2008  and  they  are  fully  affordable.""  Other  than  its  warning  on  possible  tax  hikes,  the  NIESR  report  was  optimistic  about  the  state  of  the  UK  and  global  economy.  |||    It  said  the  recent  record-busting  surge  in  oil  prices  would  have  a  limited  effect  on  worldwide  expansion,  saying  that  if  anything  the  ""world  economy  will  continue  to  grow  strongly"".  Global  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  tipped  to  be  4.1%  this  year,  dipping  to  4%  in  2005,  before  picking  up  again  to  4.2%  in  2006.  The  US  will  continue  to  drive  expansion  until  2006,  albeit  at  a  slightly  slower  rate,  as  will  be  the  case  in  Japan.  Hinting  at  better  times  for  UK  exporters,  NIESR  said  the  euro  zone  ""is  expected  to  pick  up  speed"".  |||    Growth  in  Britain  also  is  set  to  accelerate,  it  forecast.  ""Despite  weak  growth  in  the  third  quarter,  the  forces  sustaining  the  upswing  remain  intact  and  the  economy  will  expand  robustly  in  2005  and  2006,""  NIESR  said,  adding  that  ""the  economy  will  become  better  balanced  over  the  next  two  years  as  exports  stage  a  recovery"".  GDP  is  expected  at  3.2%  in  2004,  and  2.8%  in  both  2005  and  2006.  The  main  cloud  on  the  horizon,  NIESR  said,  was  the  UK's  much  analysed  and  fretted  over  property  market." 

2	"Whitehall  shredding  increasing  -  Tories  |||    Civil  servants  have  drastically  stepped  up  the  shredding  of  official  documents,  figures  compiled  by  the  Tories  suggest.  |||    Some  government  departments  had  doubled  the  number  of  documents  being  shredded  ahead  of  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act's  implementation  on  1  January.  Departments  for  defence,  environment  and  trade,  which  had  all  increased  file  destruction,  said  they  were  following  rules  governing  public  records.  But  the  Tories  want  the  information  commissioner  to  investigate.  The  Freedom  of  Information  Act  will  for  the  first  time  give  members  of  the  public  access  to  government  records  previously  kept  secret  for  30  years.  But  BBC  Political  Correspondent  James  Hardy  said  the  prospect  of  outsiders  poking  their  noses  into  the  inner  workings  of  Whitehall  appeared  to  be  causing  jitters  among  the  mandarins.  |||    Liberal  Democrat  Alan  Beith  -  who  chairs  the  select  committee  which  monitors  the  Department  of  Constitutional  Affairs  -  said  if  the  claims  were  true,  Whitehall  was  ""acting  entirely  against  the  spirit  of  the  new  Act"".  ""Both  the  information  commissioner  and  the  select  committee  will  have  to  keep  this  issue  under  very  close  scrutiny.""  Fellow  Lib  Dem  Norman  Baker  said  the  episode  painted  an  ""unflattering  picture  of  the  inner  workings  of  government"".  ""It  is  clear  that  the  government's  initial  enthusiasm  for  open  government  has  turned  to  self-serving  cynicism.""  Dr  Julian  Lewis,  the  Conservative  spokesman  for  the  Cabinet  Office,  said  he  had  discovered  a  huge  acceleration  in  shredding  from  a  series  of  parliamentary  answers.  |||    The  Department  of  Work  and  Pensions  destroyed  nearly  37,000  files  last  year  -  up  22,000  on  four  years  ago  when  the  Act  was  passed.  The  number  of  files  destroyed  by  the  Ministry  of  Defence  and  the  departments  of  Environment,  Food  and  Rural  Affairs  and  Trade  and  Industry  has  also  risen  dramatically.  Dr  Lewis  has  called  for  an  investigation  by  the  information  commissioner  Richard  Thomas.  Earlier  this  week,  Mr  Thomas  said  he  was  looking  into  Cabinet  Office  orders  telling  staff  to  delete  e-mails  more  than  three  months  old.  He  said  he  ""totally  condemned""  the  deletion  of  e-mails  to  prevent  their  disclosure  under  freedom  of  information  laws  coming  into  force  on  1  January.  |||    Government  guidance  said  e-mails  should  only  be  deleted  if  they  served  ""no  current  purpose"",  Mr  Thomas  said.  A  Cabinet  Office  spokeswoman  said  the  move  was  not  about  the  new  laws  or  ""the  destruction  of  important  records"".  The  Freedom  of  Information  Act  will  cover  England,  Wales  and  Northern  Ireland  from  next  year.  Similar  measures  are  being  brought  in  at  the  same  time  in  Scotland.  It  provides  the  public  with  a  right  of  access  to  information  held  by  about  100,000  public  bodies,  subject  to  various  exemptions." 

0	"Dollar  hovers  around  record  lows  |||    The  US  dollar  hovered  close  to  record  lows  against  the  euro  on  Friday  as  concern  grows  about  the  size  of  the  US  budget  deficit.  |||    Analysts  predict  that  the  dollar  will  remain  weak  in  2005  as  investors  worry  about  the  state  of  the  US  economy.  The  Bush  administration's  apparent  unwillingness  to  intervene  to  support  the  dollar  has  caused  further  concern.  However,  trading  has  been  volatile  over  the  past  week  because  of  technical  and  automated  trading  and  light  demand.  This  has  amplified  reactions  to  news,  analysts  said,  adding  that  they  expect  markets  to  become  less  jumpy  in  January.  |||    The  dollar  was  trading  at  $1.3652  versus  the  euro  on  Friday  morning  after  hitting  a  fresh  record  low  of  $1.3667  on  Thursday.  One  dollar  bought  102.55  yen.  |||    Disappointing  business  figures  from  Chicago  triggered  the  US  currency's  weakness  on  Thursday.  The  National  Association  of  Purchasing  Management-Chicago  said  its  manufacturing  index  dropped  to  61.2,  a  bigger  fall  than  expected.  ""There  are  no  dollar  buyers  now,  especially  after  the  Chicago  data  yesterday,""  said  ABN  Amro's  Paul  Mackel.  At  the  same  time,  German  Chancellor  Gerhard  Schroeder  and  Italian  Prime  Minister  Silvio  Berlusconi  voiced  concerns  about  the  strength  of  the  euro.  Mr  Berlusconi  said  the  euro's  strength  was  ""absolutely  worrying""  for  Italian  exports.  Mr  Schroeder  said  in  a  newspaper  article  that  stability  in  foreign  exchange  markets  required  a  correction  of  global  economic  imbalances.  Investors  will  now  look  towards  February's  meeting  of  finance  ministers  from  the  G7  industrialised  nations  in  London  for  clues  as  to  whether  central  banks  will  combine  forces  to  stem  the  dollar's  decline." 

0	"Air  Jamaica  back  in  state  control  |||    The  Jamaican  government  is  regaining  control  of  Air  Jamaica  in  an  bid  to  help  the  ailing  company  out  of  its  financial  difficulties.  |||    The  firm  has  failed  to  make  money  since  the  state  sold  a  majority  stake  to  hotel  tycoon  Gordon  Stewart  in  1994.  In  common  with  many  carriers,  Air  Jamaica,  with  debts  of  $560m  (£291m),  has  been  hit  by  high  fuel  costs  and  the  impact  of  the  11  September  attacks.  The  company  will  be  restructured  with  the  aim  of  finding  a  new  buyer.  ""The  administration  is  committed  to  a  viable  national  airline  that  will  serve  as  a  major  catalyst  for  our  economy,""  said  Finance  Minister  Omar  Davies.  The  35-year-old  airline  transports  about  55%  of  all  passengers  to  the  island  and  its  pilots  are  reportedly  among  the  best  paid  in  the  industry,  with  senior  members  of  staff  earning  in  excess  of  $234,000  a  year." 

0	"Call  centre  users  'lose  patience'  |||    Customers  trying  to  get  through  to  call  centres  are  getting  impatient  and  quicker  to  hang  up,  a  survey  suggests.  |||    Once  past  the  welcome  message,  callers  on  average  hang  up  after  just  65  seconds  of  listening  to  canned  music.  The  drop  in  patience  comes  as  the  number  of  calls  to  call  centres  is  growing  at  a  rate  of  20%  every  year.  ""Customers  are  getting  used  to  the  idea  of  an  'always  available'  society,""  says  Cara  Diemont  of  IT  firm  Dimension  Data,  which  commissioned  the  survey.  However,  call  centres  also  saw  a  sharp  increase  of  customers  simply  abandoning  calls,  she  says,  from  just  over  5%  in  2003  to  a  record  13.3%  during  last  year.  When  automated  phone  message  systems  are  taken  out  of  the  equation,  where  customers  have  to  pick  their  way  through  multiple  options  and  messages,  the  number  of  abandoned  calls  is  even  higher  -  a  sixth  of  all  callers  give  up  rather  than  wait.  One  possible  reason  for  the  lack  in  patience,  Ms  Diemont  says,  is  the  fact  that  more  customers  are  calling  'on  the  move'  using  their  mobile  phones.  |||    The  surge  in  customers  trying  to  get  through  to  call  centres  is  also  a  reflection  of  the  centres'  growing  range  of  tasks.  ""Once  a  call  centre  may  have  looked  after  mortgages,  now  its  agents  may  also  be  responsible  for  credit  cards,  insurance  and  current  accounts,""  Ms  Diemont  says.  Problems  are  occurring  because  increased  responsibility  is  not  going  hand-in-hand  with  more  training,  the  survey  found.  |||    In  what  Dimension  Data  calls  an  ""alarming  development"",  the  average  induction  time  for  a  call  centre  worker  fell  last  year  from  36  to  just  21  days,  leaving  ""agents  not  equipped  to  deal  with  customers"".  This,  Ms  Diemont  warns,  is  ""scary""  and  not  good  for  the  bottom  line  either.  Poor  training  frustrates  both  call  centre  workers  and  customers.  As  a  result,  call  centres  have  a  high  ""churn  rate"",  with  nearly  a  quarter  of  workers  throwing  in  the  towel  every  year,  which  in  turn  forces  companies  to  pay  for  training  new  staff.  Resolution  rates  -  the  number  of  calls  where  a  customer's  query  is  resolved  to  mutual  satisfaction  -  are  running  at  just  50%.  When  the  query  is  passed  on  to  a  second  or  third  person  -  a  specialist  or  manager  -  rates  rise  to  about  70%,  but  that  is  still  well  below  the  industry  target  of  an  85%  resolution  rate.  |||    Suggestions  that  ""outsourcing""  -  relocating  call  centres  to  low-cost  countries  like  India  or  South  Africa  -  is  to  blame  are  wrong,  Ms  Diemont  says.  |||    There  are  ""no  big  differences  in  wait  time  and  call  resolution""  between  call  centres  based  in  Europe  or  North  America  and  those  in  developing  countries  around  the  world.  ""You  can  make  call  centres  perform  anywhere  if  you  have  good  management  and  the  right  processes  in  place,""  she  says.  However,  companies  that  decide  to  ""offshore""  their  operations  are  driven  not  just  by  cost  considerations.  Only  42%  of  them  say  that  saving  money  is  the  main  consideration  when  closing  domestic  call  centre  operations.  Half  of  them  argue  that  workers  in  other  countries  offer  better  skills  for  the  money.  But  not  everybody  believes  that  outsourcing  and  offshoring  are  the  solution.  Nearly  two-thirds  of  all  firms  polled  for  the  survey  have  no  plans  to  offshore  their  call  centres.  They  give  three  key  reasons  for  not  making  the  move:  |||    -  call  centre  operations  are  part  of  their  business  ""core  function"",      -  they  are  worried  about  the  risk  of  going  abroad,      -  they  fear  that  they  will  damage  their  brand  if  they  join  the  offshoring  drive.  The  survey  was  conducted  by  Sunovate  on  behalf  of  Dimension  Data,  and  is  based  on  in-depth  questionnaires  of  166  call  centres  in  24  countries  and  five  continents.  What  are  your  experiences  with  call  centres?  Are  you  happy  to  listen  to  Vivaldi  or  Greensleeves,  or  do  you  want  an  immediate  response?  And  if  you  work  in  a  call  centre:  did  your  training  prepare  you  for  your  job?" 

0	"Weak  dollar  hits  Reuters  |||    Revenues  at  media  group  Reuters  slipped  11%  during  2004,  mainly  due  to  the  weakness  of  the  dollar,  the  group  said.  |||    The  company  said  it  was  optimistic  about  growth  even  as  revenues  slipped  11%  from  £3.24bn  ($6.13bn)  in  2003  to  £2.89bn  in  2004.  Reuters  beat  profit  forecasts,  posting  a  52%  rise  in  profits  for  the  year  to  £198m  from  the  £130m  seen  a  year  earlier.  Reuters  also  beat  its  savings  target  for  2004,  delivering  £234m  of  cuts.  Under  its  three-year  Fast  Forward  turnaround  plan  it  had  aimed  to  save  £220m  during  the  12  months  to  31  December.  |||    Reuters  also  managed  to  slow  a  decline  in  underlying  revenues  to  5.4%  from  10.2%  in  2003  and  cut  its  debt  back  to  £160m  from  £610m  a  year  earlier.

""Improving  customer  relationships,  more  competitive  products  and  continued  strong  cost  discipline  position  us  well  for  2005,""  chief  executive  Tom  Glocer  said,  adding  the  company  was  beginning  ""to  look  beyond  recovery  to  growth""." 

1	"Horror  film  heads  US  box  office  |||    A  low-budget  horror  film  produced  by  Evil  Dead  director  Sam  Raimi  has  topped  the  North  American  box  office.  |||    Boogeyman,  which  focuses  on  a  man  who  returns  to  his  childhood  home  to  confront  his  traumatic  past,  took  $19.5m  (£14.9m)  in  three  days.  Last  week's  chart-topper,  the  Robert  de  Niro  thriller  Hide  and  Seek,  fell  to  number  four.  Other  new  entries  included  The  Wedding  Date,  a  comedy  starring  Will  and  Grace's  Debra  Messing,  at  number  two.  |||    The  road-trip  comedy  Are  We  There  Yet?  and  multiple  Oscar  nominee  Million  Dollar  Baby  completed  the  top  five.  Other  Oscar  contenders,  including  The  Aviator  and  Sideways,  continued  to  perform  strongly  at  the  box  office.  The  Aviator  has  taken  $75m  (£40m)  so  far,  while  Sideways  has  taken  $46.8m  (£24.8m)  in  a  more  limited  release.  |||    Boogeyman,  which  cost  just  $7m  (£3.5m)  to  make,  performed  well  even  though  it  was  not  screened  to  critics  before  release  -  normally  a  sign  that  a  film  will  get  bad  reviews  or  perform  poorly  at  the  box  office.  ""I  certainly  believe  it's  a  genre  where  people  are  going  to  be  more  moved  by  the  marketing  materials  for  the  movie  than  by  what  the  critics  say,""  said  Rory  Bruer,  head  of  distribution  for  Sony  Pictures,  which  released  the  film  in  the  US.  Overall  the  weekend  box  office  was  strong  despite  the  fact  that  it  was  American  football's  Super  Bowl  weekend  -  a  time  when  cinema  admissions  generally  fall.  This  year,  the  top  12  films  grossed  around  $91m  (£48.3m),  compared  to  2004's  Super  Bowl  weekend  when  the  total  box  office  was  $73.4m  (£38.9m)." 

2	"Tories  outlining  policing  plans  |||    Local  communities  would  be  asked  to  go  to  the  polls  to  elect  their  own  area  police  commissioner,  under  plans  unveiled  by  the  Conservatives.  |||    Party  leader  Michael  Howard  said  the  new  role  would  replace  ""inconspicuous""  police  authorities.  He  said  the  new  office  would  not  supersede  the  job  of  a  chief  constable.  The  Lib  Dems  said  the  plan  could  let  extreme  groups  run  policing,  while  Labour  criticised  ""extravagant""  Tory  promises  on  policing.  |||    Responding  to  the  plans,  the  chairman  of  the  Police  Federation  of  England  and  Wales,  which  represents  rank  and  file  officers,  said  it  was  essential  operational  independence  was  retained.  |||    Jan  Berry  said:  ""It  is  a  service,  not  a  political  football  to  be  kicked  around  every  time  an  election  approaches.  ""These  plans  could  result  in  those  with  extreme  political  views  dictating  what  actually  happens  on  the  ground,""  she  warned.  Outlining  his  crime  manifesto,  Mr  Howard  said  elected  police  commissioners  would  be  more  accountable  than  police  authorities  which  are  made  up  of  local  councillors  and  magistrates.  ""The  commissioner  will  have  the  powers  which  existing  police  authorities  have,""  he  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme.  ""The  trouble  is,  and  it's  no  reflection  on  the  people  who  are  on  the  police  authority  -  they  are  good  people  -  but  hardly  anyone  knows  who  they  are.""  Mr  Howard  said  the  authorities  were  not  ""providing  the  local  accountability  that  we  want  to  see""  and  that  elected  police  commissioners  would  be  more  visible.  |||    Critics  fear  the  move  could  hand  control  of  the  police  to  single-issue  campaigners  who  would  ignore  the  needs  of  the  wider  community.  Lord  Harris,  who  sits  on  the  executive  of  Association  of  Police  Authorities,  said  the  plans  seemed  to  suggest  chief  constables  should  be  told  what  to  do  by  a  single  politician.  ""That  is  overturning  nearly  200  years  of  the  way  in  which  we  have  organised  policing  in  this  country  to  avoid  the  politicisation  of  policing  decisions,""  he  said.  |||    Liberal  Democrat  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  said  the  plan  was  dangerous  and  ""could  create  conflict  between  chief  constables  and  elected  officials"".  Mr  Oaten  said  local  people  had  too  little  control  over  policing  but  a  far  better  solution  would  be  for  elected  councillors  to  draw  up  a  ""minimum  policing  guarantee""  with  their  chief  constables.  A  Labour  Party  spokesman  criticised  Michael  Howard's  record,  saying  police  numbers  had  fallen  by  1,132  when  he  was  home  secretary.  He  said:  ""Today  the  Tories  are  making  more  extravagant  promises  on  the  police  without  making  clear  how  they  would  pay  for  them,  other  than  through  fantasy  savings  to  the  asylum  system.""  The  Tories  insists  the  commissioner  role  would  not  be  like  that  of  an  American  sheriff.  Other  Tory  law  and  order  plans  include  building  more  prisons  and  making  criminals  serve  full  jail  sentences."

Clark  is  scheduled  to  welcome  in  the  New  Year  on  the  ABC  network,  a  job  he  has  done  for  33  years.  The  presenter  said  that  he  is  ""hopeful""  of  getting  better  in  time  to  lead  the  festivities  in  New  York's  Times  Square.  Clark's  publicist  Paul  Shefrin  said  the  television  host  was  ""recovering""  and  there  was  no  cause  for  alarm.  Clark,  who  produces  the  Golden  Globe  and  American  Music  Awards,  disclosed  last  year  that  he  was  suffering  from  diabetes.  |||    His  popular  music  show  American  Bandstand  was  first  broadcast  in  1952,  and  attracted  an  audience  of  20  million  people  after  it  was  picked  up  by  ABC  in  1957.  The  long-running  weekly  series,  which  featured  guests  including  Elvis  Presley,  Buddy  Holly  and  Aretha  Frankin,  came  to  an  end  in  1989.  Clark  was  inducted  into  the  Rock  and  Roll  Hall  of  Fame  in  1993  for  his  contribution  to  the  music  industry.  He  has  also  been  responsible  for  television  series  such  as  TV  Bloopers,  Celebrity  Boxing  and  drama  American  Dreams.  Clark  is  also  expected  to  act  as  executive  producer  for  the  upcoming  Golden  Globe  Awards  ceremony,  which  is  taking  place  on  16  January."

She  also  carved  out  a  successful  television  career,  appearing  for  many  years  in  ITV's  well-loved  comedy  Bless  This  House.  Rowlands  died  in  Hove  on  Saturday  morning,  her  agent  said.  |||    Born  in  January  1934,  Rowlands  won  a  scholarship  to  the  Guildhall  School  of  Speech  and  Drama  scholarship  when  she  was  just  15.  |||    After  spending  several  years  at  the  Players  Theatre  in  London,  she  made  her  film  debut  in  1963  in  Tom  Jones,  directed  by  Tony  Richardson.  She  made  her  first  Carry  On  film  in  1969  where  she  appeared  in  Carry  On  Again  Doctor.  Rowlands  played  the  hard-done-by  wife  or  the  put-upon  employee  as  a  regular  Carry  On  star.  She  also  appeared  in  Carry  On  at  your  Convenience,  Carry  On  Matron  and  Carry  On  Loving,  as  well  as  others.  |||    In  recent  years  she  appeared  in  BBC  mini-series  The  Cazalets  and  played  Mrs  Potts  in  the  London  stage  version  of  Beauty  and  the  Beast.  Agent  Simon  Beresford  said:  ""She  was  just  an  absolutely  favourite  client  She  never  complained  about  anything,  particularly  when  she  was  ill,  she  was  an  old  trouper.  ""She  was  of  the  old  school  -  she  had  skills  from  musical  theatre  and  high  drama,  that  is  why  she  worked  with  the  great  and  the  good  of  directors.  ""She  didn't  mind  always  being  recognised  for  the  Carry  On  films  because  she  thoroughly  enjoyed  making  them.  She  was  a  really  lovely  person  and  she  will  be  much  missed.""

0	"Weak  data  buffets  French  economy  |||    A  batch  of  downbeat  government  data  has  cast  doubt  over  the  French  economy's  future  prospects.  |||    Official  figures  showed  on  Friday  that  unemployment  was  unchanged  at  9.9%  last  month,  while  consumer  confidence  fell  unexpectedly  in  October.  At  the  same  time,  finance  minister  Nicolas  Sarkozy  warned  that  high  oil  prices  posed  a  threat  to  French  growth.  ""[Oil  prices]  will  weigh  on  consumer  spending  in  the  short  term,  and  potentially  on  confidence,""  he  said.  World  oil  prices  have  risen  by  more  than  60%  since  the  start  of  the  year  as  production  struggles  to  keep  pace  with  soaring  demand.  |||    Analysts  said  French  companies,  keen  to  protect  their  profit  margins  at  a  time  of  rising  energy  costs,  were  reluctant  to  take  on  extra  staff.  ""[The  unemployment  figures]  show  the  main  problem  of  the  French  economy:  we  have  growth  but  without  an  improvement  in  employment,""  said  Marc  Touati,  an  economist  at  Natexis  Banques  Populaires.  ""Politicians  must  have  the  will  and  guts  to  solve  structural  unemployment  with  thorough  reforms,  otherwise  in  five  or  ten  years,  it  will  be  too  late.""  Obligatory  employer  contributions  to  worker  welfare  programmes  mean  that  it  costs  more  to  hire  staff  in  France  than  in  many  other  European  economies.  Many  economists  have  urged  the  government  to  stimulate  employment  by  reducing  non-wage  payroll  costs,  and  by  scrapping  restrictions  on  working  hours.  The  French  statistics  agency,  INSEE,  expects  the  economy  to  grow  by  about  2.4%  this  year,  buoyed  by  strong  consumer  spending  and  business  investment.  That  is  above  the  projected  eurozone  average  of  just  above  2%." 

2	"UKIP  candidate  suspended  in  probe  |||    Eurosceptic  party  UKIP  have  suspended  a  candidate  for  allegedly  suggesting  the  criminally  insane  should  be  killed.  |||    John  Houston,  54,  was  due  to  stand  in  the  East  Kilbride  seat  in  Lanarkshire  at  the  next  election.  But  he  was  suspended  after  his  reported  views,  including  the  return  of  the  British  Empire,  were  sent  to  two  Scottish  newspapers.  UKIP  spokesman  Mark  Croucher  said  those  who  selected  Mr  Houston  knew  nothing  of  his  views.  The  episode  comes  at  a  difficult  time  for  UKIP,  soon  after  the  high-profile  departure  of  MEP  Robert  Kilroy-Silk.  Mr  Houston  is  alleged  to  have  said  that  the  organs  of  the  criminally  insane  should  be  ""made  available  to  law-abiding  members  of  the  community""  and  proposed  the  legalisation  of  drugs  and  the  sex  trade.  The  document  reportedly  said:  ""We're  looking  for  the  resurrection  of  the  British  Empire.  ""The  problems  for  the  human  race  -  environmental  and  others  -  can  only  be  dealt  with  on  a  global  scale,  and  that  calls  for  a  radical  alliance  of  the  English-speaking  nations,  which  they  are  uniquely  able  to  do.""  Mr  Croucher  said  the  main  issue  would  be  that  Mr  Houston's  reported  views  had  been  presented  as  UKIP  policy,  which  they  were  not.  He  said  they  might  have  been  submissions  to  a  committee  working  on  the  party's  manifesto,  but  would  not  have  been  matched  to  Mr  Houston  when  he  was  standing  to  become  a  candidate.  He  told  BBC  News:  ""He  appears  to  have  said  these  things.  We  have  suspended  him  as  a  member  and  as  a  candidate.  ""By  all  accounts  none  of  this  was  mentioned  at  his  selection  meeting.  ""It  is  simply  a  distraction  from  the  task  in  hand,  the  EU  constitution,  not  individual  idiocies.""  Mr  Houston  was  quoted  in  the  Herald  newspaper  saying:  ""I  feel  UKIP  have  over-reacted  and  overshot  the  runway.""  |||    Peter  Nielson,  who  is  UKIP  Scotland  chairman,  said  he  had  suspended  Mr  Houston  on  Friday  night.  ""He  will  remain  suspended  while  the  matter  is  being  investigated  and  then  we  will  decide  if  and  what  further  action  will  be  taken.""  He  said  that  any  evidence  would  be  looked  into  and  Mr  Houston  may  be  interviewed  by  the  party.  He  added:  ""I  can't  comment  too  much  at  the  moment,  I  have  one  version  from  him  but  I  haven't  seen  the  papers  yet.""" 

1	"Aviator  'creator'  in  Oscars  snub  |||    The  man  who  said  he  got  Oscar-nominated  movie  The  Aviator  off  the  ground  and  signed  up  Leonardo  DiCaprio  has  been  shut  out  of  the  Academy  Awards  race.  |||    Charles  Evans  Jr  battled  over  his  role  with  the  people  who  eventually  made  the  film,  and  won  a  producer's  credit.  But  he  is  not  on  the  list  of  producers  who  can  win  a  best  film  Oscar  due  to  a  limit  on  the  number  of  nominees.  The  Oscars  organisers  have  picked  two  of  The  Aviator's  four  producers  to  be  nominated  for  best  film.  |||    Up  to  three  producers  can  be  named  per  film  but  the  studios  behind  The  Aviator  and  Million  Dollar  Baby  failed  to  trim  their  credits  -  so  the  Academy  of  Motion  Pictures  Arts  and  Sciences  (Ampas)  has  done  it  for  them.  The  Aviator's  nominated  producers  are  Michael  Mann  and  Graham  King  -  with  Mr  Evans  and  Sandy  Climan,  Mr  Mann's  former  deputy,  left  off.  Mr  Evans  sued  Mr  Mann  in  2001,  claiming  he  came  up  with  the  idea,  spent  years  developing  it  and  persuaded  DiCaprio  to  play  Hughes  -  but  said  he  was  later  excluded  from  the  project.  The  two  sides  settled  out  of  court  in  a  deal  that  has  remained  secret  apart  from  the  fact  Mr  Evans'  name  has  appeared  as  a  producer  when  the  film's  credits  roll.  At  the  Golden  Globes,  Mr  Evans  -  who  was  named  among  the  winners  when  the  film  won  best  drama  film  -  evaded  a  security  guard  to  have  his  photo  taken  with  DiCaprio,  director  Martin  Scorsese,  Mr  Mann  and  Mr  King.  |||    Ampas  decided  to  limit  the  number  of  producers  who  could  be  nominated  after  Shakespeare  in  Love's  victory  in  1999  saw  five  producers  collect  awards.  The  eligible  names  for  The  Aviator  and  Million  Dollar  Baby  were  decided  by  Ampas'  producers  branch  executive  committee  on  Wednesday.  The  decision  also  saw  Clint  Eastwood  get  his  third  personal  nomination  for  Million  Dollar  Baby.  He  is  now  named  in  the  best  film  category  as  well  as  being  nominated  for  best  director  and  best  lead  actor.  The  Academy  Awards  ceremony  will  be  held  in  Hollywood  on  27  February.  Chinese  actress  Ziyi  Zhang,  star  of  Crouching  Tiger,  Hidden  Dragon,  Hero  and  House  of  Flying  Daggers,  is  the  latest  name  to  be  added  to  the  list  of  presenters  on  the  night." 

2	"BAA  support  ahead  of  court  battle  |||    UK  airport  operator  BAA  has  reiterated  its  support  for  the  government's  aviation  expansion  plans  to  airports  throughout  the  country.  |||    The  comments  come  a  day  ahead  of  a  High  Court  challenge  by  residents'  groups  and  local  councils  to  the  government's  White  Paper.  The  judicial  review  will  centre  on  government  plans  for  expansion  at  Heathrow,  Stansted  and  Luton  airports.  BAA,  which  operates  all  three,  said  it  was  consulting  with  local  communities.  ""We  are...consulting  on  voluntary  compensation  schemes  which  go  beyond  our  statutory  obligations,""  a  BAA  spokesman  said.  |||    Groups  challenging  the  plans  include  Stop  Stansted  Expansion,  Heathrow  anti-noise  campaigners  HACAN  Clearskies  and  the  London  boroughs  of  Hillingdon  and  Wandsworth.  At  Heathrow,  Gatwick,  Edinburgh  and  Glasgow  airports,  BAA  launched  a  series  of  consultations  on  blight  to  properties  from  the  proposed  expansion  in  September  2004,  which  will  close  next  week.  The  company  is  also  offering  to  buy  noise-hit  properties  for  an  index-linked,  unblighted  price.  Among  other  measures,  BAA  has  set  up  a  homeowner  support  scheme  for  people  living  near  Stansted,  and  has  launched  a  special  scheme  for  those  close  to  the  airport  but  far  enough  away  not  to  be  covered  by  the  homeowner  scheme.  At  Heathrow,  BAA  said  it  was  working  closely  with  all  interested  parties  to  see  how  the  strict  environmental,  air  quality  and  noise  targets  for  a  third  runway  can  be  met.  |||    At  Gatwick,  the  company  has  written  to  homes  and  business  likely  to  be  affected  by  any  extra  runway.  Stop  Stansted  Expansion  said  the  White  Paper,  published  in  December  2003,  was  ""fundamentally  flawed""  and  did  not  follow  the  proper  consultation  process.  ""We  do  not  underestimate  the  scale  of  the  challenge  before  us  because  the  courts  have  never  before  overturned  a  government  White  Paper,""  said  Stop  Stansted  Expansion  chairman  Peter  Sanders  said.  HACAN  chairman  John  Stewart  said:  ""Almost  exactly  a  year  ago  the  government  published  its  30-year  aviation  White  Paper  with  much  fanfare.  ""It  hoped  that  would  be  the  end  of  the  debate  and  it  could  proceed  with  its  plans  for  a  massive  expansion  of  aviation.  ""Yet,  a  year  later  the  protesters  are  still  here,  and  stronger  than  ever.  ""  A  judgement  from  Mr  Justice  Sullivan  is  expected  early  in  February." 

1	"Deal  to  ban  'homophobic'  reggae  |||    The  reggae  industry  is  to  refuse  to  release  or  stage  concerts  featuring  homophobic  songs  under  a  global  deal  struck  with  gay  rights  groups.  |||    A  damaging  campaign  against  stars  such  as  Beenie  Man  and  Sizzla  has  been  waged  over  lyrics  that  allegedly  call  for  gay  people  to  be  killed  or  assaulted.  The  campaign,  which  led  to  gigs  being  scrapped  and  a  UK  police  investigation,  will  now  be  dropped  under  the  truce.  Brett  Lock  of  gay  group  OutRage!  said  they  were  ""wiping  the  slate  clean"".  The  protests  had  been  led  by  the  Stop  Murder  Music  coalition,  an  umbrella  group  including  OutRage!,  the  Black  Gay  Men's  Advisory  Group  and  Jamaican  movement  J-Flag.  |||    That  coalition  has  reached  a  verbal  agreement  with  major  dancehall  reggae  record  labels  and  concert  promoters  covering  eight  of  the  scene's  biggest  stars.  But  the  artists  themselves  were  not  involved  in  the  negotiations  and  have  not  directly  signed  up.  Instead,  the  record  companies  have  pledged  not  to  release  or  re-release  any  offensive  songs  -  many  of  which  date  back  a  number  of  years.  And  it  is  believed  promoters  will  make  stars  agree  not  to  perform  such  tunes  on  stage.  ""The  reggae  industry  will  work  with  the  artists  while  still  maintaining  their  freedom  of  speech  and  artistic  freedom,""  according  to  media  and  PR  strategist  Glen  Yearwood,  who  is  representing  the  reggae  industry.  |||    The  industry  would  halt  any  attempt  by  an  artist  to  perform  or  release  a  song  inciting  violence  against  any  group  or  gender,  he  said.  ""We'll  advise  them  this  is  not  the  way  forward  in  a  civilised  society.""  The  Stop  Murder  Music  campaign  saw  protesters  picket  gigs,  resulted  in  Sizzla's  UK  tour  being  cancelled  in  November,  forced  Mobo  award  organisers  to  drop  artists  from  nominations  and  saw  Beenie  Man  dropped  from  an  MTV  show  in  August.  Police  have  also  been  investigating  whether  lyrics  incite  the  assault  and  murder  of  gay  people.  The  campaign  was  a  blow  to  the  reggae  industry,  Mr  Yearwood  admitted.  ""If  you  can't  have  major  stars  touring,  then  you  don't  sell  many  albums,""  he  said.  |||    But  the  artists  -  Beenie  Man,  Sizzla,  Elephant  Man,  Buju  Banton,  Bounty  Killer,  TOK,  Capleton  and  Vybz  Kartel  -  will  not  have  to  apologise  for  past  songs  or  comments.  OutRage!'s  Mr  Lock  said:  ""The  main  players  in  the  dancehall  reggae  industry  will  attempt  to  regulate  the  industry  themselves  to  ensure  that  there  aren't  any  violently  homophobic  or  gay-bashing  lyrics  in  the  future.  ""As  a  gesture  of  good  faith,  the  Stop  Murder  Music  coalition  has  agreed  to  suspend  our  aggressive  campaigning  against  murder  music.  ""So  we  shall  not  be  picketing  concerts  or  calling  for  prosecutions  to  give  the  industry  the  space  to  regulate  and  reform  itself.""  Record  companies  VP  and  Greensleeves,  distributor  Jet  Star  and  concert  promoters  including  Jammins  and  Apollo  Entertainment  are  all  on  board."

I  don't  like  doing  this  at  all.  I'd  like  to  thank  my  family  for  being  really  supportive  and  everybody  that  made  my  record  with  me.""  ""I  don't  even  know  what  to  do  right  now.  Thank  you  all  you  guys  for  voting  for  me,  I  feel  sick  right  now.""  Viewers  of  digital  music  TV  channel  MTV  Base  voted  Stone  the  winner  in  the  best  urban  act  category.  Ms  Stone  also  performed  her  song  Right  To  Be  Wrong,  backed  by  a  gospel  choir,  at  the  25th  award  ceremony  at  London's  Earls  Court.  Her  second  album  Mind,  Body  &  Soul  reached  number  one  in  the  UK  charts  last  October  and  went  straight  into  the  US  charts  at  number  11.  |||    The  teenager  also  has  Grammy  nominations  in  the  US,  normally  dominated  by  home-grown  acts.  Born  Jocelyn  Stoker,  the  Devon  diva  started  her  career  in  a  BBC  talent  programme,  and  was  then  discovered  at  a  New  York  audition  by  a  US  record  executive,  Steve  Greenberg.  Indie  Rock  group  Muse  consists  of  Matthew  Bellamy,  Chris  Wolstenholme  and  Dominic  Howard  who  met  in  their  early  teens  in  Teignmouth,  south  Devon.  Dominic  Howard  said  of  winning:  ""We  love  playing  live,  it's  very  important  for  our  band.  So  to  win  something  like  this  really  feels  great.""  The  trio  met  aged  13  and  formed  the  band  Gothic  Plague,  changing  its  name  to  Fixed  Penalty,  Rocket  Baby  Dolls  and  finally  Muse.  The  band  released  its  first  self-titled  EP  in  1998.  The  third  studio  album,  Absolution,  was  released  in  2003,  providing  the  hit  singles  Time  Is  Running  Out,  Hysteria,  and  Butterflies  And  Hurricanes."

Under  new  European  age  discrimination  rules,  a  default  retirement  age  of  65  will  be  introduced.  Workers  will  be  permitted  to  request  staying  on  beyond  this  compulsory  retirement  age,  although  employers  will  have  the  right  to  refuse.  Trade  and  Industry  Secretary  Patricia  Hewitt  said  people  would  not  be  forced  to  work  longer  than  they  wanted,  saying  the  default  age  was  not  a  statutory,  compulsory  retirement  age.  She  said  employers  would  be  free  to  continue  employing  people  for  as  long  as  they  were  competent.  |||    Under  age  discrimination  proposals  from  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  last  year  workers  were  to  be  allowed  to  work  on  till  70  if  they  wished.  |||    Business  leaders  had  opposed  the  plan  as  they  said  it  would  be  too  costly  and  cumbersome.  The  British  Chambers  of  Commerce  welcomed  the  latest  proposal.  ""This  move  today  is  the  best  of  both  worlds,""  it  said.  ""Employers  have  the  ability  to  define  the  end  point  of  the  employer-employee  relationship  and  employees  have  flexibility  with  a  right  to  request  to  work  past  the  age  of  65.""  But  Age  Concern  said  imposing  a  retirement  age  of  65  was  ""cowardly""  and  a  ""complete  u-turn"".  ""This  makes  a  mockery  of  the  Government's  so-called  commitment  to  outlawing  ageism,  leaving  the  incoming  age  discrimination  law  to  unravel,""  said  Gordon  Lishman,  director  general  of  Age  Concern  England  .  ""It  is  now  inevitable  that  older  people  will  mount  legal  challenges  to  the  decision  using  European  law.""  The  decision  will  have  no  impact  on  the  age  at  which  workers  can  collect  their  state  pension,  the  government  has  said." 

2	"Howard  rejects  BNP's  claim  |||    Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  has  dismissed  claims  that  his  immigration  policy  was  ""moving  onto  the  turf""  of  the  British  National  Party  (BNP).  |||    BNP  leader  Nick  Griffin  told  the  Independent  he  expected  some  BNP  voters  to  switch  to  the  Tories  over  the  issue.  But  Mr  Howard  said  he  rejected  the  idea  that  the  Tories  and  BNP  appealed  to  the  same  voting  instincts.  Asked  if  he  would  welcome  BNP  voters  he  told  the  BBC:  ""I  don't  want  anybody  to  vote  for  these  extremist  parties"".  He  added,  on  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""If  you  want  good  community  relations  in  this  country...then  you  have  to  have  firm,  fair  immigration  controls.""  |||    The  Tories  have  promised  an  upper  limit  on  the  number  of  people  allowed  into  Britain  with  the  slogan:  ""It's  not  racist  to  impose  limits  on  immigration"".  All  parties  are  stepping  up  campaiging  in  the  run-up  to  the  general  election,  widely  expected  to  be  called  for  5  May.  Labour  has  unveiled  its  own  ""points  system""  for  ensuring  migrants  who  want  to  work  in  the  UK  have  skills  that  are  required,  but  have  rejected  immigration  quotas.  The  Liberal  Democrats  have  warned  both  parties  against  ""pandering  to  prejudice"".  |||    Mr  Griffin  told  the  Independent  the  Tories'  plans  were  ""a  definite  move  onto  our  turf"".  He  said:  ""I  quite  freely  accept  that  on  a  nationwide  basis,  the  Tories  will  con  enough  people  to  make  a  significant  hole  in  our  vote.""  Asked  whether  he  was  comfortable  with  the  perception  that  the  Conservatives  and  the  BNP  appeal  to  the  same  voting  instincts,  Mr  Howard  told  the  BBC:  ""I  reject  that  entirely"".  He  said  he  found  BNP's  policies  ""abhorrent""  but  he  said  the  UK  had  to  take  a  different  approach  to  immigration,  which  he  said  was  out  of  control.  ""The  government  doesn't  want  to  limit  it  in  any  way,  we  do,  there's  a  legitimate  difference  between  us  there  which  we  can  discuss  in  a  calm,  rational  and  reasonable  way,""  he  said.  He  again  rejected  newspaper  speculation  that  his  own  father  entered  Britain  illegally." 

2	"Royal  couple  watch  nation's  mood  |||    Prince  Charles  and  Camilla  Parker  Bowles  are  awaiting  the  nation's  reaction  after  announcing  they  are  to  be  married  on  8  April.  |||    Mrs  Parker  Bowles  will  take  the  title  HRH  Duchess  of  Cornwall  after  a  civil  ceremony  to  be  held  at  Windsor  Castle.  A  Daily  Telegraph  poll  of  1,313  people  suggests  two-thirds  of  Britons  support  the  couple's  decision  to  marry.  But  only  40%  think  Mrs  Parker  Bowles  should  become  Princess  Consort  as  planned  after  Charles  becomes  king.  Some  47%  believe  she  should  have  no  title,  while  7%  think  she  should  become  queen.  |||    The  poll  also  found  that  the  majority  of  Britons  would  prefer  the  monarchy  to  miss  a  generation,  with  the  Queen  handing  the  throne  to  her  grandson  Prince  William,  22,  on  her  death  or  abdication.  On  Thursday  night,  Prince  Charles,  56,  and  Mrs  Parker  Bowles,  57,  hosted  a  dinner  at  Windsor  Castle,  their  first  public  appearance  since  announcing  their  engagement.  Mrs  Parker  Bowles  said  the  prince  went  down  on  one  knee  to  propose  and  added:  ""I'm  just  coming  down  to  earth.""  She  displayed  her  diamond  engagement  ring  -  a  Royal  Family  heirloom  -  to  reporters.  Charles  said  he  and  his  wife-to-be  were  ""absolutely  delighted"".  Their  marriage  will  end  years  of  speculation  on  a  relationship  which  dates  back  to  1970.  |||    The  Queen  and  Duke  of  Edinburgh  said  the  news  had  made  them  ""very  happy"".  Princes  William  and  Harry  said  they  are  ""very  happy""  and  wish  the  couple  ""all  the  luck  in  the  future"".  The  wedding  will  be  a  civil  ceremony  followed  by  a  service  of  prayer  and  dedication  in  St  George's  Chapel  at  which  the  Archbishop  of  Canterbury,  Dr  Rowan  Williams,  will  preside.  |||    The  marriage  is  likely  to  be  a  sensitive  issue  because  Mrs  Parker  Bowles  is  divorced  and  her  former  husband  is  still  alive.  If  he  became  king,  Charles  would  be  the  supreme  governor  of  the  Church  of  England  and  some  Anglicans  remain  opposed  to  the  remarriage  of  divorcees.  ""His  divorce  from  Diana  and  the  disappointment  the  country  felt  over  how  Diana  had  been  treated...  opened  up  a  sense  of  disillusionment  with  [Prince  Charles],""  said  Ros  Coward,  who  wrote  the  authorised  biography  of  Diana,  princess  of  Wales.  The  Archbishop  of  Canterbury  said:  ""I  am  pleased  that  Prince  Charles  and  Mrs  Camilla  Parker  Bowles  have  decided  to  take  this  important  step.""  Tony  Blair  said  he  was  ""delighted""  for  the  couple  and  offered  his  congratulations,  as  did  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard  and  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy.  Australia's  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  also  offered  his  congratulations,  adding  that  their  decision  to  marry  was  a  ""sensible  and  a  good  thing"".  Mrs  Parker  Bowles  has  joined  the  prince  at  numerous  engagements  in  recent  years  -  mostly  at  evening  events  for  The  Prince's  Trust.  Clarence  House  staff  were  at  pains  to  point  out  that  she  attended  these  events  in  a  private  capacity." 

0	"Giant  waves  damage  S  Asia  economy  |||    Governments,  aid  agencies,  insurers  and  travel  firms  are  among  those  counting  the  cost  of  the  massive  earthquake  and  waves  that  hammered  southern  Asia.  |||    The  worst-hit  areas  are  Sri  Lanka,  India,  Indonesia  and  Thailand,  with  at  least  23,000  people  killed.  Early  estimates  from  the  World  Bank  put  the  amount  of  aid  needed  at  about  $5bn  (£2.6bn),  similar  to  the  cash  offered  Central  America  after  Hurricane  Mitch.  Mitch  killed  about  10,000  people  and  caused  damage  of  about  $10bn  in  1998.  World  Bank  spokesman  Damien  Milverton  told  the  Wall  Street  Journal  that  he  expected  an  aid  package  of  financing  and  debt  relief.  |||    Tourism  is  a  vital  part  of  the  economies  of  the  stricken  countries,  providing  jobs  for  19  million  people  in  the  south  east  Asian  region,  according  to  the  World  Travel  and  Tourism  Council  (WTTC).  In  the  Maldives  islands,  in  the  Indian  ocean,  two-thirds  of  all  jobs  depend  on  tourism.  |||    But  the  damage  covers  fishing,  farming  and  businesses  too,  with  hundreds  of  thousands  of  buildings  and  small  boats  destroyed  by  the  waves.  International  agencies  have  pledged  their  support;  most  say  it  is  impossible  to  gauge  the  extent  of  the  damage  yet.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  has  promised  rapid  action  to  help  the  governments  of  the  stricken  countries  cope.  |||    ""The  IMF  stands  ready  to  do  its  part  to  assist  these  nations  with  appropriate  support  in  their  time  of  need,""  said  managing  director  Rodrigo  Rato.  Only  Sri  Lanka  and  Bangladesh  currently  receive  IMF  support,  while  Indonesia,  the  quake's  epicentre,  has  recently  graduated  from  IMF  assistance.  It  is  up  to  governments  to  decide  if  they  want  IMF  help.  Other  agencies,  such  as  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  have  said  that  it  is  too  early  to  comment  on  the  amount  of  aid  needed.  There  is  no  underestimating  the  size  of  the  problem,  however.  The  United  Nations'  emergency  relief  coordinator,  Jan  Egeland,  said  that  ""this  may  be  the  worst  national  disaster  in  recent  history  because  it  is  affecting  so  many  heavily  populated  coastal  areas...  so  many  vulnerable  communities.  ""Many  people  will  have  [had]  their  livelihoods,  their  whole  future  destroyed  in  a  few  seconds.""  He  warned  that  ""the  longer  term  effects  many  be  as  devastating  as  the  tidal  wave  or  the  tsunami  itself""  because  of  the  risks  of  epidemics  from  polluted  drinking  water.  |||    Insurers  are  also  struggling  to  assess  the  cost  of  the  damage,  but  several  big  players  believe  the  final  bill  is  likely  to  be  less  than  the  $27bn  cost  of  the  hurricanes  that  battered  the  US  earlier  this  year.  |||    ""The  region  that's  affected  is  very  big  so  we  have  to  check  country-by-country  what  the  situation  is"",  said  Serge  Troeber,  deputy  head  of  the  natural  disasters  department  at  Swiss  Re,  the  world's  second  biggest  reinsurance  firm.  ""I  should  assume,  however,  that  the  overall  dimension  of  insured  damages  is  below  the  storm  damages  of  the  US,""  he  said.  Munich  Re,  the  world's  biggest  reinsurer,  said:  ""This  is  primarily  a  human  tragedy.  It  is  too  early  for  us  to  state  what  our  financial  burden  will  be.""  Allianz  has  said  it  sees  no  significant  impact  on  its  profitability.  However,  a  low  insurance  bill  may  simply  reflect  the  general  poverty  of  much  of  the  region,  rather  than  the  level  of  economic  devastation  for  those  who  live  there.  |||    The  International  Federation  of  the  Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent  Societies  told  the  Reuters  news  agency  that  it  was  seeking  $6.5m  for  emergency  aid.  |||    ""The  biggest  health  challenges  we  face  is  the  spread  of  waterborne  diseases,  particularly  malaria  and  diarrhoea,""  the  aid  agency  was  quoted  as  saying.  The  European  Union  has  said  it  will  deliver  3m  euros  (£2.1m;  $4.1m)  of  aid,  according  to  the  Wall  Street  Journal.  The  EU's  Humanitarian  Aid  Commissioner,  Louis  Michel,  was  quoted  as  saying  that  it  was  key  to  bring  aid  ""in  those  vital  hours  and  days  immediately  after  the  disaster"".  Other  countries  also  are  reported  to  have  pledged  cash,  while  the  US  State  Department  said  it  was  examining  what  aid  was  needed  in  the  region.  Getting  companies  and  business  up  and  running  also  may  play  a  vital  role  in  helping  communities  recover  from  the  weekend's  events.  |||    Many  of  the  worst-hit  areas,  such  as  Sri  Lanka,  Thailand's  Phuket  island  and  the  Maldives,  are  popular  tourist  resorts  that  are  key  to  local  economies.  |||    December  and  January  are  two  of  the  busiest  months  for  the  travel  in  southern  Asia  and  the  damage  will  be  even  more  keenly  felt  as  the  industry  was  only  just  beginning  to  emerge  from  a  post  9/11  slump.  Growth  has  been  rapid  in  southeast  Asia,  with  the  World  Tourism  Organisation  figures  showing  a  45%  increase  in  tourist  revenues  in  the  region  during  the  first  10  months  of  2004.  In  southern  Asia  that  expansion  is  23%.  ""India  continues  to  post  excellent  results  thanks  to  increased  promotion  and  product  development,  but  also  to  the  upsurge  in  business  travel  driven  by  the  rapid  economic  development  of  the  country,""  the  WTO  said.  ""Arrivals  to  other  destinations  such  as...  Maldives  and  Sri  Lanka  also  thrived.""  In  Thailand,  tourism  accounts  for  about  6%  of  the  country's  annual  gross  domestic  product,  or  about  $8bn.  In  Singapore  the  figure  is  close  to  5%.  Tourism  also  brings  in  much  needed  foreign  currency.  In  the  short-term,  however,  travel  companies  are  cancelling  flights  and  trips.  That  has  hit  shares  across  Asia  and  Europe,  with  investors  saying  that  earnings  and  economic  growth  are  likely  to  slow." 

1	"Rapper  Kanye  West's  shrewd  soul  |||    US  hip-hop  star  Kanye  West  -  who  leads  the  race  for  this  year's  Grammys  with  10  nominations  -  rose  to  prominence  by  producing  songs  for  artists  such  as  Jay-Z  and  Alicia  Keys.  |||    He  then  emerged  from  his  behind-the-scenes  role  to  become  an  artist  as  well  as  a  producer.  But  his  solo  career  almost  ended  before  it  began  after  a  near-fatal  car  crash  left  West  with  his  jaw  wired  shut  in  2002.  The  resulting  song,  Through  the  Wire,  became  West's  first  UK  hit  in  April  2004  and  subsequent  album  The  College  Dropout  became  a  transatlantic  success,  both  critically  and  commercially.  West,  26,  began  rapping  as  a  teenager  at  his  Chicago  school,  inspired  by  the  beats  and  rhymes  of  1980s  pioneers  Run  DMC.  |||    Hip-hop  producer  No  ID  encouraged  West  to  sample  old  soul  and  R&B  hits  then  revive  them  with  an  updated  sound,  an  approach  that  would  become  his  trademark.  ""I  feel  like  a  lot  of  the  soul  that's  in  those  old  records  that  I  sample  is  in  me,""  he  said.  ""So  when  I  hear  them  and  I  put  them  with  the  drums  and  I  bring  them  to  the  new  millennium,  it's  just  like  God's  doing  that.  I'm  one  with  them  records  right  there.  It's  a  blessing.""  |||    Leaving  his  Chicago  art  school  after  only  one  year  -  a  move  which  would  later  inspire  the  title  of  his  album  -  West  began  his  music  career  co-producing  songs  for  artists  Mase  and  the  Madd  Rapper.  This  drew  the  attention  of  superstar  rapper  Jay-Z,  who  signed  West  up  to  his  Roc-A-Fella  record  label  to  produce  numerous  artists  on  his  roster.  West's  work  gained  mainstream  recognition  when  he  produced  the  singles  Takeover  and  Izzo  (HOVA)  on  Jay-Z's  own  2001  album  Blueprint.  Incorporating  samples  of  Five  to  One  by  The  Doors  and  the  Jackson  Five's  I  Want  You  Back  respectively,  the  hits  were  credited  with  injecting  soul  back  into  hip-hop.  |||    As  their  success  attracted  further  production  work  for  Jay-Z  ('03  Bonnie  &  Clyde)  and  artists  such  as  Ludacris  (Stand  Up)  and  Alicia  Keys  (You  Don't  Know  My  Name),  West  announced  plans  for  a  solo  album.  Driving  home  from  a  late-night  Los  Angeles  recording  session  in  October  2002,  he  was  involved  in  the  car  crash  that  left  his  jaw  fractured  in  three  places.  ""Anytime  I  hear  about  any  accident  my  heart  sinks  in  and  I  just  thank  God  that  I'm  still  here,""  he  later  said.  ""That  steering  wheel  could  have  been  two  inches  further  out,  and  that  would  have  been  it.""  |||    West's  account  of  the  accident  sampled  Chaka  Khan's  hit  Through  the  Fire  to  become  the  heart  of  his  completed  solo  album  The  College  Dropout.  Released  last  year,  it  was  by  turns  smooth,  humorous  and  sharp  and  largely  avoided  the  clich&#233;d  hip-hop  preoccupation  with  guns,  girls  and  jewellery.  |||    Through  the  Wire  was  quickly  joined  in  the  UK  and  US  charts  by  Slow  Jamz,  on  which  West  collaborated  with  rapper  Twista  and  Ray  actor  Jamie  Foxx.  The  College  Dropout  spawned  two  further  UK  hits  and  a  string  of  award  nominations.  West  was  shortlisted  for  10  Grammys  -  including  nominations  for  artist  and  album  of  the  year  -  and  took  the  best  hip-hop  artist,  producer  and  album  titles  at  last  year's  Music  of  Black  Origin  (Mobo)  Awards.  Now  a  respected  rapper  and  producer  in  the  influential  field  of  hip-hop,  Kanye  West  is  unlikely  to  regret  his  decision  to  leave  college  early." 

2	"Mayor  will  not  retract  Nazi  jibe  |||    London  mayor  Ken  Livingstone  has  again  refused  to  retract  a  Nazi  insult  made  to  a  Jewish  reporter.  |||    Labour's  Mr  Livingstone,  who  says  he  is  ""standing  by""  his  remarks,  had  accused  an  Evening  Standard  journalist  of  being  like  a  ""concentration  camp  guard"".  At  his  weekly  press  conference  on  Tuesday  he  said  his  comments  were  not  racist  and  refused  to  apologise.  He  said  to  media  representatives:  ""If  you  think  they  are  racist,  I  think  you  are  wrong.""  The  mayor  said  his  comments  would  not  affect  the  2012  Olympic  bid  and  added  that  his  determination  to  stand  up  for  what  he  believed  in  may  impress  bid  chiefs,  who  arrived  in  London  on  Tuesday.  ""I  think  it  is  important  that  the  IOC  (International  Olympic  Committee)  members  realise  that  when  we  get  the  games...they  have  a  mayor  who  is  not  going  to  panic,  change  course  or  get  in  a  great  flap  but  will  deliver  the  games  on  time  and  to  budget,""  he  said.  |||    On  Tuesday,  the  mayor  said  he  would  be  making  a  full  written  response  to  the  chairman  of  the  assembly.  Two  motions  were  passed  by  the  London  Assembly,  which  is  made  up  of  25  members  elected  to  examine  the  mayor's  activities,  on  Monday  asking  him  to  apologise  and  withdraw  his  comments.  The  mayor  said  he  had  recounted  to  the  assembly  a  number  of  ""examples  of  intrusion  by  journalists""  into  his,  and  his  family's  private  life.  ""I  don't  suggest  for  one  minute  that  has  anything  to  do  with  the  Holocaust  which  was  uniquely  the  most  evil  chapter  in  history.  ""But  when  reporters  say  to  me  I'm  only  doing  this  because  it's  my  job...  that's  the  same  abdication  of  moral  responsibility  at  the  thin  end  of  the  wedge  that  in  its  most  extreme  and  horrific  version  ends  up  with  others  being  prepared  to  stand  as  a  concentration  camp  guard.  |||    ""We  are  responsible  for  our  own  choices  in  this  life,  I  always  have  been  and  so  have  reporters.""  An  official  complaint  has  been  made  to  local  government  watchdogs  by  the  Board  of  Deputies  of  British  Jews,  demanding  an  investigation  by  the  Standards  Board  of  England.  It  has  the  power  to  suspended  or  bar  him  from  office  but  Mr  Livingstone  said:  ""There  must  have  been  20  instances  like  this  over  the  last  24  years.  |||    ""I  have  never  in  response  to  any  of  that  modified  a  policy  I  believed  to  be  right  or  modified  a  position  I  believed  to  be  right  and  I  don't  intend  to  now.  ""Because  if  I  do  that  effectively  you  hand  power  over  your  policies  and  position  to  the  editors  of  papers.""  On  tape  Mr  Livingstone,  who  once  worked  as  a  freelance  restaurant  critic  on  the  paper,  is  heard  asking  reporter  Oliver  Finegold  if  he  is  a  ""German  war  criminal"".  Mr  Finegold  replies:  ""No,  I'm  Jewish,  I  wasn't  a  German  war  criminal.  I'm  quite  offended  by  that.""  The  mayor  then  says:  ""Ah  right,  well  you  might  be,  but  actually  you  are  just  like  a  concentration  camp  guard,  you  are  just  doing  it  because  you  are  paid  to,  aren't  you?"""

He  objected  to  subsidies  on  agriculture  that  make  it  hard  for  developing  nations  like  India  to  compete.  He  also  called  for  reform  of  the  United  Nations,  the  World  Bank  and  the  IMF.  |||    Palaniappan  Chidambaram,  India's  finance  minister,  argued  that  these  organisations  need  to  take  into  account  the  changing  world  order,  given  India  and  China's  integration  into  the  global  economy.  He  said  the  issue  is  not  globalisation  but  ""the  terms  of  engagement  in  globalisation.""  Mr  Chidambaram  is  attending  the  G7  meeting  as  part  of  the  G20  group  of  nations,  which  account  for  two  thirds  of  the  world's  population.  At  a  conference  on  developing  enterprise  hosted  by  UK  finance  minister  Gordon  Brown  on  Friday,  he  said  that  he  was  in  favour  of  floating  exchange  rates  because  they  help  countries  cope  with  economic  shocks.  ""A  flexible  exchange  rate  is  one  more  channel  for  absorbing  both  positive  and  negative  shocks,""  he  told  the  conference.  India,  along  with  China,  Brazil,  South  Africa  and  Russia,  has  been  invited  to  take  part  in  the  G7  meeting  taking  place  in  London  on  Friday  and  Saturday.  China  is  expected  to  face  renewed  pressure  to  abandon  its  fixed  exchange  rate,  which  G7  nations,  in  particular  the  US,  have  blamed  for  a  surge  in  cheap  Chinese  exports.  ""Some  countries  have  tried  to  use  fixed  exchange  rates.  I  do  not  wish  to  make  any  judgements,""  Mr  Chidambaram  said.  Separately,  the  IMF  warned  on  Thursday  that  India's  budget  deficit  was  too  large  and  would  hamper  the  country's  economic  growth,  which  it  forecast  to  be  around  6.5%  in  the  year  to  March  2005.  In  the  year  to  March  2004,  the  Indian  economy  grew  by  8.5%."

Davis,  whose  65-year  career  included  credits  as  a  producer,  director,  actor  and  writer  for  stage  and  screen,  was  also  a  civil  rights  activist.  Miami  Beach  police  spokesman  Bobby  Hernandez  said  the  cause  of  death  appeared  to  be  natural.  |||    Davis's  body  was  discovered  by  his  grandson  and  paramedics  at  the  Shore  Club  hotel  in  Miami  Beach,  where  the  actor  had  been  shooting  the  film  Retirement.  Mr  Hernandez  said:  ""After  gaining  entry,  they  found  Mr  Davis  had  passed  away.  ""The  cause  of  death  appears  to  be  natural.  According  to  his  grandson  he  was  suffering  from  heart  disease.""  Some  of  Davis's  best  known  roles  included  The  Joe  Louis  Story  and  Gone  Are  the  Days  -  a  film  he  adapted  from  his  own  play,  Purlie  Victorious.  He  also  appeared  in  7  Spike  Lee  movies,  including  School  Daze,  Do  the  Right  Thing  and  Jungle  Fever.  |||    His  film  debut,  in  1950,  was  in  the  film  No  Way  Out,  starring  Sydney  Poitier  and  Ruby  Dee.  Davis  and  Dee  were  married  for  more  than  56  years  and  together  received  Kennedy  Center  honours  in  2004  for  their  body  of  work.  The  Actors'  Equity  Association  issued  a  statement  calling  Davis  ""an  icon  in  the  American  theatre""  and  he  and  Dee  ""American  treasures"".  Davis  was  also  a  prominent  figure  in  the  civil  rights  movement  and  was  a  voice  for  racial  equality.

He  said  Mr  Kilroy-Silk  had  made  him  deputy  party  leader  of  Veritas,  Latin  for  truth.  Sources  close  to  Mr  Hockney  said  around  eight  other  members  of  London  UKIP  were  also  planning  to  jump  ship.  |||    Details  of  the  coming  week's  events  were  hammered  out  at  a  meeting  at  Mr  Kilroy-Silk's  Buckinghamshire  home  on  Sunday,  the  BBC  News  Website  was  told.  The  news  came  after  UKIP  suspended  a  candidate  for  allegedly  suggesting  the  criminally  insane  should  be  killed.  John  Houston,  54,  was  due  to  stand  in  the  East  Kilbride  seat  in  Lanarkshire  at  the  next  election.  A  spokesman  for  UKIP  called  on  Mr  Hockney  to  quit  the  London  Assembly.  UKIP  asserts  that  Mr  Hockney  ""has  a  moral  obligation,  if  not  a  legal  one""  to  stand  down.  Mr  Hockney  meanwhile  told  the  BBC:  ""I  believe  that  Robert  Kilroy-Silk  can  deliver  better  as  a  leader  of  a  eurosceptic  party  than  the  current  leadership  of  the  UK  Independence  Party.""  |||    On  the  suspension  of  Mr  Houston,  UKIP  said  those  who  selected  him  knew  nothing  of  his  views.  Mr  Houston  is  alleged  to  have  said  that  the  organs  of  the  criminally  insane  should  be  ""made  available  to  law-abiding  members  of  the  community""  and  proposed  the  legalisation  of  drugs  and  the  sex  trade.  |||    The  document  reportedly  said:  ""We're  looking  for  the  resurrection  of  the  British  Empire.  ""The  problems  for  the  human  race  -  environmental  and  others  -  can  only  be  dealt  with  on  a  global  scale,  and  that  calls  for  a  radical  alliance  of  the  English-speaking  nations,  which  they  are  uniquely  able  to  do.""  UKIP  spokesman  Mark  Croucher  said  the  main  issue  would  be  that  Mr  Houston's  reported  views  had  been  presented  as  UKIP  policy,  which  they  were  not."

The  sound  of  a  mobile  phone  or  a  pager  can  result  in  a  strong  rebuke  from  either  the  Speaker  or  his  deputies.  The  Speaker  chairs  debates  in  the  Commons  and  is  charged  with  ensuring  order  in  the  chamber  and  enforcing  rules  and  conventions  of  the  House.

Russia's  newspapers  claimed  that  Baikal  was  a  front  for  gas  monopoly  Gazprom,  which  had  been  expected  to  win.  The  sale  has  destroyed  Yukos,  once  the  owner  of  Yuganskneftegas,  said  founder  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky.  ""Yuganskneftegas  has  been  sold  in  the  best  traditions  of  the  90s.  The  authorities  have  made  themselves  a  wonderful  Christmas  present  -  Russia's  most  efficient  oil  company  has  been  destroyed,""  the  Interfax  news  agency  quoted  Mr  Khodorkovsky  as  saying  via  his  lawyers.  |||    Gazprom  had  been  expected  to  win  the  auction  but  is  thought  to  have  failed  to  get  finance  for  the  deal  after  a  US  court  injunction  barred  it  from  taking  part.  Last  week,  Yukos  filed  for  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  protection  in  the  US  in  a  last-ditch  attempt  to  hang  on  to  Yuganskneftegas,  which  accounts  for  60%  of  its  output.  A  US  judge  banned  Gazprom  from  taking  part  in  the  auction  and  barred  international  banks  from  providing  the  firm  with  cash.  ""They  screwed  up  the  financing,""  said  Ronald  Smith,  an  analyst  at  Renaissance  Capital  in  Moscow.  ""And  Gazprom  doesn't  have  this  sort  of  money  lying  around.""  |||    Gazprom  has  denied  that  it  is  behind  the  purchase.  ""It  is  a  front  for  somebody  but  not  necessarily  for  Gazprom,""  said  Oleg  Maximov,  an  analyst  at  Troika  Dialog  in  Moscow.  ""We  don't  know  if  this  company  is  linked  100%  to  Gazprom.  |||    ""We  tried  to  find  it,  but  we  couldn't  and  as  far  as  I  know,  the  papers  had  the  same  result.""  The  sale  has  however  bought  time  for  Gazprom  to  raise  the  money  needed  for  the  purchase,  analysts  said.  One  scenario  is  that  Baikal  will  not  pay  when  it  is  supposed  to  in  two  weeks  time,  putting  Yuganskneftegas  back  in  the  hands  of  bailiffs  and  back  within  the  reach  of  Gazprom.  Yukos  is  not  planning  on  letting  go  of  its  unit  without  a  fight  and  has  threatened  legal  action  against  any  buyer.  Menatep,  Yukos  main  shareholders'  group,  has  also  threatened  legal  action.  Yukos  claims  that  it  is  being  punished  for  the  political  ambitions  of  its  founder,  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky,  who  is  now  in  jail  facing  separate  fraud  charges.  It  has  been  hit  with  more  than  $27bn  in  taxes  and  fines  and  many  observers  now  say  that  the  break  up  of  the  firm  that  accounts  for  20%  of  Russia's  oil  output  is  inevitable."

With  its  shares  closing  Tuesday  at  873p,  Bracknell-based  Exel  is  currently  valued  at  £2.6bn  ($6.3bn).  |||    Exel  employs  109,000  people  in  more  than  120  countries  and  has  itself  been  active  in  the  consolidation  of  the  logistics  sector,  paying  £328m  to  buy  fellow  UK  firm  Tibbett  &  Britten  last  August.  Its  customers  include  Boots,  Burberry,  Mothercare  and  consumer  products  giant  Procter  &  Gamble.  Andrew  Beh,  of  brokers  ING,  said  UPS  and  Deutsche  Post  were  the  most  likely  bidders  and  an  offer  of  950p  a  share  would  be  fair  if  a  bidding  battle  did  not  break  out.  ""It's  a  great  strategic  fit  for  both  companies,""  he  said.  ""Both  are  interested  in  expanding  in  logistics  and  you  can  make  a  decent  case  for  cost  synergies  which  could  justify  the  premium  and  that's  before  you  make  any  argument  about  revenue  synergies.""" 

2	"Nat  Insurance  to  rise,  say  Tories  |||    National  Insurance  will  be  raised  if  Labour  wins  the  next  election,  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  has  claimed.  |||    Tony  Blair  has  said  he  does  not  want  higher  tax  rates  for  top  earners  but  on  Wednesday  said  other  tax  promises  would  be  left  to  Labour's  manifesto.  Prime  minister's  questions  also  saw  Mr  Blair  predict  that  new  plans  would  probably  cut  net  immigration.  He  attacked  Tory  plans  to  process  asylum  claims  abroad  -  but  Mr  Howard  said  Labour  had  proposed  the  idea  too.  |||    The  Commons  questions  session  again  saw  the  leaders  of  the  two  biggest  parties  shape  up  for  the  forthcoming  election  campaign.  The  Tories  have  promised  £4bn  in  tax  cuts  but  have  yet  to  say  where  they  will  fall.  Mr  Howard  pointed  to  the  Institute  for  Fiscal  Studies'  predictions  that  Labour  will  need  to  increase  taxes  to  cover  an  £11bn  gap  in  its  spending  plans.  He  accused  ministers  of  wasting  money  on  unsuccessful  attempts  to  curb  bad  behaviour  and  truancy  in  schools  and  on  slow  asylum  processing.  It  was  no  good  Mr  Blair  claiming  tax  pledges  were  being  left  to  the  manifesto  as  he  had  given  one  to  MPs  on  Tuesday  about  the  top  rate  of  income  tax,  argued  Mr  Howard.  Pointing  to  national  insurance,  he  added:  ""Everyone  knows  tax  will  go  up  under  Labour:  isn't  it  now  clear  which  tax  it  would  be?""  |||    Mr  Blair  instead  hailed  Labour's  achievement  in  using  a  strong  economy  to  invest  in  public  services.  ""When  we  have  money  not  only  going  into  extra  teachers  and  nurses  but  equipment  in  schools  and  hospitals,  that  money  is  not  wasted,""  he  said.  On  the  tax  questions,  he  added:  ""We  will  make  commitments  on  tax  at  the  time  of  the  manifesto.""  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  this  week  published  plans  for  a  new  points  system  for  economic  migrants,  with  only  high-skilled  workers  allowed  into  the  UK  from  outside  the  European  Union.  |||    Mr  Blair  said  abuses  would  be  weeded  out  and  chain  migration,  where  families  automatically  get  the  right  to  settle  with  immigrant  workers,  would  end.  That  would  probably  create  a  fall  in  the  migrant  numbers,  he  said.  The  prime  minister  ridiculed  the  Tory  plans  for  asylum  quotas  and  for  processing  all  asylum  claims  overseas.  He  challenged  the  Tories  on  which  country  would  house  their  processing  centres  -  what  he  called  a  ""fantasy  island"".  Mr  Howard  read  from  a  letter  about  the  government's  own  plans  at  the  European  Council  of  Ministers  for  processing  asylum  seekers  outside  the  EU.  But  Mr  Blair  said:  ""All  the  other  countries  could  not  agree  on  the  way  forward,  nor  could  the  UN."""

Analysts  believe  other  sporting  goods  companies  may  now  take  a  closer  look  at  Rossignol,  prompting  an  auction  and  pushing  the  sale  price  higher.

European  sporting  goods  companies  have  seen  foreign  revenues  squeezed  by  a  slump  in  the  value  of  the  US  dollar,  making  a  takeover  more  attractive,  analysts  said.  Companies  such  as  Quiksilver  would  be  able  to  cut  costs  by  selling  Rossignol  skis  through  their  shops,  they  added.  The  Boix-Vives  family  is  thought  to  have  spent  the  past  couple  of  years  sounding  out  possible  suitors  for  Rossignol,  which  also  makes  golf  equipment,  snowboards  and  sports  clothing."

The  company  also  cited  difficult  trading  conditions  and  a  lack  of  demand  for  goods  such  as  its  Slimfast  range.  Unilever,  which  owns  brands  including  Dove  soap,  said  annual  pre-tax  profit  fell  36%  to  2.9bn  euros  (£1.99bn).  Shares  fell  1%  to  510.75  pence  in  London,  and  dropped  by  1.2%  to  50.50  euros  in  Amsterdam.  |||    Under  the  restructuring  plans,  Patrick  Cescau,  the  UK-based  co-chairman,  will  become  group  chief  executive.

""We  are  leaving  behind  one  of  the  key  features  of  Unilever's  governance  but  this  is  a  natural  development  following  the  changes  introduced  last  year.""  The  company,  which  has  had  dual  headquarters  in  Rotterdam  and  London  since  1930,  will  announce  the  location  of  its  head  office  at  a  later  date.  Unilever  is  not  alone  in  trying  to  simplify  its  business.  Oil  giant  Shell  last  year  dismantled  its  dual-ownership  structure,  after  a  series  of  problems  relating  to  the  size  of  its  oil  reserves  that  hammered  its  share  price  and  led  to  the  resignation  of  key  board  members.  ""The  best  part  of  the  news  this  morning  was  that  the  company  announced  a  structure  simplification,""  said  Arjan  Sweere,  an  analyst  at  Petercam.  |||    The  company  said  the  organizational  changes  would  speed  decision  making,  and  it  also  may  make  further  changes.  |||    The  company  said  its  main  focus  will  be  on  improving  profits,  and  it  is  planning  to  accelerate  and  increase  investment  in  its  400  main  brands.  ""While  it  is  certainly  the  case  that  markets  have  been  tougher  in  the  past  eighteen  months  than  we  had  expected,  we  have  also  lost  some  market  share,""  said  Mr  Cescau.  ""We  let  a  range  of  targets  limit  our  ability  flexibility  and  did  not  adjust  our  plans  quickly  enough  to  a  more  difficult  business  environment.""  ""Our  objective  is  to  reverse  the  share  loss  that  we  experienced  in  some  markets  in  2004  and  return  to  growth.""  |||    Unilever  said  European  sales  fell  2.8%  last  year,  dragged  down  by  below  part  sales  at  its  beverage  division,  where  revenues  dipped  by  almost  4%.  |||    Sales  of  ice  cream  and  frozen  food  dipped  by  3.4%  In  the  US  last  year,  revenue  grew  by  1.5%  ""despite  disappointing  sales  in  Slimfast"",  the  company  said.  In  Asia,  leading  products  came  under  ""attack""  from  rivals  such  as  Procter  &  Gamble.  Unilever  took  a  1.5bn  euro  one-time  charge  in  the  fourth  quarter,  including  a  650m  euro  write-down  on  Slimfast  diet  foods.  Sales  of  Slimfast  products  have  been  hit  in  recent  years  by  the  popularity  of  the  Atkins  diet.  But  looking  ahead,  Unilever  said  it  was  optimistic  about  prospects  for  its  slimming  products  saying  that  demand  is  on  the  wane  for  rival  low-carbohydrate  diets.  The  company  also  said  it  planned  to  spend  500m  euros  this  year  buying  back  shares."

Parmalat  was  placed  into  bankruptcy  protection  in  2003  after  a  14bn  euro  black  hole  was  found  in  its  accounts.  More  than  130,000  people  lost  money  following  the  firm's  collapse.  Mr  Tanzi,  66,  issued  a  statement  through  his  lawyer  after  five  hours  of  questioning  by  prosecutors  in  Parma  on  15  January.  |||    Prosecutors  are  seeking  indictments  against  Mr  Tanzi  and  28  others  -  including  several  members  of  his  family  and  former  Parmalat  chief  financial  officer  Fausto  Tonna  -  for  alleged  manipulation  of  stock  market  prices  and  making  misleading  statements  to  accountants  and  Italy's  financial  watchdog.  Two  former  Parmalat  auditors  will  stand  trial  later  this  month  for  their  role  in  the  firm's  collapse.  |||    ""I  apologise  to  all  who  have  suffered  so  much  damage  as  a  result  of  my  schemes  to  make  my  dream  of  an  industrial  project  come  true,""  Mr  Tanzi's  statement  said.  ""It  is  my  duty  to  collaborate  fully  with  prosecutors  to  reconstruct  the  causes  of  Parmalat's  sudden  default  and  who  is  responsible.""  Mr  Tanzi  spent  several  months  in  jail  in  the  wake  of  Parmalat's  collapse  and  was  kept  under  house  arrest  until  last  September.  Parmalat  is  now  being  run  by  a  state  appointed  administrator,  Enrico  Bondi,  who  has  launched  lawsuits  against  80  banks  in  an  effort  to  recover  money  for  the  bankrupt  company  and  its  shareholders.  He  has  alleged  that  these  companies  were  aware  of  the  true  state  of  Parmalat's  finances  but  continued  to  lend  money  to  the  company.  The  companies  insist  they  were  the  victims  of  fraudulent  book-keeping.  Parmalat  was  declared  insolvent  after  it  emerged  that  4  billion  euros  (£2.8bn;  $4.8bn)  it  supposedly  held  in  an  offshore  account  did  not  in  fact  exist.  The  firm's  demise  sent  shock  waves  through  Italy,  where  its  portfolio  of  top-selling  food  brands  and  its  position  as  the  owner  of  leading  football  club  Parma  had  turned  it  into  a  household  name." 

1	"Sir  Paul  rocks  Super  Bowl  crowds  |||    Sir  Paul  McCartney  wowed  fans  with  a  live  mini-concert  at  American  football's  Super  Bowl  -  and  avoided  any  Janet  Jackson-style  controversies.  |||    The  62-year-old  sang  Hey  Jude  and  other  Beatles  songs  in  a  12-minute  set  at  half-time  during  the  game  in  Florida.  Last  year,  Jackson  exposed  a  breast  during  a  dance  routine,  causing  outrage  among  millions  of  TV  viewers  and  landing  the  CBS  TV  network  a  fine.  Sir  Paul,  however,  did  nothing  more  racy  than  remove  his  jacket  as  he  sang.  Organisers  were  widely  considered  to  be  playing  it  safe  this  year  by  booking  62-year-old  Sir  Paul  for  his  second  Super  Bowl  show.  |||    Three  years  ago,  he  was  invited  to  perform  at  the  first  Super  Bowl  after  the  September  11  attacks  and  performed  his  specially-written  song  Freedom.  This  time,  he  started  off  the  show,  at  the  Alltel  Stadium  in  Jacksonville,  Florida,  with  the  Beatles  numbers  Drive  My  Car  and  Get  Back.  He  then  performed  a  mellow  version  of  Live  And  Let  Die,  the  James  Bond  theme  he  recorded  with  the  band  Wings.  Finally,  he  closed  the  show  with  a  rousing  version  of  Hey  Jude.  The  former  Beatle  resisted  any  temptation  to  refer  to  Janet  Jackson's  headline-grabbing  performance  last  year,  instead  keeping  banter  between  songs  to  a  minimum  in  order  to  squeeze  as  much  music  as  he  could  into  his  slot.  The  singer  removed  his  black  jacket  halfway  through  the  show  -  but  any  fans  hoping  for  a  second  ""Nipple-gate""  were  to  be  disappointed  as  he  kept  his  red  sweatshirt  on  underneath.  |||    Earlier,  the  Black  Eyed  Peas  and  Alicia  Keys  had  provided  the  night's  other  high-profile  entertainment  by  performing  in  a  pre-game  show.  Black  Eyed  Peas  singer  Fergie  was  dressed  in  a  tight  orange  top  and  purple  hotpants,  but  nothing  in  her  performance  was  likely  to  upset  TV  watchdogs.  After  the  controversy  last  year  -  which  saw  CBS  fined  a  record  $550,000  (£292,000)  by  federal  regulators  -  Super  Bowl  organisers  had  turned  to  producer  Don  Mischer  to  oversee  this  year's  half-time  show.  His  previous  production  credits  included  Olympic  opening  and  closing  ceremonies.  The  Super  Bowl  is  watched  by  an  audience  of  144.4  million  in  the  US,  with  many  of  the  people  watching  are  said  to  tune  in  specifically  to  see  the  entertainment  put  on  around  the  event.  Michael  Jackson,  Aerosmith,  Diana  Ross,  Gloria  Estefan  and  Phil  Collins  are  among  the  stars  who  have  previously  graced  the  Super  Bowl  stage." 

0	"Ukraine  trims  privatisation  check  |||    Ukraine  is  to  review  ""dozens""  of  state  asset  sales  as  the  country's  new  administration  tackles  corruption.  |||    The  figure  announced  by  President  Viktor  Yushchenko  is  less  than  the  3,000  cases  mentioned  last  week,  but  will  cover  many  of  the  biggest  deals.  Ukraine  recently  ousted  long-serving  leader  Leonid  Kuchma  and  has  said  it  wants  closer  European  Union  links.  In  a  separate  statement,  the  EU  said  that  the  US  should  back  Ukraine's  entry  into  the  World  Trade  Organisation.  The  comments  came  as  Viktor  Yushchenko  prepared  to  head  to  Brussels  to  meet  with  US  President  George  W  Bush  and  other  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organisation  (Nato)  leaders.  He  is  the  only  non-Nato  member  leader  invited  to  attend  the  summit.  |||    Mr  Yushchenko  recently  defeated  Moscow-backed  presidential  candidate  and  Prime  Minister  Viktor  Yanukovych  at  the  polls,  and  has  made  no  secret  of  his  wish  to  fight  corruption  and  make  Ukraine  more  transparent.  |||    Earlier  this  month,  new  Prime  Minister  Yulia  Tymoshenko  said  as  many  as  3,000  firms  may  have  their  privatisations  put  under  the  spotlight.  Her  comments  raised  concerns  among  a  number  of  investors  and  Mr  Yushchenko  was  seen  on  Monday  as  trying  to  soothe  their  frayed  nerves.  ""We  acknowledge  that  business  in  Ukraine  is  now  shaped  and  98%  of  privatisations  were  carried  out  according  to  the  law,""  Mr  Yushchenko  said  on  Monday.  ""We  have  trust  in  this  business  and  want  to  defend  it  by  law,""  he  continued,  adding  that  any  review  would  focus  on  ""dozens  of  companies,  not  hundreds  or  thousands"".  He  cited  last  year's  sale  of  Ukrainian  steel  producer  Krivorizhstal  as  one  that  had  raised  concerns.  It  was  sold  in  June  2004  to  a  consortium  that  included  Viktor  Pinchuk,  son-in-law  of  former-President  Kuchma,  and  Rinat  Akhmetov,  the  country's  richest  man,  for  $800m  (£424m)  -  despite  other  higher  offers.  |||    Vice-Prime  Minister  Oleg  Rybachuk  called  on  the  EU  to  recognise  the  steps  that  Ukraine  was  taking,  fearing  that  should  the  country  not  be  rewarded  for  its  efforts  there  may  be  a  backlash  against  closer  relations  with  Brussels.  He  said  that  while  he  understood  that  Ukraine  was  not  ready  for  EU  membership,  the  country  needed  to  see  progress  on  topics  such  as  trade  and  visa  requirements.  ""We  deserve  an  honest  response,""  Mr  Rybachuk  told  the  Associated  Press  in  an  interview.  ""We  understand  the  difficulties.  We  refuse  to  understand  double  standards.""  Ukraine  may  find  it  has  a  sympathetic  ear  in  Brussels  ""The  EU  has  reiterated  that  we  support  (Ukraine's)  fast  accession  to  the  WTO  and  if  possible  we  would  like  that  to  happen  some  time  during  the  year,""  said  Claude  Veron-Reville,  a  spokesman  for  EU  trade  commissioner  Peter  Mandelson.  ""We  have  said  as  much  to  the  Americans.  We  feel  that  it  is  important  for  us  all  to  pull  together  for  Ukraine  to  be  allowed  into  the  WTO.  Mr  Yushchenko  was  careful  not  to  turn  his  back  on  Russia,  which  borders  the  country  to  the  east,  saying  it  was  important  to  maintain  'pragmatic'  ties  with  Moscow.  ""Russia  is  Ukraine's  eternal  strategic  partner,""  Mr  Yushchenko  said." 

3	"Moya  clinches  Cup  for  Spain  |||    Spain  won  the  Davis  Cup  for  the  second  time  in  their  history  when  Carlos  Moya  beat  the  USA's  Andy  Roddick  in  the  fourth  rubber  in  Seville.  |||    Moya  won  6-2  7-6  (7-1)  7-6  (7-5)  to  give  the  hosts  an  unassailable  3-1  lead  with  only  one  singles  rubber  remaining.  Roddick  battled  hard  and  had  chances  in  the  second  set,  but  Moya's  clay-court  expertise  proved  the  difference.  Mardy  Fish  beat  Tommy  Robredo  7-6  (8-6)  6-2  in  the  final  dead  rubber  to  cut  Spain's  winning  margin  to  3-2.  Spain's  only  other  Davis  Cup  title  came  in  2000,  when  they  beat  Australia  in  Barcelona.  This  time  they  chose  to  play  the  final  in  Seville  and  the  city's  Olympic  Stadium  was  revamped  to  allow  for  a  record  crowd  for  a  competitve  tennis  event  of  27,000  spectators.  And  the  home  fans  gave  vociferous  support  to  their  players,  with  18-year-old  Nadal  and  Moya  winning  both  Friday's  singles  rubbers.  American  twins  Mike  and  Bob  Bryan  gave  the  visitors  hope  with  victory  over  Juan  Carlos  Ferrero  and  Tommy  Robredo  in  Saturday's  doubles.  But  it  remained  an  uphill  task  for  a  US  team  far  happier  on  hard  courts  than  clay,  and  1998  French  Open  champion  Moya  had  too  much  for  world  number  two  Roddick.  ""This  has  been  incredible  -  the  moment  I've  been  waiting  for  for  years,""  said  Moya,  who  missed  out  in  2000  through  injury.  ""I've  prepared  myself  for  this  day.  I  knew  that  playing  on  clay  I  would  have  my  chances  to  win.  |||    ""The  Davis  Cup  is  my  dream.  I  can't  ask  for  more.  There  is  nothing  bigger  than  what  I've  lived  today.""  Moya  stormed  into  a  4-0  lead  on  his  way  to  taking  the  first  set  against  Roddick  and  recovered  immediately  from  dropping  serve  in  the  second.  The  match  came  down  to  two  tie-breaks  and  Moya  dominated  both,  clinching  victory  on  his  third  match  point.  Wild  celebrations  followed,  with  an  emotional  Moya  congratulated  by  his  team-mates,  including  Nadal,  who  at  18  years  and  187  days  becomes  the  youngest  ever  victor  in  Davis  Cup  history.  ""I  think  we  put  up  a  better  fight  here  than  in  Paris  two  years  ago,""  said  Roddick,  who  was  on  the  US  team  which  lost  to  France  in  the  2002  semi-finals  at  Roland  Garros.  ""They  were  just  better  than  us  this  weekend.  I  have  nothing  to  be  ashamed  of,  I  gave  it  my  all.  ""I  am  not  going  to  walk  out  of  here  with  my  head  down,  that's  for  sure.  ""There's  no  miracle  answer.  We  have  to  improve.""" 

2	"Taxes  must  be  trusted  -  Kennedy  |||    Public  trust  in  taxes  is  breaking  down  because  Labour  and  Tories  are  not  being  straight  with  people  on  the  issue,  Lib  Dem  leader  Charles  Kennedy  has  said.  |||    A  day  ahead  of  the  government's  pre-Budget  report,  Mr  Kennedy  used  a  speech  to  say  his  party  was  facing  up  to  ""painful  economic  realities"".  He  said  the  current  level  of  taxation  was  about  right,  although  he  would  put  a  new  50%  tax  on  top  earners.  Other  parties  have  accused  the  Lib  Dems  of  making  uncosted  promises.  Mr  Kennedy  made  it  clear  he  was  determined  to  counter  that  accusation.  The  Lib  Dems  have  already  published  what  they  say  are  the  full  costings  for  all  their  plans  and  Wednesday's  speech  did  not  announce  new  policies.  |||    Speaking  at  the  Commonwealth  Club,  Mr  Kennedy  said  it  was  critical  for  a  political  party  to  have  economic  credibility,  both  on  what  it  promised  and  what  it  was  expected  to  deliver.  He  said.  ""Budgets  have  to  add  up.  Tough  choices  are  needed  in  public  spending.""  The  Lib  Dems  would  cut  ""low  priority""  spending,  including  the  government's  ID  cards  scheme  and  the  Child  Trust  Fund.  |||    Those  cutbacks  would  free  up  funds  for  increasing  basic  state  pensions  for  over-75s,  putting  more  police  on  the  streets  and  reintroducing  fee  eye  and  dental  checks,  he  said.  The  Lib  Dems  argue  they  were  honest  about  taxes  in  the  past  by  calling  for  a  1p  rise  on  income  tax.  Now  they  say  the  only  simple  tax  rise  they  want  is  a  new  50%  tax  band  for  top  earners  to  pay  for  scrapping  university  tuition  fees,  providing  free  personal  care  for  elderly  and  disabled  people  and  keeping  local  taxes  down.  There  would  also  be  a  local  income  tax  to  replace  council  tax  and  a  number  of  changes  to  environmental  taxes  to  ensure  it  is  the  ""polluter  who  pays"".  |||    The  Lib  Dems  say  the  Tories  have  only  laid  out  possible  options  for  cutting  taxes  to  grab  headlines  while  Labour  has  hidden  most  of  its  tax  rises.  Mr  Kennedy  said:  ""That  contract  with  the  people  -  that  the  government  will  only  tax  fairly  and  will  spend  their  money  wisely  -  can  only  be  sustained  if  the  political  parties  are  straightforward  about  their  plans.  ""With  the  stealth  tax  strategy  of  Gordon  Brown,  the  obvious  unfairness  of  our  current  tax  system  -  especially  the  council  tax,  and  the  empty  promises  of  the  Conservative  party  on  this  issue  -  it  is  no  wonder  that  trust  in  taxation  is  breaking  down.""  He  challenged  the  Treasury  to  open  up  its  books  so  the  National  Audit  Office  can  report  on  the  government's  performance.  |||    Conservative  co-chairman  Liam  Fox  said:  Liam  Fox  said  ""If  Charles  Kennedy  is  serious  about  making  his  budgets  add  up  he  should  start  by  explaining  how  they  would  fund  their  100  spending  commitments.  ""The  reality  is,  the  Lib  Dems  lack  the  courage  to  tackle  waste  and  bureaucracy,  and  the  only  people  who  would  face  'tough  choices'  would  be  the  families  who  would  be  £630  worse  off  a  year.  ""  And  Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  said  the  Lib  Dem  figures  did  not  add  up.  He  accused  the  party  of  claiming  it  would  spend  less  while  across  the  country  committing  itself  to  spend  more." 

0	"LSE  'sets  date  for  takeover  deal'  |||    The  London  Stock  Exchange  (LSE)  is  planning  to  announce  a  preferred  takeover  by  the  end  of  the  month,  newspaper  reports  claim.  |||    The  Sunday  Telegraph  said  the  LSE's  plan  was  further  evidence  it  wants  to  retain  tight  control  over  its  destiny.  Both  Deutsche  Boerse  and  rival  Euronext  held  talks  with  the  London  market  last  week  over  a  possible  offer.  A  £1.3bn  offer  from  Deutsche  Boerse  has  already  been  rejected,  while  Euronext  has  said  it  will  make  an  all  cash  bid.  Speculation  suggests  that  Paris-based  Euronext  has  the  facilities  in  place  to  make  a  bid  of  £1.4bn,  while  its  German  rival  may  up  its  bid  to  the  £1.5bn  mark.  Neither  has  yet  tabled  a  formal  bid,  but  the  LSE  is  expected  to  hold  further  talks  with  the  two  parties  later  this  week.  However,  the  Sunday  Telegraph  report  added  that  there  are  signs  that  Deutsche  Boerse  chief  executive  Werner  Seifert  is  becoming  increasingly  impatient  with  the  LSE's  managed  bid  process.  |||    Despite  insisting  he  wants  to  agree  a  recommended  deal  with  the  LSE's  board,  the  newspaper  suggested  he  may  pull  out  of  the  process  and  put  an  offer  directly  to  shareholders  instead.  The  newspaper  also  claimed  Mr  Seifert  was  becoming  ""increasingly  frustrated""  with  the  pace  of  negotiations  since  Deutsche  Boerse's  £1.3bn  offer  was  rejected  in  mid-December,  in  particular  the  LSE's  decision  to  suspend  talks  over  the  Christmas  period.  Meanwhile,  the  German  exchange's  offer  has  come  under  fire  recently.  Unions  for  Deutsche  Boerse  staff  in  Frankfurt  have  reportedly  expressed  fears  that  up  to  300  jobs  would  be  moved  to  London  if  the  takeover  is  successful.  Others  claim  it  will  weaken  the  city's  status  as  Europe's  financial  centre,  while  German  politicians  are  also  said  to  be  angry  over  the  market  operator's  promise  to  move  its  headquarters  to  London  if  a  bid  is  successful.  A  further  stumbling  block  is  Deutsche  Boerse's  control  over  its  Clearstream  unit,  the  clearing  house  that  processes  securities  transactions.  LSE  shareholders  fear  it  would  create  a  monopoly  situation,  weakening  the  position  of  shareholders  when  negotiating  lower  transaction  fees  for  share  dealings.  LSE  and  Euronext  do  not  have  control  over  their  clearing  and  settlement  operations,  a  situation  which  critics  say  is  more  transparent  and  competitive."

""You  have  explored  the  possibilities  of  film  with  an  immense  talent,""  Mr  de  Vabres  said  as  he  presented  the  award.  Parker  praised  French  films,  saying:  ""Hollywood,  which  created  modern  cinema,  uses  it  only  as  a  commodity.""  He  told  the  minister:  ""I  am  honoured  to  be  thus  distinguished  by  France,  the  flag  carrier  of  cinema  throughout  the  world.""  Sir  Alan's  films  include  Oscar-winning  Fame  plus  Midnight  Express  and  The  Commitments.  |||    A  founding  member  of  the  Director's  Guild  of  Great  Britain,  he  is  a  former  chairman  of  the  UK  Film  Council  and  on  the  board  of  the  British  Film  Institute.  ""Through  your  work  and  your  campaigns,  you  have  shown  us  how  the  artist  occupies  an  essential  place  in  our  contemporary  society,""  Mr  de  Vabres  said.  ""Through  your  dreams  which  you  show  us,  through  the  links  that  you  weave,  you  question  the  world  through  the  mirror  of  your  work.""  He  also  cited  the  director's  2003  film  The  Life  of  David  Gale,  in  which  Kevin  Spacey  played  a  man  on  Death  Row,  as  proof  of  his  ""veritable  artistic  commitment  against  the  death  sentence""."

But  the  date  has  been  put  back  to  17  April  to  create  a  ""level  playing  field""  for  independent  labels.

2	"Conservative  MP  defects  to  Labour  |||    A  Conservative  MP  and  former  minister  has  defected  to  Labour.  |||    Robert  Jackson,  58,  MP  for  Wantage  in  Oxfordshire,  said  he  was  disillusioned  with  the  party's  leadership  and  its  ""dangerous""  views  on  Europe.  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  declared  himself  ""delighted"",  saying  Mr  Jackson  would  be  warmly  welcomed  by  Labour  MPs.  Mr  Jackson,  who  has  clashed  with  his  leaders  over  tuition  fees  and  Europe  in  the  past,  served  as  higher  education  minister  between  1987  and  1990.  In  a  letter  to  his  constituency  chairman  he  wrote:  ""It  is  in  the  country's  best  interest  that  Tony  Blair  rather  than  Michael  Howard  should  form  the  next  government.""  While  saying  he  admired  Mr  Blair's  ""courageous""  leadership  of  the  country,  he  bitterly  criticised  the  Conservatives  stance  on  Europe.  ""The  Conservative  Party's  hostility  to  Europe  has  now  hardened  to  the  point  at  which  it  advocates  the  unilateral  denunciation  of  Britain's  treaty  obligations,""  he  wrote.  |||    Mr  Blair  said  Mr  Jackson  was  a  ""decent,  fair-minded  and  dedicated  public  servant...  who  will  be  warmly  welcome  by  Labour  MPs  and  members"".  ""As  he  rightly  says,  [the  Conservatives]  have  learned  nothing  from  their  two  election  defeats  and  are,  if  anything,  drifting  further  rightwards,""  he  added.  A  spokesman  for  Michael  Howard  said  Mr  Jackson's  views  on  policy  issues  were  ""very  different""  from  those  of  the  party  leadership.  ""He  believes  students  should  pay  tuition  fees,  that  Tony  Blair  should  not  be  criticised  over  his  handling  of  the  Iraq  war  and  that  more  powers  should  be  given  to  Europe,""  the  spokesman  said.  He  added  that  it  was  not  surprising  Mr  Jackson  had  chosen  to  leave  the  Conservatives.  Mr  Jackson  is  due  to  stand  down  at  the  next  election.  He  is  the  third  Conservative  MP  to  defect  to  Labour  since  1997." 

1	"Three  DJs  replace  Peel  radio  show  |||    The  late  John  Peel's  BBC  Radio  1  show  is  to  be  succeeded  in  February  by  three  shows  hosted  by  three  DJs  focusing  on  diverse,  non-commercial  music.  |||    Huw  Stephens,  Ras  Kwame  and  Rob  Da  Bank  will  each  host  the  mid-week,  late-night  timeslot,  showcasing  UK  talent.  Radio  1  said  the  show  would  not  try  to  replace  Peel,  but  would  rise  to  the  ""challenge""  of  ""keeping  his  legacy  alive""  with  unpredictable  music.  Peel  died  after  suffering  a  heart  attack  in  Peru  in  October.  Radio  1  said  the  three  DJs  had  been  chosen  for  their  ""in-depth  musical  knowledge  across  a  variety  of  musical  genres"".  Rob  Da  Bank  has  been  hosting  The  John  Peel  Show  since  the  DJ's  death.  He  is  also  one  of  the  hosts  of  The  Blue  Room,  an  early  morning  weekend  show  that  plays  a  mix  of  old  and  new  electronic  and  dance  music.  Huw  Stephens  is  currently  one  half  of  the  Radio  1  Thursday  night  show  Bethan  and  Huw  in  Wales,  which  explores  new  music,  especially  up  and  coming  acts  breaking  through  in  Wales.  And  Ras  Kwame  is  the  host  of  100%  Homegrown  on  Radio  1's  digital  station  1Xtra.  His  show  is  dedicated  to  showcasing  the  best  of  UK  black  music  and  broadcasts  live  sessions,  often  giving  new  artists  their  first  chance  to  perform  on  live  national  radio.  |||    All  of  the  three  DJs  will  continue  to  host  their  current  shows  on  Radio  1.  ""It  is  widely  accepted  that  John  Peel  can  never  be  replaced,""  said  the  radio  station.  It  added  that  One  Music  would  support  both  signed  and  unsigned  talent,  and  said:  ""It  will  seek  out  those  making  music  for  music's  sake  rather  than  for  commercial  success.  ""Above  all  it  will  provide  support  to  emerging  genres  of  music  and  styles  that  have  not  yet  and  may  never  reach  the  mainstream.""  |||    One  Music  is  not  new  to  Radio  1  as  it  already  exists  as  a  website,  offering  advice  on  aspects  of  the  music  industry,  such  as  recording  a  demo  and  signing  a  record  contract.  Radio  1's  controller,  Andy  Parfitt,  said:  ""We  believe  that  by  having  a  series  of  DJs  hosting  a  selection  of  shows  under  the  One  Music  title,  we  will  ensure  that  his  legacy  lives  on.""  Stephens  said  he  grew  up  ""listening  to  John""  and  that  it  was  a  ""massive  honour""  to  continue  Peel's  work  championing  new  music.  The  show  will  be  broadcast  from  1  February  on  Tuesdays,  Wednesdays  and  Thursdays  from  2300  GMT  -  0100  GMT."

He  added  that  the  boom  has  allowed  the  government  to  collect  $950m  in  taxes.  Mr  Cartagena  said  the  industry  expects  to  see  investment  worth  $10bn  over  the  next  three  years.  |||    ""With  these  investments,  clearly  we  are  going  to  continue  being  the  principle  actor  in  the  mining  of  copper.  It's  a  consolidation  of  the  industry  with  new  projects  and  expansions  that  will  support  greater  production.""  Australia's  BHP  Billiton  -  which  operates  La  Escondida,  the  world's  largest  open  pit  copper  mine  -  is  planning  to  invest  $1.9bn  between  now  and  2007,  while  state-owned  Codelco  will  spend  about  $1bn  on  various  projects.  Chile,  the  biggest  copper  producer  in  the  world,  is  now  analyzing  ways  of  to  keep  prices  stable  at  their  current  high  levels,  without  killing  off  demand  or  leading  customers  to  look  for  substitutes  for  copper.  The  copper  price  reached  a  16-year  high  in  October  2004.  Production  in  Chile  is  expected  rise  3.5%  in  2005  to  5.5  million  tonnes,  said  Mr  Cartagena.  Cochilco  expects  for  2005  a  slight  reduction  on  copper  prices  and  forecasts  export  earnings  will  fall  10.7%."

In  The  Chorus  (Les  Choristes),  Jugnot  plays  an  inspiring  music  teacher  at  a  school  for  troubled  boys  in  1949.  Despite  starring  in  five  films  in  2004,  Depardieu  made  3.35m  Euros  (£2.31m)  putting  him  third  place  in  the  chart.  ""His  name  [Depardieu]  is  no  longer  sufficient  to  guarantee  the  success  of  a  film,""  said  Le  Figaro  newspaper.  The  Chorus,  which  Jugnot  also  co-produced,  has  drawn  an  audience  of  nearly  nine  million  people  since  its  release  last  year.  |||    Godzilla  star  Jean  Reno  was  France's  second  best-paid  actor  in  2004,  earning  3.55m  Euros  (£2.45m)  .  His  roles  include  a  recent  uncredited  cameo  in  the  Oscar-nominated  Hotel  Rwanda.  The  highest-ranking  woman  on  Le  Figaro's  list  was  Audrey  Tautou  in  10th  place,  earning  885,000  Euros  (£611,000).

""2004  reinforces  the  trend  towards  higher  losses,""  said  Swiss  Re.  Tightly  packed  populations  in  the  areas  involved  in  natural  and  man-made  disasters  were  to  partly  to  blame  for  the  rise  in  claims,  it  said.  Some  95%  of  insurance  claims  were  for  natural  catastrophes,  with  the  rest  attributed  to  made-made  events.  |||    The  largest  claims  came  from  the  US,  which  was  struck  by  four  hurricanes,  and  Japan,  which  suffered  the  highest  concentration  of  typhoons  for  decades  plus  a  major  earthquake.  |||    Europe  suffered  fewer  natural  disasters,  but  191  people  were  killed  and  more  than  2,000  injured  in  March  after  the  terrorist  attack  on  train  stations  in  Madrid.  The  damages  claimed  in  2004  eclipsed  previous  years,  including  2001  when  the  11  September  attacks  pushed  claims  up  to  $37bn.  Swiss  Re  said  it  had  registered  about  300  natural  and  man-made  disasters  around  the  world  in  2004.  Twenty-one  thousand  people  lost  their  lives  in  the  catastrophes  with  a  cost  to  the  global  economy  of  around  $105bn  (£54bn)."

They  then  took  charge  with  scores  from  Pat  Sanderson,  Kai  Horstman,  Mathew  Tait  and  Rob  Thirlby,  but  Fiji  rallied  to  force  a  tense  finale.  Scotland  were  beaten  33-15  by  Samoa  in  the  plate  semi-final  and  Ireland  lost  17-5  to  Tunisia  in  the  shield  final.  Mike  Friday's  England  side  matched  their  opponents  for  pace,  power  and  skill  in  the  final  and  led  19-7  at  half-time.  But  Neumi  Nanuku  and  Marika  Vakacegu  touched  down  for  Fiji,  only  for  a  needless  trip  by  Tuidriva  Bainivalu  on  Geoff  Appleford  to  allow  England  to  run  down  the  clock.

""This  was  a  band  that  wanted  to  lay  claim  to  this  world  and  the  next  one,  too,""  said  Springsteen.  Bono,  The  Edge,  Adam  Clayton  and  Larry  Mullen  Jr,  who  formed  U2  at  school  in  1977,  begin  a  world  tour  on  28  March.  Introducing  the  band,  Springsteen  mocked  Bono  as  the  man  who  ""single-handedly  pioneered  the  Irish  mullet"",  poking  fun  at  ""one  of  the  best  and  most  endearingly  messianic  complexes  in  rock  'n'  roll"".  But  he  also  spoke  of  the  group's  enduring  stature,  adding  that  it  was  the  only  band  of  the  last  20  years  where  he  knew  all  four  members'  names.  |||    U2's  contemporaries,  the  Pretenders,  led  by  Chrissie  Hynde  -  took  to  the  stage  to  perform  My  City  Was  Gone  with  inductee  Neil  Young.  ""We  are  a  tribute  band,""  said  Hynde,  53.  ""We're  paying  tribute  to  James  Honeyman-Scott  and  Pete  Farndon,  without  whom  we  would  not  have  been  here,""  she  said,  referring  to  the  premature  deaths  of  two  of  the  band's  guitarists  from  drug  overdoses.  |||    Britain's  Rod  Stewart  introduced  Percy  Sledge,  citing  his  best-known  hit  When  a  Man  loves  a  Woman  as  ""one  of  the  best  performances  I've  ever  heard"".  Justin  Timberlake  introduced  soul  group  the  O'Jays,  a  gospel-style  quartet  from  Ohio,  who  performed  a  medley  of  their  best-known  songs  including  Back  Stabbers,  Love  Train  and  For  the  Love  of  Money.  ""Anyone  who's  ever  written,  produced  or  performed  something  soulful  stands  in  the  shadows  of  these  giants,""  said  Timberlake.  |||    Joining  the  ceremony  at  New  York's  Waldorf  Astoria  were  legendary  R&B  star  Bo  Diddley,  who  performed  with  Eric  Clapton  and  Robbie  Robertson.  |||    Clapton,  alongside  BB  King,  also  introduced  fellow  guitarist  Buddy  Guy  and  recalled  seeing  him  play  as  a  teenager  in  England.

Also  performing  at  the  ceremony  was  veteran  musician  Jerry  Lee  Lewis  who  continued  his  reputation  as  a  rowdy  piano-pounder  despite  his  69  years,  kicking  over  his  stool  and  sitting  on  the  piano  during  a  rendition  of  Whole  Lotta  Shakin'  Goin'  On." 

2	"Howard  denies  split  over  ID  cards  |||    Michael  Howard  has  denied  his  shadow  cabinet  was  split  over  its  decision  to  back  controversial  Labour  plans  to  introduce  ID  cards.  |||    The  Tory  leader  said  his  front  bench  team  had  reached  a  ""collective  view""  after  holding  a  ""good  discussion"",  but  admitted  it  was  ""not  an  easy  issue"".  He  had  decided  to  support  the  plans  as  the  police  said  they  would  help  fight  terror,  crime  and  illegal  immigration.  The  Lib  Dems  have  pledged  to  oppose  the  bill  when  it  is  debated  next  Monday.  |||    Tory  sources  say  senior  party  figures  had  argued  vociferously  against  the  ID  card  scheme.  Among  those  reported  to  have  serious  reservations  over  the  strategy  were  senior  shadow  cabinet  members  David  Davis,  Oliver  Letwin  and  Tim  Yeo.  But  Mr  Howard  denied  Mr  Yeo,  his  transport  and  environment  spokesman,  said  the  plans  ""stink"".  He  also  said  he  was  confident  shadow  home  secretary  Mr  Davis  would  ""set  out  the  position  very  clearly""  when  he  stands  up  to  debate  the  matter  next  week.  Mr  Howard  said  the  police  had  said  ID  cards  could  ""help  them  foil  a  terror  bomb  plot  in  which  people  could  lose  their  lives"".  He  added:  ""When  the  police  say  that  you  have  to  take  them  seriously"".  |||    He  acknowledged  there  were  ""good  libertarian  arguments""  against  the  cards,  but  said  the  shadow  Cabinet  had  weighed  up  all  the  ""conflicting  interests""  before  reaching  its  decision.  ""I  don't  pretend  that  it  is  an  easy  decision  but  at  the  end  of  the  day  a  decision  has  to  be  taken.""  He  also  denied  he  was  afraid  of  looking  ""soft""  on  the  issue,  compared  to  Labour.  The  Conservatives  announced  their  support  for  the  government  plans  on  Monday  evening.  |||    Sources  within  the  party  told  the  BBC  Mr  Howard  had  always  been  in  favour  of  ID  cards,  and  tried  to  introduce  them  when  he  was  Home  Secretary.  But  the  Tories  insisted  they  would  hold  ministers  to  account  over  the  precise  purpose  of  the  scheme.  |||    They  said  they  would  also  press  Labour  over  whether  objectives  could  be  met  and  whether  the  Home  Office  would  be  able  to  deliver  them.  And  they  pledged  to  assess  the  cost  effectiveness  of  ID  cards  and  whether  people's  privacy  would  be  properly  protected.  ""It  is  important  to  remember  that  this  bill  will  take  a  decade  to  come  into  full  effect,""  a  spokesman  said.  Lib  Dem  home  affairs  spokesman  Mark  Oaten  has  branded  the  ID  scheme  a  waste  of  money  and  ""deeply  flawed"".  He  said:  ""This  has  all  the  signs  of  Michael  Howard  overruling  colleagues'  concerns  over  ID  cards.""  |||    The  chairman  of  the  Bar  Council,  Guy  Mansfield  QC  warned  there  was  a  real  risk  that  people  on  the  ""margins  of  society""  would  be  driven  into  the  hands  of  extremists.  ""What  is  going  to  happen  to  young  Asian  men  when  there  has  been  a  bomb  gone  off  somewhere?  They  are  going  to  be  stopped.  If  they  haven't  [ID  cards]  they  are  going  to  be  detained.""  Tory  ex-minister  Douglas  Hogg  said  he  opposed  the  plans  for  ID  cards  branding  them  a  ""regressive""  step  which  would  intrude  into  the  lives  of  ordinary  citizens  without  any  counterbalancing  benefits.  He  predicted  ultimately  carrying  the  cards  would  become  compulsory  and  that  would  lead  to  large  numbers  of  Britain's  ethnic  minorities  being  stopped  by  police." 

2	"How  political  squabbles  snowball  |||    It's  become  commonplace  to  argue  that  Blair  and  Brown  are  like  squabbling  school  kids  and  that  they  (and  their  supporters)  need  to  grow  up  and  stop  bickering.  |||    But  this  analysis  in  fact  gets  it  wrong.  It's  not  just  children  who  fight  -  adults  do  too.  And  there  are  solid  reasons  why  even  a  trivial  argument  between  mature  protagonists  can  be  hard  to  stop  once  its  got  going.  The  key  feature  of  an  endless  feud  is  that  everyone  can  agree  they'd  be  better  off  if  it  ended  -  but  everyone  wants  to  have  the  last  word.  |||    Each  participant  genuinely  wants  the  row  to  stop,  but  thinks  it  worth  prolonging  the  argument  just  a  tiny  bit  to  ensure  their  view  is  heard.  Their  successive  attempts  to  end  the  argument  with  their  last  word  ensure  the  argument  goes  on  and  on  and  on.  (In  the  case  of  Mr  Blair  and  Mr  Brown,  successive  books  are  published,  ensuring  the  issues  never  die.)  Now  this  isn't  because  the  participants  are  stupid  -  it's  actually  each  individual  behaving  entirely  rationally,  given  the  incentives  facing  them.  Indeed,  there's  even  a  piece  of  economic  theory  that  explains  all  this.  Nothing  as  obscure  as  ""post-neo-classical  endogenous  growth  theory""  which  the  chancellor  himself  once  quoted  -  but  a  ubiquitous  piece  of  game  theory  which  all  respectable  policy  wonks  are  familiar  with.  |||    It's  often  referred  to  as  the  ""prisoner's  dilemma"",  based  on  a  parable  much  told  in  economics  degree  courses...  about  a  sheriff  and  two  prisoners.  The  story  goes  that  two  prisoners  are  jointly  charged  with  a  heinous  crime,  and  are  locked  up  in  separate  cells.  But  the  sheriff  desperately  needs  a  confession  from  at  least  one  of  them,  to  provide  enough  evidence  to  convict  them  of  the  crime.  Without  a  confession,  the  prisoners  will  get  a  minimal  sentence  on  some  trumped  up  charge.  |||    Clearly  the  prisoners'  best  strategy  is  to  keep  their  mouths  shut,  and  take  the  short  sentence,  but  the  clever  sheriff  has  an  idea  to  induce  them  to  talk.  He  tells  each  prisoner  separately,  that  if  they  confess  -  and  they  are  the  only  one  to  confess  -  they'll  be  let  off  their  crime.  And  he  tells  them  that  if  they  don't  confess  -  and  they  are  the  only  one  not  to  confess  -  they'll  get  life.  Now,  if  you  are  prisoner  confronted  with  this  choice,  your  best  bet  is  to  confess.  If  your  partner  doesn't  confess,  you'll  get  off  completely.  And  if  your  partner  does  confess,  you'd  better  confess  to  ensure  you  don't  get  life.  The  result  is  of  course,  both  prisoners  confess,  so  the  sheriff  does  not  have  to  let  either  one  off.  Both  prisoners'  individual  logic  was  to  behave  that  way,  even  though  both  would  have  been  better  if  they  had  somehow  agreed  to  shut  up.  Don't  worry  if  you  don't  entirely  follow  it  -  you  can  to  look  it  up  on  Google,  where  there  are  283,000  entries  on  it.  |||    The  prisoners'  dilemma  and  all  its  ramifications  have  truly  captured  economists  in  the  last  couple  of  decades.  It  is  a  parable  used  to  describe  any  situation  where  there  is  an  obvious  sensible  choice  to  be  taken  collectively,  but  where  the  only  rational  choice  individually  is  to  behave  selfishly.  |||    A  cold  war  arms  race  for  example  -  a  classic  case  where  both  Russia  and  America  would  be  better  off  with  just  a  few  arms,  rather  than  a  lot  of  arms.  But  as  long  as  each  wants  just  a  few  more  arms  than  the  other,  an  arms  race  ensues  with  the  results  that  the  individually  logical  decision  to  buy  more  arms,  results  in  arms  levels  that  are  too  high.  What  economics  tells  us  is  that  once  you're  in  a  prisoners'  dilemma  -  unless  you  are  repeating  the  experience  many  times  over  -  it's  hard  to  escape  the  perverse  logic  of  it.  It's  no  good  just  exhorting  people  to  stop  buying  arms,  or  to  stop  arguing  when  all  their  incentives  encourage  them  to  carry  on.  Somehow,  the  incentives  have  to  change.  |||    In  the  case  of  the  Labour  Party,  if  you  believe  the  rift  between  Blair  and  Brown  camps  is  as  bad  as  the  reports  suggest,  Solomon's  wisdom  needs  to  be  deployed  to  solve  the  problem.  Every  parent  knows  there  are  ingenious  solutions  to  arguments,  solutions  which  affect  the  incentives  of  the  participants.  An  example,  is  the  famous  rule  that  ""one  divides,  the  other  chooses""  as  a  way  of  allocating  a  piece  of  cake  to  be  sliced  up  between  greedy  children.  In  the  case  of  an  apparently  endless  argument,  if  you  want  it  to  come  to  an  end,  you  have  to  ensure  the  person  who  has  the  last  word  is  one  who  loses  rather  than  the  one  who  wins  the  row.  The  cost  of  prolonging  the  row  by  even  one  more  briefing,  or  one  more  book  for  that  matter,  has  to  exceed  the  benefit  of  having  the  last  word,  and  getting  your  point  in.  If  the  rest  of  the  party  can  enforce  that,  they'll  have  the  protagonists  retreating  pretty  quickly."

2	"Labour's  election  love-in  |||    Peace  and  love  have  been  in  short  supply  in  the  Labour  party  in  recent  days.  |||    If  press  reports  are  to  be  believed,  Alan  Milburn  and  Gordon  Brown  have  been  at  each  other's  throats  over  the  contents  of  Labour's  next  election  manifesto.  But  the  pair  were  all  smiles  on  Tuesday  morning,  as  they  joined  John  Prescott  to  unveil  Labour's  latest  poster  campaign.  The  event  -  at  Old  Billingsgate  Fish  Market  on  the  banks  of  the  Thames  -  was  a  carefully  choreographed  show  of  unity.  And  the  surest  sign  yet  that  we  are  heading  for  a  general  election  in  the  next  few  months.  It  was  also  one  of  the  most  bizarre  photo  opportunities  of  recent  years.  |||    The  first  inkling  something  slightly  odd  was  afoot  was  when  -  in  place  of  the  soft  rock  music  normally  chosen  for  such  occasions  -  Labour's  speakers  crackled  to  life  with  the  sound  of  Booker  T  and  the  MGs.  Then  a  VW  camper  van  trundled  into  view,  decked  out  in  that  most  mind-bending  of  psychedelic  messages  -  ""lowest  mortgage  rate  for  40  years"".  As  the  side-door  slid  open,  it  looked  for  one  glorious  moment  as  if  the  Cabinet  had  decided  to  bury  their  differences  and  go  on  the  road  together,  Scooby  Doo-style.  But,  sadly,  it  wasn't  the  Cabinet  who  had  raided  the  dressing-up  box  -  just  six  rather  ill-at-ease  looking  Labour  students.  Two  were  dressed  as  Regency  dandies  -  to  unveil  a  poster  trumpeting  ""the  longest  period  of  economic  growth  for  200  years"".  Another  pair  of  students  were  in  a  Beatle  wig  and  Sgt  Pepper  jacket  to  highlight  the  ""lowest  interest  rates  since  the  1960s"".  |||    The  remaining  two  were  dressed  in  a  vague  approximation  of  disco  chic  to  demonstrate  the  ""lowest  unemployment  since  the  seventies"".  |||    The  politicians  -  led  out  by  John  Prescott  -  were  soberly-suited  as  always.  The  event  may  have  been  designed  to  highlight  Labour's  economic  success  under  Mr  Brown,  but  there  was  little  doubt  who  was  in  charge.  The  chancellor  walked  side-by-side  with  Mr  Milburn,  pointedly  exchanging  chit  chat,  as  they  approached  the  microphone.  But  it  was  Mr  Milburn  who  took  centre  stage,  speaking  of  the  ""positive  campaign""  the  party  hoped  to  stage  in  the  ""coming  weeks  and  months"".  |||    The  mobile  poster  vans  would  ""let  people  know  Britain  is  working  again"".  Mr  Brown  repeated  the  familiar  mantras  displayed  on  the  posters  and  spoke  of  Labour's  ""shared  purpose""  and  ""united  dedication"".  It  was  left  to  Mr  Prescott  to  pay  glowing  tribute  to  the  chancellor's  record  and,  in  a  final  flourish,  to  produce  his  famous  pledge  card,  from  1997,  claiming  Labour  has  met  all  of  its  promises.  The  event  was  carefully  stage-managed  to  underline  Cabinet  unity.  And,  more  specifically,  to  demonstrate  the  ""central  role""  Mr  Brown  will  play  in  the  election  campaign,  despite  being  sidelined  as  campaign  chief  in  favour  of  Mr  Milburn.  |||    But  keen  students  of  body  language  will  have  had  a  field  day.  There  was  much  forced  smiling  for  the  cameras,  but  only  Mr  Prescott,  who  revels  in  such  occasions,  seemed  to  be  truly  enjoying  himself.  Mr  Milburn  made  a  point  of  turning  to  face  the  chancellor,  as  he  spoke,  nodding  thoughtfully.  But  it  was  the  former  health  secretary's  final  gesture,  placing  an  arm  on  Mr  Brown's  back  as  they  walked  away  from  the  microphones,  which  was  perhaps  the  most  telling.  Thanks  for  dropping  by  Gordon,  he  might  have  been  saying." 

2	"Brown  calls  for  £5.5bn  Aids  fund  |||    Gordon  Brown  has  called  on  rich  nations  to  fund  a  £5.5bn  ($10bn)  plan  to  fight  the  Aids  epidemic  and  find  a  vaccine.  |||    On  the  fourth  day  of  his  six-day  tour  of  Africa,  the  UK  chancellor  predicted  a  vaccine  could  be  found  by  2012  if  the  world  stepped  up  its  funding  pledges.  Doubling  the  £400m  being  spent  yearly  on  finding  such  a  vaccine  could  advance  it  by  three  years  and  save  six  million  lives,  Mr  Brown  said  on  Thursday.  He  hopes  to  use  the  UK's  G8  presidency  to  push  the  issue  forward.  |||    ""I  believe  that  the  generation  that  provided  the  finance  to  combat,  cure  and  eradicate  the  world's  deadliest  disease  of  today  -  and  today  the  world's  least  curable  disease  -  HIV/Aids  -  will  rightly  earn  the  title  'the  great  generation',""  Mr  Brown  said  in  a  speech  during  his  African  tour.  The  problems  of  HIV/Aids  were  inseparable  from  poverty,  he  added.  ""At  least  $10  billion  per  annum  (£5.5bn)  is  needed  to  address  the  HIV/Aids  crisis  in  low  and  middle  income  countries.  ""Existing  financial  commitments  on  their  own  will  not  stop  the  pandemic.  ""The  UK's  proposal  for  an  International  Finance  Facility  is  so  important  -  increasing  world  aid  flows  by  over  $50  billion  (£27bn).  A  doubling  of  world  aid  to  halve  world  poverty.""  Mr  Brown  also  said  he  had  agreed  with  the  Italian  finance  minister  Domenico  Siniscalco  to  push  forward  with  plans  for  the  world-wide  sharing  and  co-ordination  of  research  into  the  disease.  |||    Currently  the  private  sector  was  only  spending  £60m  a  year  on  seeking  an  inoculation  and  the  market  needed  boosting,  Mr  Brown  said.  He  called  on  industrialised  nations  to  commit  themselves  to  buying  the  first  300m  vaccines  at  a  cost  of  $20  each,  thereby  boosting  the  market  for  inoculations.  This  would  be  a  ""large  enough  inducement  to  create  much  stronger  interest  from  both  large  and  small  pharmaceutical  firms"",  Mr  Brown  added.  |||    More  must  also  be  done  to  finance  the  treatment  and  care  of  those  living  with  HIV/Aids  and  their  families,  he  said.  But  Aid  charity  Actionaid  criticised  Mr  Brown's  preoccupation  with  finding  a  vaccine  and  called  on  G8  nations  to  fund  HIV/Aids  treatments.  The  charity's  head  of  HIV/Aids  in  Britain,  Simon  Wright  said:  ""While  encouraging  the  pharmaceutical  industry  to  discover  an  HIV  vaccine  is  important,  a  failure  to  provide  any  funding  for  HIV  treatments  condemns  a  generation  of  people  to  death.  ""HIV  is  decimating  African  countries,  killing  the  most  productive  adults  who  should  be  working,  caring  for  children  and  building  the  economy.  An  HIV  vaccine  is  probably  at  least  10  years  away.  Treatments  are  needed  now.""  On  Wednesday,  Mr  Brown  visited  slums  in  the  Kenyan  capital  Nairobi  .  He  will  visit  an  HIV/Aids  orphanage  in  Tanzania  and  a  women's  credit  union  in  Mozambique  before  chairing  a  meeting  of  the  Commission  for  Africa  in  Cape  Town.  The  chancellor  has  already  unveiled  proposals  for  a  G8  aid  package  which  he  has  likened  to  the  Marshall  Plan  used  by  the  United  States  to  rebuild  Europe  after  World  War  Two."

Consumer  spending  was  higher  in  December  than  November,  and  festive  sales  were  also  up  on  2003.  The  employment  picture  also  improved,  the  Fed  said.  |||    ""Labour  markets  firmed  in  a  number  of  districts,  but  wage  pressures  generally  remained  modest,""  the  Beige  Book  said.  ""Several  districts  reported  higher  prices  for  building  materials  and  manufacturing  inputs,  but  most  reported  steady  or  only  slightly  higher  overall  price  levels.""  The  report  added  that  residential  real  estate  activity  remained  strong  and  that  commercial  real  estate  activity  strengthened  in  most  districts.  ""Office  leasing  was  especially  brisk  in  Washington  DC,  and  New  York  City,  two  of  the  nation's  strongest  commercial  markets,""  the  Fed  said." 

2	"UK  heading  wrong  way,  says  Howard  |||    Tony  Blair  has  had  the  chance  to  tackle  the  problems  facing  Britain  and  has  failed,  Michael  Howard  has  said.  |||    ""Britain  is  heading  in  the  wrong  direction"",  the  Conservative  leader  said  in  his  New  Year  message.  Mr  Blair's  government  was  a  ""bossy,  interfering  government  that  takes  decisions  that  should  be  made  by  individuals,""  he  added.  But  Labour's  campaign  spokesman  Fraser  Kemp  responded:  ""Britain  is  working,  don't  let  the  Tories  wreck  it  again"".  Mr  Howard  also  paid  tribute  to  the  nation's  character  for  its  generous  response  to  the  Asian  quake  disaster.  The  catastrophe  was  overshadowing  the  hopes  for  the  future  at  this  usually  positive  time  of  the  year,  Mr  Howard  said.  |||    ""We  watched  the  scenes  of  destruction  with  a  sense  of  disbelief.  The  scale,  the  speed,  the  ferocity  of  what  happened  on  Boxing  Day  is  difficult  to  grasp.  ""Yet  Britain's  response  has  shone  a  light  on  our  nation's  character.  The  last  week  has  shown  that  the  warm,  caring  heart  of  Britain  beats  as  strong  as  ever.""  He  went  on  to  reflect  on  the  values  that  ""most  Britons  hold  dear"".  Looking  ahead  to  the  coming  general  election,  he  pledged  to  ""turn  these  beliefs  into  reality""  and  set  out  the  choices  he  says  are  facing  Britain.  ""How  much  tax  do  people  want  to  pay?  Who  will  give  taxpayers  value  for  money,  the  clean  hospitals  and  good,  disciplined  schools  they  want?  ""Who  can  be  trusted  to  get  a  grip  on  the  disorder  on  our  streets  and  the  chaos  in  our  immigration  system?""  |||    Mr  Blair  has  failed  to  tackle  these  problems,  he  claimed,  saying  he  has  the  ""wrong  solution""  to  them.  |||    ""The  result  is  big  government  and  higher  taxes  eroding  incentives,  undermining  enterprise  and  denying  people  choice.  ""Worst  of  all,  it  is  a  government  that  has  wasted  people's  money  and  failed  to  tackle  the  problems  families  face  today.""  The  Tories,  he  said,  can  cut  crime  and  improve  public  services  without  asking  people  to  pay  more  taxes.  ""We  can  have  progress  without  losing  what  makes  Britain  great  -  its  tolerance,  the  respect  for  the  rule  of  law,  the  ability  of  everyone  to  fulfil  their  potential.  ""We  simply  need  to  change  direction.  The  election  will  give  Britain  the  chance  to  change.""  This  is  the  record  Mr  Blair  will  have  to  defend  in  the  coming  months,  he  said,  urging  voters  to  hold  him  to  account.  |||    But  Labour  spokesman  Mr  Kemp  said:  ""It  would  be  more  appropriate  for  this  message  to  come  out  on  1  April,  not  1  January.""  ""Let  us  never  forget  that  when  Michael  Howard  was  in  government  Britain  suffered  mass  unemployment,  15%  interest  rates,  record  home  repossessions,  and  the  introduction  of  the  poll  tax.  ""With  Labour  Britain  is  working.  Rather  than  alluding  to  false  promises  Michael  Howard  should  be  starting  2005  with  an  apology  to  the  British  people  for  the  misery  that  the  government,  of  which  he  was  a  member,  inflicted  upon  the  country."

All  regions  saw  at  least  a  doubling  in  their  assets  during  the  past  decade.  But  Northern  Ireland  led  the  way  with  a  262%  rise,  while  Scotland  saw  the  smallest  increase  of  just  112%.  |||    The  core  retail  price  index  rose  by  just  28%  in  the  same  period,  underlining  how  effective  an  investment  in  housing  has  been  for  most  people  during  the  past  decade.  More  than  a  third  of  the  UK's  private  housing  assets  -  representing  more  than  a  trillion  pounds  in  value  -  are  concentrated  in  London  and  the  South  East,  the  Halifax's  figures  indicate.  Tim  Crawford,  Group  Economist  at  Halifax,  said:  ""The  value  of  the  private  housing  stock  continues  to  grow  and  the  family  home  remains,  by  a  large  margin,  the  most  valuable  asset  of  the  majority  of  households  in  the  UK.""  Halifax's  own  monthly  figures  on  house  sales  -  issued  on  Thursday  -  suggest  the  average  price  of  a  British  property  now  stands  at  £163,748  after  a  0.8%  rise  in  January.  Housing  experts  are  split  on  prospects  for  the  market,  with  some  saying  price  growth  will  slow  but  not  fall,  while  others  predict  a  sharp  drop  in  values." 

0	"Steel  firm  'to  cut'  45,000  jobs  |||    Mittal  Steel,  one  of  the  world's  largest  steel  producers,  could  cut  up  to  45,000  jobs  over  the  next  five  years,  its  chief  executive  has  said.  |||    The  Netherlands-based  company  is  due  to  complete  its  $4.5bn  acquisition  of  US  firm  ISG  next  month,  making  it  one  of  the  largest  global  firms  of  its  kind.  However,  Lakshmi  Mittal  has  told  investors  the  combined  company  will  have  to  shed  thousands  of  jobs.  The  Indian-born  magnate  did  not  say  where  the  job  losses  would  fall.  |||    Mr  Mittal  told  US  investors  that  once  the  acquisition  of  International  Steel  Group  was  completed,  the  company  would  aim  to  reduce  its  workforce  by  between  7,000  and  8,000  annually.  This  could  see  its  workforce  trimmed  from  155,000  to  110,000  staff  by  2010.  ""We  are  investing  in  modernisation  so  employees  will  go  down,""  Mr  Mittal  told  the  conference  in  Chicago.  |||    Mittal  Steel  was  formed  last  year  when  Mr  Mittal's  LNM  Holdings  merged  with  Dutch  firm  Ispat.  A  combination  of  Mittal  Steel  and  ISG  would  have  annual  sales  of  $32bn  (£16.7bn;  24.1bn  euros)  and  a  production  capacity  of  70  million  tonnes.  |||    A  Mittal  Steel  spokeman  said  that  no  decisions  on  job  cuts  have  been  made  yet.  ""We  are  trying  to  create  a  sustainable  steel  industry  and  if  we  want  to  do  that,  we  have  to  invest  in  new  technology,""  a  spokesman  said.  Mittal  Steel  has  operations  in  14  countries.  Many  of  its  businesses  -  particularly  those  in  eastern  Europe  -  were  previously  state  owned  and  have  huge  workforces.

""Obviously  with  a  lot  of  loss  of  life,  a  lot  of  time  is  needed  to  clean  up  the  mess,  bury  the  people  and  find  the  missing,""  said  ABN  Amro's  Eddie  Wong.  ""[But]  it's  not  necessarily  a  really  big  thing  in  the  economic  sense.""  |||    India's  Bombay  Stock  Exchange  inched  slightly  above  its  previous  record  close  on  Wednesday.  Expectations  of  strong  corporate  earnings  in  2005  drove  the  Indonesian  stock  exchange  in  Jakarta  to  a  record  high  on  Wednesday.  In  Hong  Kong,  the  Hang  Seng  index  may  be  benefiting  in  part  from  the  potential  for  its  listed  property  companies  to  gain  from  rebuilding  contracts  in  the  tsunami-affected  regions  of  South  East  Asia.  In  Sri  Lanka,  some  economists  have  said  that  as  much  as  1%  of  annual  growth  may  be  lost.  Sri  Lanka's  stock  market  has  fallen  about  5%  since  the  weekend,  but  it  is  still  40%  higher  than  at  the  start  of  2004.  |||    Thailand  may  lose  30bn  baht  (£398m;  $768m)  in  earnings  from  tourism  over  the  next  three  months,  according  to  tourism  minister  Sontaya  Kunplome.  |||    In  the  affected  provinces,  he  expects  the  loss  of  tourism  revenue  to  be  offset  by  government  reconstruction  spending.  Thailand  intends  to  spend  a  similar  sum  -  around  30bn  baht  -  on  the  rebuilding  work.  ""It  will  take  until  the  fourth  quarter  of  next  year  before  tourist  visitors  in  Phuket  and  five  other  provinces  return  to  their  normal  level,""  said  Naris  Chaiyasoot,  director  general  at  the  ministry's  fiscal  policy  office.  In  the  Maldives  the  cost  of  reconstruction  could  wipe  out  economic  growth,  according  to  a  government  spokesman.  ""Our  nation  is  in  peril  here,""  said  Ahmed  Shaheed,  the  chief  government  spokesman.  He  estimated  the  economic  cost  of  the  disaster  at  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.  The  Maldives  has  gross  domestic  product  of  $660m.  ""It  won't  be  surprising  if  the  cost  exceeds  our  GDP,""  he  said.  ""In  the  last  few  years,  we  made  great  progress  in  our  standard  of  living  -  the  United  Nations  recognised  this.  Now  we  see  this  can  disappear  in  a  few  days,  a  few  minutes.""  Shaheed  noted  that  investment  in  a  single  tourist  resort  -  the  economic  mainstay  -  could  run  to  $40m.  Between  10  and  12  of  the  80-odd  resorts  have  been  severely  damaged,  and  a  similar  number  have  suffered  significant  damage.  |||    However,  many  experts,  including  the  World  Bank,  have  pointed  out  that  it  is  still  difficult  to  assess  the  magnitude  of  the  disaster  and  its  likely  economic  impact.  In  part,  this  is  because  of  its  scale,  and  because  delivering  aid  and  recovering  the  dead  remain  priorities.  ""Calculators  will  have  to  wait,""  said  an  IMF  official  in  a  briefing  on  Wednesday.  ""The  financial  and  world  community  will  be  turning  toward  reconstruction  efforts  and  at  that  point  people  will  begin  to  have  a  sense  of  the  financial  impact.""" 

2	"Brown  to  outline  presidency  goals  |||    Next  year  will  be  ""make  or  break""  for  development  in  poorer  countries  Gordon  Brown  will  say  as  he  sets  out  UK  goals  for  its  EU  and  G8  presidencies.  |||    The  chancellor  is  due  to  outline  a  series  of  key  targets  the  government  will  be  judged  on  in  2005.  They  will  include  doubling  aid  from  donor  countries  and  eliminating  debt  owed  by  the  poorest  nations.  Mr  Brown  also  wants  other  G8  nations  to  match  his  target  for  overseas  aid  -  spending  0.7%  of  national  income.  |||    He  also  wants  the  richer  countries  to  do  more  to  help  the  development  of  vaccines  for  Aids  and  malaria.  The  chancellor  is  travelling  to  America  next  week  as  part  of  his  persuasion  drive  over  the  issue.  He  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""We  need  more  resources  allied  to  progress  on  trade  and  progress  on  debt  relief  if  we  are  going  to  make  an  impact  on  the  problems  of  ill  health,  of  illiteracy,  of  poverty,  particularly  in  Africa  but  right  through  the  developing  countries.""  |||    His  proposals  were  effectively  a  new  ""Marshall  Plan""  for  the  world,  including  an  international  finance  facility,  which  would  issue  bonds  in  an  attempt  to  double  global  aid  cash  to  $100bn  a  year.  Agreement  in  the  Doha  development  talks  could  also  give  developing  nations  the  trading  ability  they  needed,  he  argued.  The  European  Union's  Common  Agricultural  Policy  had  caused  aggravated  trade  problems,  he  said,  but  there  was  now  an  agreement  to  end  export  subsidies.  |||    Mr  Brown  said  much  had  been  achieved  on  issues  such  as  debt  relief  in  the  last  seven  years.  But  with  30,000  children  were  dying  unnecessarily  every  day  more  was  needed,  including  100%  debt  relief  multilaterally.  ""That  is  why  next  year  is  a  test,""  he  said.  ""If  after  five  years  of  making  promises  the  world  is  not  prepared  to  honour  them,  then  people  will  be  justified  in  saying  they  promised  but  they  did  not  produce  results.""  The  Catholic  aid  agency  Cafod  will  host  Mr  Brown's  speech  on  Wednesday.  |||    Cafod  wants  Britain  to  use  its  influence  to  pressure  countries  like  the  US  to  make  firm  commitments  to  tackle  global  poverty.  Mr  Brown  said  America  too  needed  to  take  more  action  but  defended  President  George  Bush  for  guaranteeing  resources  to  countries  which  introduced  reforms  to  tackle  corruption.  Oxfam's  Paying  the  Price  report  this  week  said  45  million  children  will  die  needlessly  before  2015  and  aid  budgets  are  half  their  1960  levels.  The  charity's  director,  Barbara  Stocking,  said:  ""2005  offers  the  chance  for  an  historic  breakthrough,  but  unless  world  leaders  act  now  the  year  will  end  in  shameful  failure.""  The  report  said  the  G8  of  top  industrialised  nations  had  agreed  in  1970  to  spend  0.7%  of  their  incomes  on  aid.  |||    But  34  years  later  none  of  the  organisations  members  had  reached  this  target  and  many  had  not  yet  set  a  timetable.  Mr  Blair,  who  has  described  Africa  as  a  ""scar""  on  the  world's  conscience,  has  already  said  tackling  world  poverty  would  be  one  his  G8  priorities  along  with  climate  change  and  the  Aids  epidemic.  But  Band  Aid  founder  Bob  Geldof  in  July  said  he  was  sick  of  hearing  ""guff""  about  scars  on  the  world.  It  was  pathetic  that  Britain  was  the  4th  richest  country  in  the  world  but  only  the  11th  most  generous  aid  donor,  he  added.  Conservative  shadow  international  development  secretary  Alan  Duncan  accused  Mr  Brown  of  missing  his  target  on  providing  anti-retroviral  drug  treatment  to  three  million  Africans  by  2005.  Instead,  only  500,000  people  would  benefit,  he  said.  ""There's  no  point  in  him  demanding  praise  and  adulation  for  setting  a  whole  new  raft  of  targets  when  he  has  so  woefully  failed  to  meet  the  ones  he  already  has,""  added  Mr  Duncan."

The  move  comes  as  a  recovery  in  the  US  economy,  the  world's  biggest,  shows  signs  of  robustness  and  sustainability.  The  dollar's  record-breaking  decline,  meanwhile,  has  spooked  markets  and  along  with  high  oil  prices  has  raised  concerns  about  the  pace  of  inflation.  ""We  are  seeing  evidence  that  inflation  is  moving  higher,""  said  Ken  Kim,  an  analyst  at  Stone  &  McCarthy  Research.  ""It's  not  a  risk,  it's  actually  happening.""  Mr  Kim  added  that  borrowing  costs  could  rise  further.  |||    The  Fed  has  said  that  it  will  move  in  a  ""measured""  way  to  combat  price  growth  and  lift  interest  rates  from  their  40-year  lows  that  were  prompted  by  sluggish  US  and  global  growth.  |||    With  the  economic  picture  now  looking  more  rosy,  the  Fed  has  implemented  quarter  percentage  point  rises  in  June,  August,  September  and  November.  Although  the  US  economy  grew  at  an  annual  rate  of  3.9%  in  the  three  months  to  September,  analysts  warn  that  Fed  has  to  be  careful  not  to  move  too  aggressively  and  take  the  wind  out  of  the  recovery's  sails.  Earlier  this  month  figures  showed  that  job  creation  is  still  weak,  while  consumer  confidence  is  subdued.  ""I  think  the  Fed  feels  it  has  a  fair  amount  of  flexibility,""  said  David  Berson,  chief  economist  at  Fannie  Mae.  ""While  inflation  has  moved  up,  it  hasn't  moved  up  a  lot.""  ""If  economic  growth  should  subside...  the  Fed  would  feel  it  has  the  flexibility  to  pause  in  its  tightening.  ""But  if  economic  growth  picked  up  and  caused  core  inflation  to  rise  a  little  more  quickly,  I  think  the  Fed  would  be  prepared  to  tighten  more  quickly  as  well."""

Both  Culture  Secretary  Tessa  Jowell  and  Deputy  Prime  Minister  John  Prescott  have  welcomed  his  return.  ""He  is  a  strong  Labour  Party  member,""  Mr  Prescott  told  BBC  One's  Breakfast  With  Frost  programme.  |||    Mr  Campbell  quit  Number  10  in  August  2003  after  being  Tony  Blair's  right-hand  man  at  the  1997  and  2001  elections.  Labour  have  refused  to  discuss  his  exact  new  position  and  have  not  said  how  it  would  affect  his  Downing  Street  replacement  David  Hill.  ""Of  course  Alastair's  going  to  be  part  of  the  election  campaign  and  I  think  that  all  of  us  who  will  also  be  part  of  the  election  campaign  are  very  pleased  about  that,""  Ms  Jowell  told  Sky  News.  |||    But  she  said  his  return  would  not  put  anybody  else's  ""nose  out  of  joint"".  ""This  is  the  daft  thing  about  the  way  in  which  politics  is  written  about,""  Ms  Jowell  added.  ""There's  room  for  everybody.  We  serve  the  country  better  if  we  make  room  for  all  the  talent.""  A  Labour  source  told  the  Sunday  Times  Mr  Campbell  would  ""effectively  front""  the  election  media  campaign  but  said  he  would  be  given  no  formal  title.  |||    Labour  strategists  told  the  paper  he  would  be  ""set  loose""  on  Conservative  leader  Michael  Howard  in  attacking  his  party's  economic  record  when  it  was  in  power.  ""They  used  pictures  from  the  1970s  in  the  1992  campaign  to  remind  people  of  the  winter  of  discontent  -  and  now  it's  our  turn,""  the  source  told  the  paper.  ""Making  Michael  Howard  leader  gives  us  an  unmissable  opportunity  to  remind  people  what  it  was  like  to  pay  mortgage  rates  of  15%  even  if  it  was  more  than  a  decade  ago.""  Mr  Campbell  was  at  the  centre  of  the  government's  row  with  BBC  over  Andrew  Gilligan's  story  about  the  Iraq  weapons  dossier.  The  Hutton  inquiry  cleared  him  of  ""sexing  up""  the  dossier  in  the  run-up  to  the  Iraq  war.  Since  leaving  Downing  Street,  he  has  toured  the  country  with  his  one  man  show,  An  Audience  With  Alastair  Campbell  and  presented  a  number  of  interview  programmes  for  Channel  4."

Unions  criticised  the  possible  move  -  which  may  affect  cabin  and  maintenance  staff  -  saying  Qantas  was  profitable.  More  than  90%  of  the  airline's  staff  are  based  in  Australia.  |||    Qantas  confirmed  it  was  looking  at  whether  it  might  recruit  and  source  products  overseas  -  potentially  through  joint  ventures  -  but  said  it  would  continue  to  create  jobs  in  Australia.  |||    Despite  making  a  record  Australian  dollars  648m  ($492m)  profit  last  year,  Qantas  has  argued  that  it  needs  to  make  considerable  savings  if  it  is  to  remain  competitive.  ""We're  going  to  have  to  get  the  lowest  cost  structure  we  can  and  that  willmean  sourcing  things  more  and  more  from  overseas,""  the  newspaper  quoted  Qantas  chief  executive  Geoff  Dixon  as  saying.  Early  this  year,  Qantas  increased  the  number  of  flight  attendants  based  in  London  from  370  to  870.  If  Qantas  were  to  follow  the  lead  of  other  airlines  moving  staff  'offshore'  7,000  jobs  could  shift  overseas,  the  newspaper  reported.  In  a  statement,  Qantas  said  it  was  looking  to  build  its  operations  overseas.  However,  it  stressed  this  would  not  result  in  large  scale  redundancies  in  its  home  market,  where  most  of  its  35,000  staff  are  employed.  ""We  are  totally  committed  to  continuing  to  grow  jobs  in  Australia,""  Mr  Dixon  said.  ""We  are,  however,  operating  in  a  global  market  and  there  is  no  room  for  complacency  simply  because  we  are  currently  profitable  and  successful.""  |||    Unions  reacted  angrily  to  the  reported  disclosure,  arguing  that  Qantas  was  profitable  and  did  not  need  to  take  such  action.  ""We  could  understand  if  Qantas  was  a  struggling  airline  about  to  go  under,""  Michael  Mijatov,  international  division  secretary  of  the  Flight  Attendants  Association,  told  Agence  France  Presse.  ""Qantas  announced  a  record  profit  last  year  and  is  on  course  this  year  for  an  even  greater  profit  so  it  is  totally  unnecessary.""  In  an  effort  to  meet  the  challenge  posed  by  low  cost  carriers,  Qantas  sought  a  tie-up  with  Air  New  Zealand  last  year  However,  the  deal  was  thrown  out  by  the  New  Zealand  High  Court  on  competition  grounds."

But,  despite  missing  forecasts  of  53.7,  the  PMI  number  remained  above  50  -  indicating  expansion  in  the  sector.  The  CIPS  said  that  the  strong  pound  had  dented  exports  while  rising  oil  and  metals  prices  had  kept  costs  high.  |||    The  survey  added  that  rising  input  prices  and  cooling  demand  had  deterred  factory  managers  from  hiring  new  workers  in  an  effort  to  cut  costs.  That  triggered  the  second  successive  monthly  fall  in  the  CIPS  employment  index  to  48.3  -  its  lowest  level  since  June  2003.  The  survey  is  more  upbeat  than  official  figures  -  which  suggest  that  manufacturing  is  in  recession  -  but  analysts  said  the  survey  did  suggest  that  the  manufacturing  recovery  was  running  out  of  steam.  ""It  appears  that  the  UK  is  in  a  two-tier  economy  again,""  said  Prebon  Yamane  economist  Lena  Komileva.  ""You  have  weakness  in  manufacturing,  which  I  think  would  concern  policymakers  at  the  Bank  of  England."""

Natasha  Kaplinsky's  Strictly  Come  Dancing  win  was  top  entertainment  moment  and  a  Little  Britain  breast  feeding  sketch  won  the  comedy  prize.  The  2004  TV  Moments  will  be  shown  on  BBC  One  at  2000  GMT  on  Wednesday.  Double  gold  medal  winner  Holmes  topped  the  best  sports  moment  category,  beating  Maria  Sharapova's  Wimbledon  triumph  and  Matthew  Pinsent's  rowing  victory  at  the  Olympics.  |||    She  then  went  on  to  take  the  overall  prize  of  Golden  TV  Moment.  The  sight  of  former  royal  correspondent  Jennie  Bond  with  dozens  of  rats  crawling  over  her  in  ITV's  I'm  a  Celebrity  Get  Me  Out  of  Here  was  named  best  factual  entertainment  moment.  Michael  Buerk's  return  to  Ethiopia,  20  years  after  originally  reporting  its  famine,  topped  the  factual  category  for  BBC  programme  This  World.

In  addition  to  the  penalty,  Monsanto  also  agreed  to  three  years'  close  monitoring  of  its  business  practices  by  the  American  authorities.  It  said  it  accepted  full  responsibility  for  what  it  called  improper  activities.  |||    A  former  senior  manager  at  Monsanto  directed  an  Indonesian  consulting  firm  to  give  a  $50,000  bribe  to  a  high-level  official  in  Indonesia's  environment  ministry  in  2002.  The  manager  told  the  company  to  disguise  an  invoice  for  the  bribe  as  ""consulting  fees"".  |||    Monsanto  was  facing  stiff  opposition  from  activists  and  farmers  who  were  campaigning  against  its  plans  to  introduce  genetically-modified  cotton  in  Indonesia.  Despite  the  bribe,  the  official  did  not  authorise  the  waiving  of  the  environmental  study  requirement.  Monsanto  also  has  admitted  to  paying  bribes  to  a  number  of  other  high-ranking  officials  between  1997  and  2002.  |||    The  chemicals-and-crops  firm  said  it  became  aware  of  irregularities  at  a  Jakarta-based  subsidiary  in  2001  and  launched  an  internal  investigation  before  informing  the  US  Department  of  Justice  and  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC).  Monsanto  faced  both  criminal  and  civil  charges  from  the  Department  of  Justice  and  the  SEC.  ""Companies  cannot  bribe  their  way  into  favourable  treatment  by  foreign  officials,""  said  Christopher  Wray,  assistant  US  attorney  general.  Monsanto  has  agreed  to  pay  $1m  to  the  Department  of  Justice,  adopt  internal  compliance  measures,  and  co-operate  with  continuing  civil  and  criminal  investigations.  It  is  also  paying  $500,000  to  the  SEC  to  settle  the  bribe  charge  and  other  related  violations.  Monsanto  said  it  accepted  full  responsibility  for  its  employees'  actions,  adding  that  it  had  taken  ""remedial  actions  to  address  the  activities  in  Indonesia""  and  had  been  ""fully  co-operative""  throughout  the  investigative  process." 

2	"Blair  moves  to  woo  Jewish  voters  |||    Tony  Blair  has  pledged  to  ""never,  ever,  ever""  attack  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  over  his  Jewish  beliefs.  |||    The  prime  minister  told  the  Jewish  Chronicle:  ""If  you  look  at  what  I  do,  I  attack  Michael  Howard  politically.""  Mr  Blair  also  distanced  himself  from  recent  Labour  campaign  posters  featuring  Mr  Howard,  which  critics  claimed  were  ""anti-Semitic"".  These  were  ""not  intended  to  cause  any  offence  to  anyone  on  the  Jewish  community,""  Mr  Blair  insisted.  |||    One  poster  depicted  Mr  Howard  and  his  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin,  who  is  also  Jewish,  as  flying  pigs.  Another  pictured  the  Tory  leader  swinging  a  pocket  watch  on  a  chain,  which  critics  said  echoed  the  Jewish  money  lender  Shylock  in  Shakespeare's  Merchant  of  Venice.  |||    Others  compared  the  image  to  the  character  Fagin  in  Charles  Dickens'  Oliver  Twist.  Labour  has  since  taken  the  designs  of  its  website,  saying  members  had  preferred  other  designs.  During  his  interview  with  the  Jewish  Chronicle,  Mr  Blair  said:  ""I've  been  a  very  strong  supporter  of  the  Jewish  community  and  Israel,  and  will  always  be  so.""  Pressed  on  whether  he  would  draw  attention  to  Mr  Howard's  Jewish  beliefs  in  an  attempt  to  attract  Muslim  support,  he  replied:  ""The  idea  that  I  would  allow  anybody  to  make  such  a  charge  is  outrageous.  It's  untrue.  ""If  you  look  what  I  do,  I  attack  Michael  Howard  politically.  I  would  never,  ever,  ever  attack  him  on  that  basis.""  |||    Mr  Blair  also  defended  his  party's  attitude  towards  the  Jewish  community,  pointing  out  that  it  was  his  government  that  had  introduced  the  Holocaust  Memorial  Day.  He  added  that  Labour  also  aggressively  fought  all  forms  of  racism.  |||    Neither  the  Conservatives  nor  the  Liberal  Democrats  wished  to  comment  on  Mr  Blair's  words.  The  prime  minister  was  speaking  as  London's  Labour  mayor  Ken  Livingstone  remains  embroiled  in  a  row  over  comments  he  made  to  a  Jewish  reporter  from  the  city's  Evening  Standard  newspaper.  Mr  Blair  repeated  calls  for  the  mayor  to  apologise  for  likening  the  reporter,  Oliver  Finegold,  to  a  concentration  camp  guard.  Mr  Livingstone  ""should  have  withdrawn  the  comment  immediately""  once  he  realised  the  journalist  was  Jewish,  said  Mr  Blair.  ""I'm  sure  that  is  what  in  truth  he  wants  to  do.  Well,  he  should  do  it.""  Mr  Livingstone  has  said  he  could  not  sincerely  say  sorry  for  the  comments  he  made,  and  claims  he  has  been  targeted  by  the  newspaper.  He  conceded  his  comments  may  have  been  offensive  but  were  not  racist,  and  said  earlier  this  week  he  would  not  apologise  even  if  Mr  Blair  asked."

The  Caribbean  island's  government  said  Disney  planned  to  film  in  Dominica.  The  Caribs  have  long  denied  their  ancestors  practised  cannibalism.  Disney  was  unavailable  for  comment.  ""Our  ancestors  stood  up  against  early  European  conquerors  and  because  they  stood  up...we  were  labelled  savages  and  cannibals  up  to  today,""  said  Mr  Williams.  |||    ""This  cannot  be  perpetuated  in  movies.""  Shooting  on  the  sequel  is  expected  to  begin  in  April,  with  hundreds  of  Dominicans  applying  to  be  extras  in  the  movie.  |||    About  3,000  Caribs  live  on  the  island  of  Dominica,  which  has  a  population  of  70,000.  Many  Caribs  were  killed  by  disease  and  war  during  colonisation  up  to  the  1600s.  Mr  Williams  said  he  had  received  support  from  indigenous  groups  around  the  world  in  his  efforts  to  have  cannibalism  references  removed  from  the  film.  But  he  admitted  there  were  some  members  of  the  Carib  council  who  did  not  support  the  campaign.  He  said  some  did  not  ""understand  our  history,  they  are  weak  and  are  not  committed  to  the  cause  of  the  Carib  people"".  The  first  Pirates  of  the  Caribbean  film  took  $305m  (£162m)  at  the  box  office  in  the  US  alone.  The  cast  and  crew  are  to  work  on  two  sequels  back-to-back,  with  the  first  to  be  released  in  2006." 

0	"India  seeks  to  boost  construction  |||    India  has  cleared  a  proposal  allowing  up  to  100%  foreign  direct  investment  in  its  construction  sector.  |||    Kamal  Nath,  Commerce  and  Industry  Minister,  announced  the  decision  in  Delhi  on  Thursday  following  a  cabinet  meeting.  Analysts  say  improving  India's  infrastructure  will  boost  foreign  investment  in  other  sectors  too.  The  Indian  government's  decision  has  spread  good  cheer  in  the  construction  sector,  according  to  some  Indian  firms.  |||    A  spokesman  for  DLF  Builders,  Dr  Vancheshwar,  told  the  BBC  this  will  mean  ""better  offerings""  for  consumers  as  well  as  builders.  He  said  the  firm  will  benefit  from  world  class  ""strategic  partnerships,  design  expertise  and  technology,  while  consumers  will  have  better  choice.""  |||    The  government  proposal  states  that  foreign  investment  of  up  to  100%  will  be  allowed  on  the  'automatic  route'  in  the  construction  sector,  on  projects  including  housing,  hotels,  resorts,  hospitals  and  educational  establishments.  The  automatic  route  means  that  construction  companies  need  only  get  one  set  of  official  approvals  and  do  not  need  to  gain  clearance  from  the  Foreign  Investment  Promotion  Board,  which  can  be  bureaucratic.  The  government  hopes  its  new  policy  will  create  employment  for  construction  workers,  and  benefit  steel  and  brick-making  industries.  |||    Mr  Nath  also  announced  plans  to  allow  foreign  investors  to  develop  a  smaller  area  of  any  land  they  acquired.  ""Foreign  investors  can  enter  any  construction  development  area,  be  it  to  build  resorts,  townships  or  commercial  premises  but  they  will  have  to  construct  at  least  50,000  square  meters  (538,000  square  feet)  within  a  specific  timeframe,""  said  Mr  Nath,  without  specifying  the  timeframe.  Previously  foreign  investors  had  to  develop  a  much  larger  area,  discouraging  some  from  entering  the  Indian  market.  This  measure  is  designed  to  discourage  foreign  investors  from  buying  and  selling  land  speculatively,  without  developing  it.  Anshuman  Magazine,  managing  director,  of  CB  Richard  Ellis  -  an  international  real  estate  company  -  told  the  BBC  this  was  ""a  big  positive  step.""  |||    However,  Chittabrata  Majumdar,  general  secretary  of  the  Centre  of  Indian  Trade  Unions  (CITU),  said  allowing  FDI  in  the  country  is  compromising  India's  own  ""self  reliance"".  He  said,  ""No  country  can  develop  on  the  basis  of  foreign  investment  alone.""  Mr  Majumdar  also  said  an  assessment  should  be  made  as  to  whether  foreign  investment  is  indeed  beneficial  to  the  country  -  in  terms  of  employment  and  money  generated  -  or  just  another  way  of  international  companies  filling  their  deep  pockets."

The  ""pre-masters""  include  a  take  of  Jailhouse  Rock,  religious  songs,  material  for  his  first  Christmas  album,  and  banter  between  Presley,  members  of  his  band  and  engineer  Thorne  Nogar.  |||    ""We've  had  them  for  a  lot  of  years,  and  I  think  the  people  should  enjoy  them,""  Nogar's  son  Stephen,  57,  said.  ""And  frankly,  we  could  use  the  money.""  Nogar,  who  died  in  1994  aged  72,  always  used  to  make  two  tapes  of  sessions  as  a  back-up  in  case  RCA  producers  wanted  to  make  late  changes  to  songs.  ""He  called  them  his  ass-saver  tapes,""  his  son  said.  The  quality  is  said  to  be  noticeably  crisper  than  that  of  a  new  vinyl  record.  Because  the  family  does  not  own  the  copyright  to  the  music,  the  tapes  can  only  be  sold  for  ""personal  enjoyment""  and  they  cannot  be  copied  for  commercial  gain."

It  took  $19.1m  (£9.9m)  on  Christmas  Day  alone,  the  highest  takings  on  that  day  in  box  office  history.  The  sequel  to  the  Ben  Stiller  comedy  Meet  The  Parents  stars  Robert  De  Niro,  Dustin  Hoffman  and  Barbra  Streisand.  The  success  of  Meet  the  Fockers  could  help  produce  record  box  office  revenue  for  2004,  said  Paul  Dergarabedian,  president  of  the  industry's  tracker  Exhibitor  Relations.  ""We've  had  a  much  stronger  than  anticipated  final  week  of  the  year  that  helped  the  industry  end  on  a  high  note,""  said  Mr  Dergarabedian.  |||    Meet  the  Fockers  also  broke  the  box  office  records  for  the  most  money  taken  on  New  Year's  Eve,  when  it  made  $12.2m  (£6.2m),  and  New  Year's  Day,  when  it  took  $18m  (£9.4m).  The  previous  New  Year's  Eve  record  was  set  in  2000  by  Cast  Away  with  $8.5m  (£4.5m).  The  Lord  of  the  Rings:  The  Return  of  the  King  had  held  the  New  Year's  Day  title  with  $12.8m  (£6.7m).  However,  Christmas  takings  were  down  26.5%  on  2003's  figures  -  which  was  blamed  on  Christmas  falling  over  a  weekend  this  year.  This  weekend's  top  12  films  took  an  estimated  $125.4m  (£65.8m),  a  4.3%  increase  on  the  same  weekend  last  year.  But  there  were  no  major  releases  last  week  to  provide  competition  to  Meet  the  Fockers  or  Lemony  Snicket's  A  Series  of  Unfortunate  Events,  which  finished  in  second  place  with  $14.7m  (£7.7m).  The  Aviator,  starring  Leonardo  DiCaprio  as  Howard  Hughes,  ended  up  in  third  position  after  taking  $11.2m  (£5.9m).  Comedy  Fat  Albert  -  co-written  by  Bill  Cosby  -  moved  down  the  chart  to  fourth  place  after  taking  $10.7m  (£5.6m)." 

0	"Oil  rebounds  from  weather  effect  |||    Oil  prices  recovered  in  Asian  trade  on  Tuesday,  after  falling  in  New  York  on  milder  winter  weather  across  the  US.  |||    With  winter  temperatures  staying  relatively  high  in  the  northern  US,  a  barrel  of  light  crude  ended  Monday  down  $1.33  to  $42.12.  However  crude  prices  have  rebounded  in  Asia,  rising  to  $42.30  a  barrel  for  February  delivery.  In  London,  trading  of  Brent  crude  was  suspended  for  a  public  holiday,  but  the  price  fell  to  $39.20  in  the  Far  East.  |||    With  milder  temperatures  expected  to  continue  in  the  northern  parts  of  the  US  over  the  next  few  days  at  least,  analysts  have  said  the  price  of  oil  may  fall  further  -  even  if  the  decline  was  only  temporary.  ""Weather  has  been  the  Achilles'  heel  of  this  market,""  said  ABN  AMRO  analyst  John  Brady.  ""But  it  is  winter  in  the  northeast.  Eventually  we'll  get  another  cold  blast.""  Despite  a  fall  of  more  than  $12  a  barrel  from  the  record  highs  reached  in  late  October,  the  price  of  crude  oil  remains  almost  30%  higher  than  year-ago  levels.  Prices  rose  last  week  after  militant  attacks  in  Riyadh,  the  capital  of  Saudi  Arabia,  briefly  renewed  fears  that  the  supply  chain  might  be  broken  in  the  world's  leading  crude  exporter.  ""The  market  was  panicked  but  fears  essentially  evaporated...  since  there  was  no  follow-up,""  said  Deborah  White,  senior  economist  for  energy  at  SG  Securities  in  Paris." 

2	"Brown  names  16  March  for  Budget  |||    Chancellor  Gordon  Brown  will  deliver  his  Budget  to  the  House  of  Commons  on  16  March,  the  Treasury  has  announced.  |||    The  Budget,  likely  to  be  the  last  before  the  General  Election,  will  be  at  about  1230  GMT  on  that  Wednesday,  just  after  Prime  Minister's  question  time.  The  annual  event  is  when  the  chancellor  outlines  the  government's  taxation  and  broader  economic  predictions.  The  Tories  say  it  is  likely  the  Budget  will  contain  measures  to  attract  votes.  The  election  is  expected  on  5  May.  |||    Next  month's  Budget  will  be  Mr  Brown's  ninth  since  Labour  came  to  power  in  1997.  If  a  May  election  is  called,  there  could  be  as  little  as  18  days  between  the  Budget  and  the  announcement  of  a  date  for  the  election.  A  shortened  Finance  Bill  would  have  to  be  rushed  through  Parliament  with  all-party  support  to  allow  the  Government  to  continue  collecting  revenue.  |||    The  full  Finance  Bill,  with  the  Budget  measures  in  it,  would  then  be  returned  to  the  Commons  after  the  election,  if  Labour  secures  another  term  in  office.  Tory  shadow  chancellor  Oliver  Letwin  said:  ""We  can  be  sure  of  two  things:  the  Budget  will  contain  measures  to  attract  votes,  and  it  will  not  contain  the  £8  billion  of  tax  rises  which  independent  experts  say  are  inevitable  if  Labour  wins  the  election.""  As  Mr  Brown  announced  the  Budget  date  in  a  short  ministerial  statement,  accountancy  firm  Ernst  &  Young  urged  him  to  put  politics  aside  and  focus  on  the  long-term  requirements  of  the  economy.  ""In  the  Budgets  that  were  given  immediately  before  the  last  six  elections,  taxes  were  cut  by  the  incumbent  chancellor  and,  in  many  cases,  taxes  were  increased  soon  after  the  election  result,""  said  Aidan  O'Carroll,  E&Y's  UK  head  of  tax." 

0	"Indian  oil  firm  eyes  Yukos  assets  |||    India's  biggest  oil  exploration  firm,  Oil  &  Natural  Gas  Corp  (ONGC),  says  it  is  in  talks  to  buy  the  former  assets  of  troubled  Russian  crude  producer  Yukos.  |||    ""We  are  in  touch  with  the  concerned  Russian  entities  about  the  Yukos  assets  and  other  opportunities  in  Russia,""  said  ONGC  chairman  Subir  Raha.  Local  press  had  reported  that  ONGC  was  looking  to  buy  15%  of  Yukos'  former  key  oil  production  unit  for  $2bn  (£1bn).  Yukos  is  being  broken  up  by  Russian  authorities  to  pay  a  massive  tax  bill.  |||    It  was  forced  to  sell  its  key  production  unit  Yuganskneftegas  (Yugansk)  last  month  after  being  hit  with  a  bill  of  $27bn  in  unpaid  taxes  and  fines.  |||    State-owned  Rosneft  now  owns  Yugansk  and  Russia  has  said  it  will  turn  the  oil  producer  into  a  stand-alone  firm.  Indian  oil  minister  Mani  Shankar  Aiyar  discussed  ONGC's  plans  during  a  trip  to  Moscow  last  year,  and  the  topic  came  up  again  during  Russian  president  Vladimir  Putin's  recent  visit  to  New  Delhi.  ""It  would  make  great  sense  for  us  to  build  on  that,""  said  Mr  Aiyar.  India's  oil  production  has  stagnated  over  recent  years,  and  it  is  having  to  look  abroad  to  secure  future  supplies.  India  imports  about  70%  of  its  total  oil  consumption.  At  the  same  time,  India's  economy  is  booming  and  the  country's  thirst  for  oil  is  so  strong  that  it  has  helped  pushed  up  the  price  of  crude  worldwide.  |||    India  produces  about  793,000  barrels  of  oil  per  day  (bpd),  little  changed  since  the  start  of  the  1990s,  according  to  oil  industry  analysts  Douglas-Westwood.  Consumption,  meanwhile,  has  jumped  to  2.4  million  bpd,  compared  with  474,000  bpd  in  1973.  |||    ""For  countries  to  develop,  they  have  to  have  access  to  energy,""  said  John  Westwood,  managing  director  of  oil  industry  analysts  Douglas-Westwood.  India  is  a  ""dramatically  growing  economy  that  must  have  access  to  oil"".  By  buying  into  Yugansk,  ONGC  would  be  able  to  reduce  its  dependence  on  Gulf  states  for  oil  imports,  Mr  Westwood  explained,  especially  as  the  chances  of  finding  and  exploiting  resources  within  India  are  slim.  ""We  forecast  that  Indian  production  will  go  into  significant  decline,""  Mr  Westwood  said.  ""By  2020,  production  may  only  be  at  half  of  today's  levels.""  ONGC,  which  is  majority-owned  by  the  Indian  state,  already  has  bought  petroleum  assets  in  countries  including  Vietnam,  Sudan  and  Russia.  The  company  is  a  partner  with  Rosneft  in  the  Sakhalin-1  oil  field  off  Russia's  Siberian  coast.  |||    ONGC  is,  however,  not  the  only  firm  interested  in  Yugansk.  |||    Chinese  crude  company  China  National  Petroleum  has  also  been  mentioned  as  a  possible  investor,  while  on  Thursday,  Italy  refused  to  rule  out  an  interest.  ONGC's  interest  is  the  latest  twist  in  a  saga  that  has  seen  one  of  the  world's  biggest  oil  producers  brought  to  its  knees.  The  dispute  is  partly  driven  by  President  Putin's  clampdown  on  the  political  ambitions  of  ex-Yukos  boss  Mikhail  Khodorkovsky,  who  is  currently  in  jail  on  charges  of  fraud  and  tax  evasion.  Yukos  has  been  battling  the  Russian  authorities  for  more  than  a  year  and  has  filed  for  bankruptcy  protection  in  the  US.  Analysts  have  questioned  how  long  it  can  continue  to  survive  without  Yugansk.  On  Thursday,  a  US  court  said  it  will  hear  arguments  for  Yukos'  bankruptcy  claim  to  be  thrown  out  on  16  February.  Should  that  happen,  Yukos  will  have  little  chance  of  clawing  back  its  assets,  analysts  said." 

2	"Lib  Dems  predict  'best  ever  poll'  |||    The  Lib  Dems  are  set  for  their  best  results  in  both  the  general  election  and  the  local  council  polls,  one  of  their  frontbenchers  has  predicted.  |||    Local  government  spokesman  Ed  Davey  was  speaking  as  the  party  launched  its  campaign  for  the  local  elections  being  held  in  37  English  council  areas.  The  flagship  pledge  is  to  replace  council  tax  with  a  local  income  tax.  The  Tories  say  the  Lib  Dems  would  make  people  pay  more  tax  and  Labour  says  the  party's  sums  do  not  add  up.  Looking  to  the  coming  elections,  which  are  all  expected  to  be  held  on  5  May,  Mr  Davey  said:  ""We  are  going  to  be  winning  more  votes  and  winning  more  seats.  ""I  think  we  are  going  to  have  the  best  general  election  results  and  local  election  results  we  have  ever  had  under  [party  leader]  Charles  Kennedy.  ""I  couldn't  think  of  a  stronger  endorsement  of  a  leader.""" 

2	"Blair's  hope  for  Blunkett  return  |||    The  events  leading  to  David  Blunkett's  resignation  must  not  ""swept  under  the  carpet"",  the  Tories  have  warned.  |||    On  Wednesday  Tony  Blair  said  he  hoped  the  former  home  secretary  would  serve  again  in  government  in  the  future.  Mr  Blunkett  quit  in  December  after  a  probe  linked  him  to  the  visa  application  of  his  ex-lover's  nanny.  Mr  Blair  said  he  left  ""without  a  stain  on  his  character""  but  Tory  Dominic  Grieve  branded  the  way  Mr  Blunkett's  office  operated  as  ""scandalous"".  Mr  Blair  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Today  programme:  ""I  know  David  very  well  and  I  believe  him  to  be  a  man  of  real  integrity  and  real  ability  and  I  was  very  sad  for  him  as  to  what  happened.""  |||    He  said  Mr  Blunkett  still  had  an  immense  amount  to  offer  the  country  but  he  was  not  making  any  ""guarantees  or  definitive  statements""  about  future  jobs.  But  shadow  attorney  general  Mr  Grieve  said:  ""While  I  don't  rule  out  the  possibility  that  Mr  Blunkett  may  return  as  a  minister,  I  don't  think  it's  something  that  can  simply  be  brushed  under  the  carpet.""  Senior  Labour  backbencher  Martin  O'Neill,  who  chairs  the  Commons  trade  committee,  said  he  believed  the  prime  minister  would  want  one  of  his  ""praetorian  guard""  -  a  reference  to  the  elite  body  guard  of  Roman  emperors  -  back  alongside  him.  But  colleague  Ian  Gibson,  who  chairs  the  science  and  technology  committee,  said  there  was  a  ""question  mark""  as  to  whether  Mr  Blunkett  could  serve  at  cabinet  level  again." 

2	"UK  troops  on  Ivory  Coast  standby  |||    Downing  Street  has  confirmed  British  troops  are  on  standby  in  case  they  need  to  help  evacuate  several  hundred  UK  citizens  from  Ivory  Coast.  |||    The  news  came  as  it  emerged  France  had  begun  evacuating  its  hostages  after  days  of  anti-French  demonstrations.  Trouble  flared  after  nine  French  peacekeepers  were  killed  and  President  Jacques  Chirac  ordered  the  destruction  of  the  Ivory  Coast's  air  force.  A  company  of  100-120  UK  troops  is  understood  to  have  been  put  on  standby.  They  are  ready  to  fly  out  and  secure  the  route  from  the  embassy  to  the  airport  if  called  upon.  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair's  official  spokesman  said:  ""There  are  British  nationals  in  Ivory  Coast  and  as  you  can  imagine  we  are  making  the  usual  contingency  plans  in  case  the  situation  deteriorates  further,  but  that's  all  I  can  say  at  this  stage.""  |||    He  added  the  situation  would  be  monitored  carefully  in  case  evacuation  became  necessary.  France  has  played  a  lead  role  in  international  peacekeeping  in  Ivory  Coast  -  a  former  colony  -  after  President  Laurent  Gbagbo  broke  an  18-month  ceasefire  with  rebels  bombing  their  positions  and  killing  the  nine  French  soldiers.  The  decision  to  destroy  the  African  nation's  small  air  force  prompted  riots  against  French  and  other  foreign  nationals.  The  Spanish  have  already  put  their  forces  on  standby  to  evacuate  their  nationals  if  necessary." 

0	"Argentina,  Venezuela  in  oil  deal  |||    Argentina  and  Venezuela  have  extended  a  food-for-oil  deal,  which  helped  the  former  to  overcome  a  severe  energy  crisis  last  year.  |||    Argentine  President  Nestor  Kirchner  and  Venezuelan  President  Hugo  Chavez  signed  the  deal  in  Buenos  Aires  on  Tuesday.  Last  April,  Argentina  signed  a  $240m  agreement  to  import  Venezuelan  fuel  in  exchange  for  agricultural  goods  and  this  deal  has  now  been  extended.  Venezuela  will  now  import  cattle,  medicines  and  medical  equipment.  Last  year,  Argentina's  severe  energy  crisis  forced  President  Kirchner  to  suspend  gas  exports  to  Chile.  Argentina  fears  that  rising  demand  could  spark  another  crisis  and  wants  to  prevent  it  by  signing  this  deal.  The  two  countries  also  formalised  a  co-operation  deal  between  Venezuelan  energy  firm  PDVSA  and  Argentina's  Enarsa.  Under  this  deal,  the  Argentine  market  will  be  opened  to  Venezuelan  investment.  President  Chavez  added  that  Brazil's  Petrobras  could  join  soon  the  co-operation  deal.  President  Chavez  is  an  ardent  promoter  of  the  concept  of  a  South  American  oil  company,  which  could  include  the  state-owned  companies  of  Venezuela,  Argentina,  Brazil  and  Bolivia.  The  two  presidents  also  agreed  to  create  'Television  Sur',  a  Latin  American  network  of  state-owned  television  channels." 

0	"US  prepares  for  hybrid  onslaught  |||    Sales  of  hybrid  cars  in  the  US  are  set  to  double  in  2005,  research  suggests.  |||    Research  group  JD  Power  estimates  sales  will  hit  200,000  in  2005,  despite  higher  prices  and  customer  scepticism.  Carmakers  are  starting  to  build  hybrid  sports  utility  vehicles  (SUVs),  the  four-wheel-drive  vehicles  which  now  dominate  the  US  car  market.  Hybrids  cut  both  petrol  consumption  and  emissions  by  combining  a  petrol  engine  with  an  electric  motor  constantly  kept  charged  by  extra  engine  power.  Several  jurisdictions,  notably  the  state  of  California,  mandate  low  emissions  for  new  cars.  Equally,  the  rise  in  oil  prices  over  the  past  year  has  sparked  hopes  that  consumers  may  be  tempted  by  potential  savings  of  a  few  hundred  dollars  a  year  on  fuel.  |||    At  the  Detroit  Motor  Show,  a  range  of  manufacturers  are  prominently  displaying  their  hybrid  credentials.  Toyota  has  led  the  market  to  date  with  the  Prius,  popularised  by  a  number  of  celebrities  keen  to  burnish  their  ""green""  credentials.  In  April  it  will  launch  a  hybrid  version  of  its  Highlander  SUV,  with  an  SUV  from  its  luxury  Lexus  marque  due  later  in  the  year.  |||    Honda  has  three  hybrids  on  the  market,  and  between  them  the  two  Japanese  carmakers  sold  more  than  80,000  units  last  year.  Ford,  which  has  sold  4,000  of  its  first  hybrid  since  its  launch  in  August,  is  bringing  a  hybrid  SUV  -  the  Mariner  -  to  market  a  year  ahead  of  schedule,  with  plans  for  three  more  models  by  2008.  GM  has  a  hybrid  pickup  on  the  market  and  is  showing  two  concept  SUVs  in  Detroit.  Even  sports  car  maker  Porsche  may  join  the  race,  although  it  insists  it  is  still  considering  whether  to  hybridise  its  Cayenne  SUV.  |||    Others  remain  more  sceptical.  Nissan  has  bought  Toyota's  hybrid  technology,  but  plans  to  bring  out  its  first  model  only  in  2006.  ""We  want  to  make  sure  we  are  not  concentrating  on  one  technology,""  Nissan  chief  executive  Carlos  Ghosn  said.  ""We  will  not  be  surprised  by  any  acceleration  or  deceleration  in  the  hybrid  market.""  Volkswagen,  meanwhile,  says  it  will  focus  on  clean-burning  diesel  engines  instead.  And  some  watchers  point  out  that  the  price  tag  on  a  hybrid  -  upwards  of  $3,000  above  that  of  an  equivalent  normal-engined  car,  and  suspicion  of  the  technology  -  may  still  cool  its  attraction.  ""The  average  consumers  aren't  willing  to  pay  that  premium  for  a  car  they  won't  drive  more  than  six  years,""  said  Anthony  Pratt  from  JD  Power." 

2	"Blair  defends  terror  law  changes  |||    The  prime  minister  has  defended  measures  to  allow  house  arrest  without  trial,  saying  ""several  hundred""  people  in  the  UK  are  plotting  terror  attacks.  |||    The  government  is  facing  opposition  from  Tory  and  Lib  Dem  MPs  and  its  own  backbenchers  as  it  prepares  for  the  final  Commons  debate  on  the  changes.  But  Tony  Blair  said  there  could  be  no  concession  on  the  ""basic  principle"".  Mr  Blair  told  the  BBC  the  ""control  orders""  would  only  be  used  in  the  most  limited  circumstances.  Critics  in  the  opposition  and  civil  rights  activists  are  worried  that  the  home  secretary  will  have  the  power  to  issue  the  detention  orders.  But  the  government  has  so  far  resisted  pressure  for  judges  to  be  responsible  for  making  the  orders,  instead  saying  judges  will  be  able  to  quash  them.  |||    An  explanation  is  being  sent  by  Home  Secretary  Charles  Clarke  to  all  MPs  and  peers  ahead  of  the  final  debate  in  the  House  of  Commons.  On  Sunday,  Conservative  shadow  home  secretary  David  Davis  claimed  judges  would  get  the  powers  to  issue  detention  orders.  And  Liberal  Democrat  leader  Charles  Kennedy  said  some  concessions  had  already  been  offered  by  the  government  during  last-minute  negotiations.  Some  32  Labour  MPs  voted  against  the  legislation  last  week.  Barbara  Follett,  whose  first  husband  was  killed  while  under  house  arrest  in  South  Africa  during  the  apartheid  era,  confirmed  she  would  vote  against  the  government.  |||    But  the  government  is  continuing  to  insist  that  ""control  orders""  must  be  issued  by  the  home  secretary.  Mr  Blair  told  BBC  Radio  4's  Woman's  Hour:  ""We  are  being  advised  by  the  police  and  the  security  services...  ""What  they  say  is  you  have  got  to  give  us  powers  in  between  mere  surveillance  of  these  people  -  there  are  several  hundred  of  them  in  this  country  who  we  believe  are  engaged  in  plotting  or  trying  to  commit  terrorist  acts  -  you  have  got  to  give  us  power  in  between  just  surveying  them  and  being  able,  being  sure  enough  of  the  proof,  to  prosecute  them  beyond  reasonable  doubt.  ""And  these  will  be  restrictions  on  their  liberty  that  we  will  use  only  in  the  most  limited  circumstances.""  |||    A  YouGov  poll  in  the  Daily  Telegraph  suggested  75%  of  respondents  thought  action  was  sometimes  necessary  against  people  who  had  not  committed  an  offence  but  who  had  been  found  by  intelligence  services  to  be  planning  a  terrorist  attack.  But  Tory  leader  Michael  Howard  told  BBC  News  that  the  government  was  again  making  a  mistake  in  ""rushing""  anti-terrorism  legislation.  ""I  very  much  hope  it  would  be  possible  to  reach  a  compromise  on  this.""  He  said  after  meeting  Tony  Blair  he  had  been  left  with  the  impression  that  ""he  really  wasn't  interested  in  any  of  the  various  proposals  we  have  put  forward"".  Mr  Clarke  wants  house  arrest  and  other  powers  to  replace  indefinite  jail  for  terror  suspects  -  something  the  law  lords  have  ruled  against  on  the  basis  that  it  breaches  human  rights.  BBC  political  correspondent  Vicky  Young  said  some  form  of  concession  on  the  measures  was  likely  to  be  needed  to  get  the  legislation  through  the  House  of  Lords,  where  Labour  does  not  have  a  majority  and  would  require  support  from  other  parties.  Shami  Chakrabarti,  director  of  civil  liberties  pressure  group  Liberty,  said  who  was  able  to  issue  the  control  orders  was  not  the  main  issue.  She  said  the  legislation  was  ""a  travesty  and  a  perversion  of  justice""  and  would  remain  ""unpalatable""  even  if  a  judge  was  involved  early  in  the  process." 

3	"O'Driscoll  saves  Irish  blushes  |||    Two  moments  of  magic  from  Brian  O'Driscoll  guided  Ireland  to  a  workmanlike  victory  against  Italy.  |||    A  pair  of  classic  outside  breaks  from  the  Ireland  captain  set  up  tries  for  Geordan  Murphy  and  Peter  Stringer.  Italy  led  9-8  early  in  the  second  half  but  Stringer's  try  gave  Ireland  a  lead  they  never  lost.  The  hosts  cut  the  gap  to  18-12  with  10  minutes  left  and  nearly  scored  through  Ludovico  Nitoglia,  but  Denis  Hickie's  try  ensured  an  Irish  victory.  Italy  came  flying  out  of  the  blocks  and  took  the  lead  through  a  Luciano  Orquera  penalty  after  seven  minutes.  |||    It  could  have  been  better  for  the  hosts  but  the  fly-half  missed  two  kickable  penalties  and  Ireland  drew  level  with  a  Ronan  O'Gara  penalty  midway  through  the  first  half.  The  Italians  were  driving  at  the  heart  of  the  Irish  defence  and,  for  the  first  quarter,  the  Irish  pack  struggled  to  secure  any  ball  for  their  talented  backs.  |||    When  they  finally  did,  just  before  the  half-hour  mark,  O'Driscoll  promptly  created  a  sparkling  try  for  Murphy.  The  Ireland  captain  ran  a  dummy  scissors  and  made  a  magical  outside  break  before  drawing  the  full-back  and  putting  the  diving  Murphy  in  at  the  corner.  O'Gara  missed  the  twice-taken  conversion  and  the  visitors  found  themselves  trailing  once  again.  Roland  de  Marigny  took  over  the  kicking  duties  for  Italy  from  the  hapless  Orquera,  and  he  landed  a  penalty  either  side  of  the  break  to  edge  Italy  into  a  9-8  lead.  |||    The  only  Ireland  player  offering  a  real  threat  was  O'Driscoll,  and  it  was  his  break  that  set  up  the  second  try  for  the  visitors.  Shane  Horgan  threw  an  overhead  pass  as  he  was  about  to  be  forced  into  touch  and  Stringer  scooted  over,  with  O'Gara  landing  the  tricky  conversion.  A  penalty  apiece  saw  Ireland  leading  18-12  as  the  game  entered  the  final  quarter,  but  they  were  lucky  to  survive  when  Italy  launched  a  series  of  attacks.  Winger  Nitoglia  dropped  the  ball  as  he  reached  for  the  line  and  Italy  nearly  rumbled  over  from  a  driving  maul.  |||    An  O'Gara  penalty  put  Ireland  more  than  a  converted  try  ahead  and  they  made  the  game  safe  when  Hickie  latched  onto  an  inside  pass  from  Murphy  and  crossed  for  a  converted  try.  O'Driscoll  limped  off  late  on,  joining  centre  partner  Gordon  D'Arcy  on  the  sidelines,  and  the  final  word  went  to  Italy.  Prop  Martin  Castrogiovanni  powered  over  for  a  try  which  was  fitting  reward  for  an  Italian  pack  which  had  kept  the  Irish  under  pressure  throughout.  |||    De  Marigny;  Mi  Bergamasco,  Canale,  Masi,  Nitoglia;  Orquera,  Troncon;  Lo  Cicero,  Ongaro,  Castrogiovanni;  Dellape,  Bortolami;  Persico,  Ma  Bergamasco,  Parisse.  |||    Perugini,  Intoppa,  Del  Fava,  Dal  Maso,  Griffen,  Pozzebon,  Robertson.  |||    Murphy,  Horgan,  O'Driscoll,  D'Arcy,  Hickie,  O'Gara,  Stringer,  Corrigan,  Byrne,  Hayes,  O'Kelly,  O'Connell,  S  Easterby,  Leamy,  Foley.  |||    Sheahan,  Horan,  O'Callaghan,  Miller,  G  Easterby,  Humphreys,  Dempsey.  |||    P  O'Brien  (New  Zealand)" 

1	"Court  halts  Mark  Morrison  album  |||    Premiership  footballer  and  record  company  boss  Kevin  Campbell  has  gained  a  court  injunction  stopping  R&B  singer  Mark  Morrison  from  releasing  an  album.  |||    The  Everton  striker  signed  Morrison  to  his  fledging  2  Wikid  Records  label  and  claims  he  spent  thousands  of  pounds  producing  his  album  Innocent  Man.  Now  he  is  attempting  to  prevent  Morrison  releasing  the  album  on  Monday  through  another  label.  But  Morrison  vowed  to  ignore  the  order,  saying  ""no  judge  is  gonna  stop  me"".  |||    Morrison,  who  is  now  as  well  known  for  his  brushes  with  the  law  than  his  music  career,  rose  to  fame  with  the  1996  single  Return  of  the  Mack.  |||    But  the  Leicester  singer  has  struggled  to  repeat  its  success  following  two  spells  in  jail.  One  was  for  hiring  a  stand-in  to  complete  his  community  service  for  possession  of  a  stun  gun  and  three-months  following  a  nightclub  fracas.  He  signed  to  Mr  Campbell's  label  a  year  ago  and  has  released  one  single,  with  the  label  saying  the  album  was  due  for  release  on  24  January.  But  Mr  Campbell  said  he  learned  that  Morrison  planned  to  release  the  album  through  Jet  Star,  which  is  advertising  it  on  its  website.  Mr  Campbell  said:  ""I'm  glad  we  were  granted  the  injunction  but  I'm  completely  gutted  that  we  have  had  to  go  that  far.  ""Mark  Morrison  was  given  everything  he  asked  for  by  2  Wikid  but  it  seems  that  he  couldn't  help  but  return  to  his  old  ways.  |||    ""I've  worked  hard  to  realise  my  ambition  in  football  but  had  hoped  that  my  future  career  would  be  in  the  music  business.  ""I  have  always  dreamt  of  starting  a  record  label  but  now  Mark  Morrison  has  spoilt  that  dream  for  me.  There  is  no  loyalty  in  this  business  -  just  greed.""  |||    But  Morrison  is  determined  the  album  will  be  released  on  Monday.  He  said:  ""The  injunction  is  ludicrous.  ""I  signed  a  new  deal  with  a  new  record  company  because  I  was  not  getting  the  support  I  needed  from  2  Wikid.  ""I  was  with  that  label  for  a  year  and  in  that  time  released  just  one  record,  which  was  not  properly  promoted.  He  added:  ""The  whole  world  is  waiting  for  this  album  and  it  will  come  out  on  December  27.  No  injunction  or  judge  will  stop  it.  The  Mack  will  return.""  The  case  is  set  to  be  heard  in  the  High  Court  on  20  December." 

0	"SEC  to  rethink  post-Enron  rules  |||    The  US  stock  market  watchdog's  chairman  has  said  he  is  willing  to  soften  tough  new  US  corporate  governance  rules  to  ease  the  burden  on  foreign  firms.  |||    In  a  speech  at  the  London  School  of  Economics,  William  Donaldson  promised  ""several  initiatives"".  European  firms  have  protested  that  US  laws  introduced  after  the  Enron  scandal  make  Wall  Street  listings  too  costly.  The  US  regulator  said  foreign  firms  may  get  extra  time  to  comply  with  a  key  clause  in  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act.  |||    The  Act  comes  into  force  in  mid-2005.  It  obliges  all  firms  with  US  stock  market  listings  to  make  declarations,  which,  critics  say,  will  add  substantially  to  the  cost  of  preparing  their  annual  accounts.  |||    Firms  that  break  the  new  law  could  face  huge  fines,  while  senior  executives  risk  jail  terms  of  up  to  20  years.  Mr  Donaldson  said  that  although  the  Act  does  not  provide  exemptions  for  foreign  firms,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  would  ""continue  to  be  sensitive  to  the  need  to  accomodate  foreign  structures  and  requirements"".  There  are  few,  if  any,  who  disagree  with  the  intentions  of  the  Act,  which  obliges  chief  executives  to  sign  a  statement  taking  responsibility  for  the  accuracy  of  the  accounts.  But  European  firms  with  secondary  listings  in  New  York  have  objected  -  arguing  that  the  compliance  costs  outweigh  the  benefits  of  a  dual  listing.  The  Act  also  applies  to  firms  with  more  than  300  US  shareholders,  a  situation  many  firms  without  US  listings  could  find  themselves  in.  |||    The  300-shareholder  threshold  has  drawn  anger  as  it  effectively  blocks  the  most  obvious  remedy,  a  delisting.  Mr  Donaldson  said  the  SEC  would  ""consider  whether  there  should  be  a  new  approach  to  the  deregistration  process""  for  foreign  firms  unwilling  to  meet  US  requirements.  |||    ""We  should  seek  a  solution  that  will  preserve  investor  protections""  without  turning  the  US  market  into  ""one  with  no  exit"",  he  said.  He  revealed  that  his  staff  were  already  weighing  up  the  merits  of  delaying  the  implementation  of  the  Act's  least  popular  measure  -  Section  404  -  for  foreign  firms.  Seen  as  particularly  costly  to  implement,  Section  404  obliges  chief  executives  to  take  responsibility  for  the  firm's  internal  controls  by  signing  a  compliance  statement  in  the  annual  accounts.  The  SEC  has  already  delayed  implementation  of  this  clause  for  smaller  firms  -  including  US  ones  -  with  market  capitalisations  below  $700m  (£374m).  |||    A  delegation  of  European  firms  visited  the  SEC  in  December  to  press  for  change,  the  Financial  Times  reported.  |||    It  was  led  by  Digby  Jones,  director  general  of  the  UK's  Confederation  of  British  Industry  (CBI)  and  included  representatives  of  BASF,  Siemens  and  Cadbury  Schweppes.  Compliance  costs  are  already  believed  to  be  making  firms  wary  of  US  listings.  Air  China  picked  the  London  Stock  Exchange  for  its  secondary  listing  in  its  $1.07bn  (£558m)  stock  market  debut  last  month.  There  are  also  rumours  that  two  Chinese  state-run  banks  -  China  Construction  Bank  and  Bank  of  China  -  have  abandoned  plans  for  multi-billion  dollar  listings  in  New  York  later  this  year.  Instead,  the  cost  of  Sarbanes-Oxley  has  persuaded  them  to  stick  to  a  single  listing  in  Hong  Kong,  according  to  press  reports  in  China." 

2	"Blair  sees  greater  Bush  consensus  |||    George  W  Bush  will  display  a  more  consensual  approach  to  world  politics  as  he  begins  his  second  term  as  US  President,  Tony  Blair  has  said.  |||    The  prime  minister  said  Mr  Bush  had  learned  military  force  was  not  the  only  way  to  fight  terrorism.  He  understood  that  ""the  best  prospect  of  peaceful  co-existence  lies  in  the  spread  of  democracy  and  human  rights"",  Mr  Blair  told  the  Guardian  newspaper.  Mr  Bush  was  sworn  in  at  a  ceremony  in  Washington  DC  on  Thursday.  |||    Echoing  the  new  US  Secretary  of  State  Condoleezza  Rice,  the  prime  minister  said  there  has  been  a  clear  evolution  of  US  policy  since  the  war  in  Afghanistan  in  2001.  Mr  Blair  had  personally  seen  the  change  over  time  in  conversations  with  Mr  Bush.  The  president  understood  that  while  military  and  security  measures  were  important,  there  also  needed  to  be  a  multilateral  approach  to  solving  the  world's  problems.  |||    Turning  to  critics'  fears  that  the  US  was  poised  for  further  military  action,  Mr  Blair  refused  to  give  succour  to  suggestions  it  was  preparing  for  strikes  against  Iran.  The  prime  minister  conceded  that  the  US  had  ""what  appears  to  be  a  harder  position""  towards  the  state  than  Europe.  But  the  prime  minister  pointed  out  that  until  now  the  US  had  allowed  Britain,  France  and  Germany  to  take  the  lead  in  trying  to  halt  the  Iranian  nuclear  programme.  Following  claims  that  US  forces  had  worked  inside  Iran  to  identify  potential  targets,  Mr  Blair  was  asked  if  the  SAS  had  also  been  in  the  country.  ""We  never  answer  questions  about  special  forces,  but  do  not  take  that  as  indicating  an  affirmative,""  said  Mr  Blair.  |||    Mr  Blair  said  he  believed  the  president  was  keen  to  work  with  other  countries  while  trying  to  spread  democracy  and  human  rights.  ""It  is  significant,  in  my  view,  that  he  is  coming  to  Europe  as  his  first  foreign  visit,""  said  Mr  Blair.  Following  his  inauguration,  Mr  Bush  is  due  in  Europe  at  the  end  of  January."

1	"'Christmas  song  formula'  unveiled  |||    A  formula  for  the  ultimate  Christmas  single  has  been  revealed  by  chart  bible  British  Hit  Singles  and  Albums.  |||    The  recipe  includes  a  reference  to  Father  Christmas,  sleigh  bells,  a  children's  choir  and  a  charity  element.  The  song  should  also  include  Christmas  in  the  title,  wishes  for  peace  on  earth  and  lots  of  airplay  at  office  parties.  ""There  are  common  musical  elements  linking  nearly  all  the  big  Christmas  number  ones  of  recent  times,""  said  editor  David  Roberts.  The  book's  analysts  commissioned  chart  prank  group  Moped  to  create  the  first  Christmas  single  using  the  whole  formula  -  the  song  is  called  Gonna  Have  a  No  1  This  Christmas  by  Moped  Vs  Santa.  |||    ""Everybody  says  that  Christmas  number  ones  are  formulaic,  but  Gonna  Have  a  Number  One  this  Christmas  is  the  first  song  to  crack  the  formula  and  combine  all  these  elements  into  one  ultimate  Christmas  track""  said  Mr  Roberts.  ""Surprisingly,  there's  no  Santa  listed  among  the  8,000,  top  75  chart  performers  in  the  book,  so  this  is  our  chance  to  help  Santa  to  his  rightful  place  in  British  recording  history.""
